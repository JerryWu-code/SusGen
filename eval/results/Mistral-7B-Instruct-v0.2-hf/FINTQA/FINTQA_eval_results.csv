### Input:
tissue pulp due to strong market demand , partic- ularly from asia . average sales price realizations improved significantly in 2007 , principally reflecting higher average prices for softwood , hardwood and fluff pulp . operating earnings in 2007 were $ 104 mil- lion compared with $ 48 million in 2006 and $ 37 mil- lion in 2005 . the benefits from higher sales price realizations were partially offset by increased input costs for energy , chemicals and freight . entering the first quarter of 2008 , demand for market pulp remains strong , and average sales price realiza- tions should increase slightly . however , input costs for energy , chemicals and freight are expected to be higher , and increased spending is anticipated for planned mill maintenance outages . industrial packaging demand for industrial packaging products is closely correlated with non-durable industrial goods pro- duction , as well as with demand for processed foods , poultry , meat and agricultural products . in addition to prices and volumes , major factors affecting the profitability of industrial packaging are raw material and energy costs , freight costs , manufacturing effi- ciency and product mix . industrial packaging net sales for 2007 increased 6% ( 6 % ) to $ 5.2 billion compared with $ 4.9 bil- lion in 2006 , and 13% ( 13 % ) compared with $ 4.6 billion in 2005 . operating profits in 2007 were 26% ( 26 % ) higher than in 2006 and more than double 2005 earnings . bene- fits from improved price realizations ( $ 147 million ) , sales volume increases net of increased lack of order downtime ( $ 3 million ) , a more favorable mix ( $ 31 million ) , strong mill and converting operations ( $ 33 million ) and other costs ( $ 47 million ) were partially offset by the effects of higher raw material costs ( $ 76 million ) and higher freight costs ( $ 18 million ) . in addition , a gain of $ 13 million was recognized in 2006 related to a sale of property in spain and costs of $ 52 million were incurred in 2007 related to the conversion of the paper machine at pensacola to production of lightweight linerboard . the segment took 165000 tons of downtime in 2007 which included 16000 tons of market-related downtime compared with 135000 tons of downtime in 2006 of which none was market-related . industrial packaging in millions 2007 2006 2005 . <table

3.7 billion in 2006 and $ 3.6 billion in 2005 . operating profits in 2007 were $ 407 million , up from $ 327 mil- lion in 2006 and $ 170 million in 2005 . containerboard shipments were higher in 2007 compared with 2006 , including production from the paper machine at pensacola that was converted to lightweight linerboard during 2007 . average sales price realizations were significantly higher than in 2006 reflecting price increases announced early in 2006 and in the third quarter of 2007 . margins improved reflecting stronger export demand . manu- facturing performance was strong , although costs associated with planned mill maintenance outages were higher due to timing of outages . raw material costs for wood , energy , chemicals and recycled fiber increased significantly . operating results for 2007 were also unfavorably impacted by $ 52 million of costs associated with the conversion and startup of the pensacola paper machine . u.s . converting sales volumes were slightly lower in 2007 compared with 2006 reflecting softer customer box demand . earnings improvement in 2007 bene- fited from the realization of box price increases announced in early 2006 and late 2007 . favorable manufacturing operations and higher sales prices for waste fiber more than offset significantly higher raw material and freight costs . looking ahead to the first quarter of 2008 , sales volumes are expected to increase slightly , and results should benefit from a full-quarter impact of the price increases announced in the third quarter of 2007 . however , additional mill maintenance outages are planned for the first quarter , and freight and input costs are expected to rise , particularly for wood and energy . manufacturing operations should be favorable compared with the fourth quarter . european industrial packaging net sales for 2007 were $ 1.1 billion , up from $ 1.0 billion in 2006 and $ 880 million in 2005 . sales volumes were about flat as early stronger demand in the industrial segment weakened in the second half of the year . operating profits in 2007 were $ 88 million compared with $ 69 million in 2006 and $ 53 million in 2005 . sales margins improved reflecting increased sales prices for boxes . conversion costs were favorable as the result of manufacturing improvement programs . entering the first quarter of 2008 , sales volumes should be strong seasonally across all regions as the winter fruit and vegetable season continues . profit margins , however , are expected to be somewhat lower. .
Question: what is the value of european industrial packaging net sales for 2007 times 1000?
Answer: 1100.0
Question: what is that divided by total 2007 sales?


[/INST]### Response:
","The value of European industrial packaging net sales for 2007 is 1.1 billion dollars. To find the value when multiplied by 1000, we simply add three zeros to the end of the number: 1.1 billion = 1100.0 million. Therefore, the answer to the first question is 1100.0.

To calculate the percentage of European industrial packaging net sales representing the total 2007 sales, we can use the given information that European industrial packaging net sales for 2007 were 1.1 billion dollars and total 2007 sales were 5.2 billion dollars. We can then divide the former by the latter and multiply by 100 to get the percentage:

(1100.0 / 5245) * 100 = 21.07%

Therefore, the answer to the second question is approximately 21.07%.",0.20972,Yes

the year ended december 31 , 2011 with the year ended december 31 , 2010 . net revenues , which include excise taxes billed to customers , decreased $ 221 million ( 1.0% ( 1.0 % ) ) due to lower shipment volume ( $ 1051 million ) , partially offset by higher net pricing ( $ 830 million ) , which includes higher promotional investments . operating companies income increased $ 119 million ( 2.1% ( 2.1 % ) ) , due primarily to higher net pricing ( $ 831 million ) , which includes higher promotional investments , marketing , administration , and research savings reflecting cost reduction initiatives ( $ 198 million ) and 2010 implementation costs related to the closure of the cabarrus , north carolina manufacturing facility ( $ 75 million ) , partially offset by lower volume ( $ 527 million ) , higher asset impairment and exit costs due primarily to the 2011 cost reduction program ( $ 158 million ) , higher per unit settlement charges ( $ 120 million ) , higher charges related to tobacco and health judgments ( $ 87 million ) and higher fda user fees ( $ 73 million ) . for 2011 , total smokeable products shipment volume decreased 4.0% ( 4.0 % ) versus 2010 . pm usa's reported

Question: what was the difference in total shipment volume between 2010 and 2011?
Answer: 10.2
Question: and the specific value for 2010?
Answer: 724.4
Question: so what was the growth rate over this time?


[/INST]### Response:
","The difference in total shipment volume between 2010 and 2011 was -10.2 million units. Therefore, the growth rate can be calculated as follows:

[(Difference in total shipment volume) / Total shipment volume in base year] x 100%

=[(-10.2 million units) / 724.4 million units] x 100%

≈-1.4%

So, there was a decrease of approximately 1.4% in total shipment volume between 2010 and 2011.",0.01408,Yes

we hold an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the benchmark interest rate of our $ 375 million 5.0% ( 5.0 % ) senior unsecured notes due july 1 , 2014 . the effect of the swap is to convert our 5.0% ( 5.0 % ) fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate based on the three-month libor plus 2.05% ( 2.05 % ) ( 2.42% ( 2.42 % ) as of october 29 , 2011 ) . in addition , we have a term loan facility of $ 145 million that bears interest at a fluctuating rate for each period equal to the libor rate corresponding with the tenor of the interest period plus a spread of 1.25% ( 1.25 % ) ( 1.61% ( 1.61 % ) as of october 29 , 2011 ) . if libor increases by 100 basis points , our annual interest expense would increase by approximately $ 5 million . however , this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on our $ 375 million of 3% ( 3 % ) fixed-rate debt , which is not hedged . as of october 30 , 2010 , a similar 100 basis point increase in libor would have resulted in an increase of approximately $ 4 million to our annual interest expense . foreign currency exposure as more fully described in note 2i in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k , we regularly hedge our non-u.s . dollar-based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts . the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months . currently , our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro , primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses . relative to foreign currency exposures existing at october 29 , 2011 and october 30 , 2010 , a 10% ( 10 % ) unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would expose us to approximately $ 6 million in losses in earnings or cash flows . the market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions , assets and liabilities being hedged . the counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings . based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of october 29 , 2011 , we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them . while the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions , they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk . the amounts potentially subject to credit risk ( arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts ) are generally limited to the amounts , if any , by which the counterparties 2019 obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties . the following table illustrates the effect that a 10% ( 10 % ) unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates , relative to the u.s . dollar , would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of october 29 , 2011 and october 30 , 2010: . <table class='wikitable'><tr><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>october 29 2011</td><td>october 30 2010</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>fair value of forward exchange contracts asset</td><td>$ 2472</td><td>$ 7256</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% ( 10 % ) unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset</td><td>$ 17859</td><td>$ 22062</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% ( 10 % ) favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability</td><td>$ -13332 ( 13332 )</td><td>$ -7396 ( 7396 )</td></tr></table> fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% ( 10 % ) unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 17859 $ 22062 fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% ( 10 % ) favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ ( 13332 ) $ ( 7396 ) the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the u.s . dollar . in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates , such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors 2019 products become more or less attractive . our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices. .

Question: in the year of 2008, what was the variance of the foreign exchange products in the first section?
Answer: 4.4
Question: and what was it in the second section?
Answer: 3.3
Question: what was, then, the combined total variance for both sections?
Answer: 7.7
Question: and what was the average variance between them?
Answer: 3.85
Question: in that same year, what was the combined total for the annual average related to interest-rate products, also in both sections?


[/INST]### Response:
","The variance of the foreign exchange products in the first section was $4.7 million. In the second section, the variance for interest-rate products was $3.7 million. Therefore, the combined total variance for both sections was $8.4 million ($4.7 + $3.7). The average variance between the two sections can be calculated by adding the variances and dividing by two: ($4.7 + $3.7) / 2 = $3.85 million. However, there seems to be a mistake in the text regarding the question about the combined total annual average related to interest-rate products in the year of 2008. According to the given table, the annual averages for interest-rate products were $1.4 million and $3.7 million respectively for the two sections. So, the correct answer should be $2.1 million ($1.4 + $3.7)/2 instead of $1.4+$3.7=$4.7 as mentioned in the text.",2.5,No

Question: what is the net change in loews common stock from 2013 to 2014?


[/INST]### Response:
","The net change in Loews common stock from 2013 to 2014 can be calculated as follows:

First, find the difference between the closing prices of Loews common stock in these two years: 152.84 - 110.59 = 42.25

Next, determine if there were any dividends paid during this time period that would affect the net change. According to the text, Loews paid regular dividends of $0.0625 per share in each quarter of both 2013 and 2014. Since there were four quarters in a year, the total amount of dividends paid annually was $0.0625 * 4 = $0.25 per share. To calculate the effect of dividends on the net change, subtract the total amount of dividends received during this period from the difference found earlier: 42.25 - ($0.25 * 2) = 42.2025

Therefore, the net change in Loews common stock from 2013 to 2014, after considering the impact of dividends, is approximately $42.2025 or 42.20%.",-15.64,No

Question: how much did the weighted average exercise price per share increase between 2005 and 2007?
Answer: 35.8
Question: so what was the percentage change during this time?


[/INST]### Response:
","The weighted average exercise price per share increased from $ 25.14 in 2005 to $ 60.94 in 2007. To find the percentage change, we can use the formula:

Percentage Change = ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) x 100%

Substituting the values given, we get:

Percentage Change = ((60.94 - 25.14) / 25.14) x 100%

Calculating the above expression, we get:

Percentage Change = (35.8) / (25.14) x 100%
Percentage Change ≈ 139.37%

Therefore, the weighted average exercise price per share increased approximately 139.37% between 2005 and 2007.",1.42403,No

Question: what is the difference between the fair and the carrying value of all notes?
Answer: 345.0
Question: and what was that carrying value for only the notes due in 2014?
Answer: 1000.0
Question: what was it for 2015?
Answer: 750.0
Question: what was, then, the total carrying value for both years?
Answer: 1750.0
Question: and including the 2017 notes, what becomes this total?


[/INST]### Response:
","The difference between the fair value and carrying value of all notes is $5284 million - $4939 million = $345.1 million.

To find the carrying values for the notes due in 2014 and 2015 specifically, we can refer back to the table provided. For the notes due in 2014, the carrying value is listed as $1000 million. For the notes due in 2015, the carrying value is listed as $750 million.

Therefore, the total carrying value for the notes due in 2014 and 2015 is $1000 million + $750 million = $1750 million.

However, if we include the notes due in 2017 as well, the total carrying value would depend on their carrying value, which is given as $812 million in the text. So, the updated total carrying value would be $1750 million (for 2014 and 2015) + $812 million (for 2017) = $2562 million. But since the question asked for the difference between fair and carrying value, and not the total carrying value itself, the final answer remains $345.1 million.",2448.0,No

Question: what was the change in total net goodwill between 2010 and 2011?
Answer: -492.0
Question: and what is this change as a percent of that net goodwill in 2010?


[/INST]### Response:
","The change in total net goodwill between 2010 and 2011 can be calculated by subtracting the net goodwill at December 31, 2010 ($2383) from the net goodwill at December 31, 2011 ($1891). Therefore, the change is $-492 or -492.0 million.

To find the percentage change, divide the change (-492.0) by the net goodwill at December 31, 2010 ($2383) and multiply by 100%. So, the percentage change is approximately -20.3% (rounded to one decimal place).",-0.20646,No

Question: between the years of 2016 and 2017, what was the change in the number of class a common stocks issued and outstanding?
Answer: 995.0
Question: and in that year of 2017, what percentage did this number represent in relation to the total amount of class a common stock authorized?


[/INST]### Response:
","To find the change in the number of Class A common stocks issued and outstanding between 2016 and 2017, we can subtract the number of Class A common stocks issued and outstanding in December 2016 from the number in December 2017 according to the given table:

Change = Class A common stocks issued and outstanding (December 2017) - Class A common stocks issued and outstanding (December 2016)
= 338,240 - 338,231
= 9

However, since the question asks for the answer in thousands, we need to add zeros to make it 9,000 instead of just 9. Therefore, the change in the number of Class A common stocks issued and outstanding between 2016 and 2017 was 9,000.

Now, let's calculate the percentage of Class A common stocks issued and outstanding in relation to the total amount of Class A common stock authorized in 2017:

Percentage = (Class A common stocks issued and outstanding / Total Class A common stocks authorized) * 100%
= (338,240 / 1,000,000) * 100%
= 0.033824 * 100%
= 33.824%

Therefore, the answer to the second question is that the number of Class A common stocks issued and outstanding represented 33.824% of the total amount of Class A common stock authorized in 2017.",0.33924,Yes

earnings for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to be lower than in the fourth quarter of 2006 . containerboard export sales volumes are expected to decline due to scheduled first-quarter main- tenance outages . sales volumes for u.s . converted products will be higher due to more shipping days , but expected softer demand should cause the ship- ments per day to decrease . average sales price real- izations are expected to be comparable to fourth- quarter averages . an additional containerboard price increase was announced in january that is expected to be fully realized in the second quarter . costs for wood , energy , starch , adhesives and freight are expected to increase . manufacturing costs will be higher due to costs associated with scheduled main- tenance outages in the containerboard mills . euro- pean container operating results are expected to improve as seasonally higher sales volumes and improved margins more than offset slightly higher manufacturing costs . consumer packaging demand and pricing for consumer packaging prod- ucts correlate closely with consumer spending and general economic activity . in addition to prices and volumes , major factors affecting the profitability of consumer packaging are raw material and energy costs , manufacturing efficiency and product mix . consumer packaging net sales increased 9% ( 9 % ) compared with 2005 and 7% ( 7 % ) compared with 2004 . operating profits rose 8% ( 8 % ) from 2005 , but declined 15% ( 15 % ) from 2004 levels . compared with 2005 , higher sales volumes ( $ 9 million ) , improved average sales price realizations ( $ 33 million ) , reduced lack-of-order downtime ( $ 18 million ) , and favorable mill oper- ations ( $ 25 million ) were partially offset by higher raw material

and $ 1.1 billion in 2004 . sales volumes increased in 2006 compared with 2005 , particularly in the folding car- ton board segment , reflecting improved demand for coated paperboard products . in 2006 , our coated paperboard mills took 4000 tons of lack-of-order downtime , compared with 82000 tons of lack-of-order downtime in 2005 . average sales price realizations were substantially improved in the cur- rent year , principally for folding carton board and cupstock board . operating profits were 51% ( 51 % ) higher in 2006 than in 2005 , and 7% ( 7 % ) better than in 2004 . the impact of the higher sales prices along with more favorable manufacturing operations due to strong performance at the mills more than offset higher input costs for energy and freight . foodservice net sales declined to $ 396 million in 2006 , compared with $ 437 million in 2005 and $ 480 million in 2004 , due principally to the sale of the jackson , tennessee plant in july 2005 . sales vol- umes were lower in 2006 than in 2005 , although average sales prices were higher due to the realiza- tion of price increases implemented during 2005 . operating profits for 2006 improved over 2005 and 2004 levels largely due to the benefits from higher sales prices . raw material costs for bleached board were higher than in 2005 , but manufacturing costs were more favorable due to increased productivity

Question: what is the ratio of the differences in capital from 2008 to 2007?


[/INST]### Response:
","The difference between total capital and tier 1 capital in 2008 was $71.0 - $23.899 = $47.101 billion. Therefore, the answer to the first question is $47.101 billion.

The total capital in 2007 was $121.6 billion, so the second answer is $121.6 billion.

The tier 1 capital in 2007 was $82.0 billion, so the third answer is $39.6 billion ($121.6 - $82.0).

To find the ratio of the differences in capital from 2008 to 2007, we can divide the absolute value of the difference by the smaller value: |$47.101 - $39.6| / min(|$47.101|, $|$39.6|) = 0.192 or 19.2%. Therefore, the fourth answer is 19.2%.",0.94444,No

Question: what is the total goodwill?
Answer: 14722.0
Question: what about total assets?
Answer: 867558.0
Question: what fraction comes from goodwill?
Answer: 0.01697
Question: what about in percentage?


[/INST]### Response:
","The total goodwill mentioned in the text is 14722.0. Therefore, the answer to the first question is ""the total goodwill is 14722.0.""

To find the total assets, you can refer to the table where it shows a total of 867558.0 for all assets acquired. So, the second question's answer would be ""the total assets are 867558.0.""

Regarding your third question, to calculate the fraction of goodwill out of the total assets, divide the goodwill by the total assets:

Fraction = Goodwill / Total Assets
= 14722.0 / 867558.0
≈ 0.01697

Finally, to express this as a percentage, multiply the decimal fraction by 100%:

Percentage = Fraction * 100%
≈ 1.697%",1.69695,No

Question: what was the change in the value of the interest retained by upri from 2007 to 2008?
Answer: -40.0
Question: and how much does this change represent in relation to that value in 2007, in percentage?


[/INST]### Response:
","The text states that the value of the interest retained by UPRI was $471 million at December 31, 2007. To find the change in the value of the interest retained by UPRI between 2007 and 2008, subtract the value in 2008 ($431 million) from the value in 2007:

$-471M + $431M = $-40M

To calculate the percentage change, divide the difference by the initial value and multiply by 100%:

$\frac{-$40M}{$471M} \times 100\% \approx -8.5\%$

Therefore, the change represents an approximate 8.5% decrease in relation to the value in 2007.",-0.08493,No

Question: what is the net change in the value of commodities from 2016 to 2017?


[/INST]### Response:
","The given text does provide the net amount of commodities for both years, which is $73 for the year 2016 and $47 for the year 2017. To find the net change in the value of commodities, we simply subtract the earlier value from the later value:

Net Change = Commodity Value (Year 2017) - Commodity Value (Year 2016)
= $47 - $73
= -$26

So, the net change in the value of commodities from 2016 to 2017 was a decrease of $26 million.",-26.0,No

Question: what is the net change of securities between 2008 and 2009?


[/INST]### Response:
","
To calculate the net change of securities between 2008 and 2009, we need to find the difference between the total fair value of securities in 2009 and the total fair value of securities in 2008, adjusting for the net unrealized losses reported in each year.

First, let's calculate the total fair value of securities for each year:

Total Fair Value 2008 = Amortized Cost 2008 + Fair Value 2008
                      = 60786 + 54163
                      = 114949

Total Fair Value 2009 = Amortized Cost 2009 + Fair Value 2009
                      = 74843 + 72699
                      = 147542

Next, let's account for the net unrealized losses reported in each year:

Net Unrealized Loss Pre-Tax 2008 = Net Unrealized Loss After-Tax 2008 + Tax Rate * Net Unrealized Loss Pre-Tax 2008
                               = 4057 + 0.35 * (-6057)
                               = 4057 - 2117.65
                               = 1939.35

Net Unrealized Loss Pre-Tax 2009 = Net Unrealized Loss After-Tax 2009 + Tax Rate * Net Unrealized Loss Pre-Tax 2009
                               = 1316 + 0.35 * (-1316)
                               = 1316 - 461.1
                               = 854.9

Now, let's subtract the net unrealized losses from their respective years' total fair values:

Adjusted Total Fair Value 2008 = Total Fair Value 2008 - Net Unrealized Loss Pre-Tax 2008
                             = 114949 - 1939.35
                             ≈ 112999.65

Adjusted Total Fair Value 2009 = Total Fair Value 2009 - Net Unrealized Loss Pre-Tax 2009
                             = 147542 - 854.9
                             ≈ 146687.1

Finally, let's determine the net change of securities between 2008 and 2009:

Net Change of Securities = Adjusted Total Fair Value 2009 - Adjusted Total Fair Value 2008
                        = 146687.1 - 112999.65
                        ≈ 33687.45

So, the net change of securities between 2008 and 2009 is approximately $33,687.45 million.",18536.0,No

Question: in 2013, what was the ratio of sales to operating income?
Answer: 6.88702
Question: and in 2012?


[/INST]### Response:
","The ratio of sales to operating income for the given time periods can be calculated by dividing the sales figure by the operating income figure for each year.

For the year 2013:
Sales = $451.1
Operating Income = $65.5
Ratio of Sales to Operating Income = Sales / Operating Income = $451.1 / $65.5 ≈ 6.88702

For the year 2012:
Sales = $420.1
Operating Income = $44.6
Ratio of Sales to Operating Income = Sales / Operating Income = $420.1 / $44.6 ≈ 9.45341

Therefore, the answers to the questions would be:

Answer: The ratio of sales to operating income for Equipment and Energy Business in 2013 was approximately 6.88702, while in 2012 it was around 9.45341.",9.41928,Yes

### Input:
tissue pulp due to strong market demand , partic- ularly from asia . average sales price realizations improved significantly in 2007 , principally reflecting higher average prices for softwood , hardwood and fluff pulp . operating earnings in 2007 were $ 104 mil- lion compared with $ 48 million in 2006 and $ 37 mil- lion in 2005 . the benefits from higher sales price realizations were partially offset by increased input costs for energy , chemicals and freight . entering the first quarter of 2008 , demand for market pulp remains strong , and average sales price realiza- tions should increase slightly . however , input costs for energy , chemicals and freight are expected to be higher , and increased spending is anticipated for planned mill maintenance outages . industrial packaging demand for industrial packaging products is closely correlated with non-durable industrial goods pro- duction , as well as with demand for processed foods , poultry , meat and agricultural products . in addition to prices and volumes , major factors affecting the profitability of industrial packaging are raw material and energy costs , freight costs , manufacturing effi- ciency and product mix . industrial packaging net sales for 2007 increased 6% ( 6 % ) to $ 5.2 billion compared with $ 4.9 bil- lion in 2006 , and 13% ( 13 % ) compared with $ 4.6 billion in 2005 . operating profits in 2007 were 26% ( 26 % ) higher than in 2006 and more than double 2005 earnings . bene- fits from improved price realizations ( $ 147 million ) , sales volume increases net of increased lack of order downtime ( $ 3 million ) , a more favorable mix ( $ 31 million ) , strong mill and converting operations ( $ 33 million ) and other costs ( $ 47 million ) were partially offset by the effects of higher raw material costs ( $ 76 million ) and higher freight costs ( $ 18 million ) . in addition , a gain of $ 13 million was recognized in 2006 related to a sale of property in spain and costs of $ 52 million were incurred in 2007 related to the conversion of the paper machine at pensacola to production of lightweight linerboard . the segment took 165000 tons of downtime in 2007 which included 16000 tons of market-related downtime compared with 135000 tons of downtime in 2006 of which none was market-related . industrial packaging in millions 2007 2006 2005 . <table

3.7 billion in 2006 and $ 3.6 billion in 2005 . operating profits in 2007 were $ 407 million , up from $ 327 mil- lion in 2006 and $ 170 million in 2005 . containerboard shipments were higher in 2007 compared with 2006 , including production from the paper machine at pensacola that was converted to lightweight linerboard during 2007 . average sales price realizations were significantly higher than in 2006 reflecting price increases announced early in 2006 and in the third quarter of 2007 . margins improved reflecting stronger export demand . manu- facturing performance was strong , although costs associated with planned mill maintenance outages were higher due to timing of outages . raw material costs for wood , energy , chemicals and recycled fiber increased significantly . operating results for 2007 were also unfavorably impacted by $ 52 million of costs associated with the conversion and startup of the pensacola paper machine . u.s . converting sales volumes were slightly lower in 2007 compared with 2006 reflecting softer customer box demand . earnings improvement in 2007 bene- fited from the realization of box price increases announced in early 2006 and late 2007 . favorable manufacturing operations and higher sales prices for waste fiber more than offset significantly higher raw material and freight costs . looking ahead to the first quarter of 2008 , sales volumes are expected to increase slightly , and results should benefit from a full-quarter impact of the price increases announced in the third quarter of 2007 . however , additional mill maintenance outages are planned for the first quarter , and freight and input costs are expected to rise , particularly for wood and energy . manufacturing operations should be favorable compared with the fourth quarter . european industrial packaging net sales for 2007 were $ 1.1 billion , up from $ 1.0 billion in 2006 and $ 880 million in 2005 . sales volumes were about flat as early stronger demand in the industrial segment weakened in the second half of the year . operating profits in 2007 were $ 88 million compared with $ 69 million in 2006 and $ 53 million in 2005 . sales margins improved reflecting increased sales prices for boxes . conversion costs were favorable as the result of manufacturing improvement programs . entering the first quarter of 2008 , sales volumes should be strong seasonally across all regions as the winter fruit and vegetable season continues . profit margins , however , are expected to be somewhat lower. .
Question: in the year of 2007, what was the amount of the industrial packaging sales that was from europe, in millions?
Answer: 1100.0
Question: and what was the total of those sales?
Answer: 5245.0
Question: what percentage, then, of this total did that amount represent?
Answer: 0.20972
Question: and what was this percentage in the previous year, in 2006?


[/INST]### Response:
","The text states that European industrial packaging sales for the year 2007 were $1.1 billion. To find the percentage of the total sales represented by European sales in 2007, we need to divide the European sales figure by the total sales figure. According to the text, the total sales for industrial packaging in 2007 were $5.245 billion. Therefore, the percentage of European sales in the total sales for 2007 can be calculated as follows:
```
European sales / Total sales = European sales percentage
$1,100,000,000 / $5,245,000,000 = 0.20972 or approximately 21%
```
To find the corresponding percentage in the previous year, we would use the same formula but with the European sales figure for 2006 ($1,000,000,000) and the total sales figure for 2006 ($4,925,000,000):
```
European sales / Total sales = European sales percentage
$1,000,000,000 / $4,925,000,000 = 0.20306 or approximately 20.3%
```
Therefore, the percentage of European sales in the total sales for 2006 was around 20.3%.",0.20305,Yes

Question: what's the portion of fair value to carrying value?


[/INST]### Response:
","The portion of fair value to carrying value can be calculated by dividing the fair value by the carrying value for each individual debt instrument. Here's how it looks for the given data:

For 2015 notes:
Fair Value = $753 million
Carrying Value = $750 million
Portion of Fair Value to Carrying Value = $753 million / $750 million = 1.0053 or 100.53%

For 2017 notes:
Fair Value = $785 million
Carrying Value = $699 million
Portion of Fair Value to Carrying Value = $785 million / $699 million = 1.1216 or 112.16%

For 2019 notes:
Fair Value = $1134 million
Carrying Value = $998 million
Portion of Fair Value to Carrying Value = $1134 million / $998 million = 1.1343 or 113.43%

For 2021 notes:
Fair Value = $825 million
Carrying Value = $747 million
Portion of Fair Value to Carrying Value = $825 million / $747 million = 1.1027 or 110.27%

For 2022 notes:
Fair Value = $783 million
Carrying Value = $747 million
Portion of Fair Value to Carrying Value = $783 million / $747 million = 1.0431 or 104.31%

For 2024 notes:
Fair Value = N/A (issued in March 2014)
Carrying Value = $4938 million
Portion of Fair Value to Carrying Value = N/A

Please note that the percentages above represent the relationship between the fair value and carrying value, but they do not necessarily indicate whether the fair values are higher or lower than the carrying values. In some cases, the fair values might be greater; in others, they might be smaller.",1.07513,No

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists , delivery of product has occurred , the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured . for our company , this means that revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred to our customers . title transfers to our customers upon shipment or upon receipt at the customer's location as determined by the sales terms for each transaction . the company estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience , and these estimates are normally immaterial . 2022 goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets valuation - we test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review . we perform our annual impairment analysis in the first quarter of each year . while the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists , the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis . the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value . if the carrying value exceeds the fair value , goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired . to determine the fair value of goodwill , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model , supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global and local companies within the tobacco industry . at december 31 , 2015 , the carrying value of our goodwill was $ 7.4 billion , which is related to ten reporting units , each of which is comprised of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics . the estimated fair value of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 , 2015 . to determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-royalty method . we concluded that the fair value of our non-amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value , and any reasonable movement in the assumptions would not result in an impairment . these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows , which are subject to changes in business conditions , such as volumes and prices , costs to produce , discount rates and estimated capital needs . management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated , and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use . since the march 28 , 2008 , spin-off from altria , we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or non-amortizable intangible assets . 2022 marketing and advertising costs - we incur certain costs to support our products through programs which include advertising , marketing , consumer engagement and trade promotions . the costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with u.s . gaap . recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program . for volume-based incentives provided to customers , management continually assesses and estimates , by customer , the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made . for other trade promotions , management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience . changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position , results of operations or operating cash flows . we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate our marketing programs during the past three years . 2022 employee benefit plans - as discussed in item 8 , note 13 . benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements , we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees , including pensions , postretirement health care and postemployment benefits ( primarily severance ) . we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by u.s . gaap . these calculations include various actuarial assumptions , such as discount rates , assumed rates of return on plan assets , compensation increases , mortality , turnover rates and health care cost trend rates . we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so . as permitted by u.s . gaap , any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods . we believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries . weighted-average discount rate assumptions for pensions and postretirement plans are as follows: . <table class='wikitable'><tr><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>2015</td><td>2014</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>u.s . pension plans</td><td>4.30% ( 4.30 % )</td><td>3.95% ( 3.95 % )</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>non-u.s . pension plans</td><td>1.68% ( 1.68 % )</td><td>1.92% ( 1.92 % )</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>postretirement plans</td><td>4.45% ( 4.45 % )</td><td>4.20% ( 4.20 % )</td></tr></table> we anticipate that assumption changes , coupled with decreased amortization of deferred losses , will decrease 2016 pre-tax u.s . and non- u.s . pension and postretirement expense to approximately $ 209 million as compared with approximately $ 240 million in 2015 , excluding .

respectively . we view home equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only , as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments . based upon outstanding balances , and excluding purchased impaired loans , at december 31 , 2011 , for home equity lines of credit for which the borrower can no longer draw ( e.g. , draw period has ended or borrowing privileges have been terminated ) , approximately 4.32% ( 4.32 % ) were 30-89 days past due and approximately 5.57% ( 5.57 % ) were greater than or equal to 90 days past due . generally , when a borrower becomes 60 days past due , we terminate borrowing privileges , and those privileges are not subsequently reinstated . at that point , we continue our collection/recovery processes , which may include a loss mitigation loan modification resulting in a loan that is classified as a tdr . see note 5 asset quality and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information . loan modifications and troubled debt restructurings consumer loan modifications we modify loans under government and pnc-developed programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure , where appropriate . initially , a borrower is evaluated for a modification under a government program . if a borrower does not qualify under a government program , the borrower is then evaluated under a pnc program . our programs utilize both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate , extend the term and/or defer principal . temporary and permanent modifications under programs involving a change to loan terms are generally classified as tdrs . further , certain payment plans and trial payment arrangements which do not include a contractual change to loan terms may be classified as tdrs . additional detail on tdrs is discussed below as well as in note 5 asset quality and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report . a temporary modification , with a term between three and 60 months , involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to the original loan terms as of a specific date or the occurrence of an event , such as a failure to pay in accordance with the terms of the modification . typically , these modifications are for a period of up to 24 months after which the interest rate reverts to the original loan rate . a permanent modification , with a term greater than 60 months , is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed . permanent modifications primarily include the government-created home affordable modification program ( hamp ) or pnc-developed hamp-like modification programs . for consumer loan programs , such as residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines , we will enter into a temporary modification when the borrower has indicated a temporary hardship and a willingness to bring current the delinquent loan balance . examples of this situation often include delinquency due to illness or death in the family , or a loss of employment . permanent modifications are entered into when it is confirmed that the borrower does not possess the income necessary to continue making loan payments at the current amount , but our expectation is that payments at lower amounts can be made . residential mortgage and home equity loans and lines have been modified with changes in terms for up to 60 months , although the majority involve periods of three to 24 months . we also monitor the success rates and delinquency status of our loan modification programs to assess their effectiveness in serving our customers 2019 needs while mitigating credit losses . the following tables provide the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified consumer real estate related loans as well as the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified loans that were 60 days or more past due as of six months , nine months and twelve months after the

","The sum of the amortization amounts for each of the first five years is $45 * 5 = <<1*45*5>>225. Adding the amortization cost in 2019 ($44) results in a total cost of $225 + $44 = <<1+45*5+44>>229. Therefore, the answer to ""what is the total cost divided by 5?"" would be 229 / 5 = <<1+(45*5)+44)/5>>229 / 5 = 45.8. However, since we cannot have a fractional amount for the amortization cost per year, the actual answer should be rounded down to 45. Thus, the final answer is 45.",44.8,Yes

Question: during 2011, what percentage did the higher charges related to tobacco and health judgments represent in relation to the operating companies income increase?
Answer: 0.73109
Question: and what percentage did the cost reduction initiatives represent in relation to them?


[/INST]### Response:
","The text states that the operating companies income increased $119 million (2.1%) in 2012 compared to 2010, but it also mentions that there were higher charges related to tobacco and health judgments ($87 million) and FDA user fees ($73 million). Therefore, we can calculate the percentage of the operating companies income increase attributable to these charges by adding their amounts and dividing by the overall operating companies income increase:

($87 million + $73 million) / $119 million = 0.73109 or 73.11%

Regarding your second question, the text does mention cost reduction initiatives saving $198 million, so we can find out the percentage they represent in relation to the operating companies income increase by subtracting the amount spent on these initiatives from the overall operating companies income increase and then divide by the operating companies income increase:

$119 million - $198 million / $119 million = -0.41 or -41%. However, since negative percentages don't make sense, you should interpret this result as meaning that the cost reduction initiatives represented a decrease of 41% in the operating companies income increase.",1.66387,No

### Input:
when we purchase an asset , we capitalize all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use . however , many of our assets are self-constructed . a large portion of our capital expenditures is for track structure expansion ( capacity projects ) and replacement ( program projects ) , which is typically performed by our employees . approximately 13% ( 13 % ) of our full-time equivalent employees are dedicated to the construction of capital assets . costs that are directly attributable or overhead costs that relate directly to capital projects are capitalized . direct costs that are capitalized as part of self-constructed assets include material , labor , and work equipment . indirect costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset . these costs are allocated using appropriate statistical bases . the capitalization of indirect costs is consistent with fasb statement no . 67 , accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects . general and administrative expenditures are expensed as incurred . normal repairs and maintenance are also expensed as incurred , while costs incurred that extend the useful life of an asset , improve the safety of our operations or improve operating efficiency are capitalized . assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease . amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease . 10 . accounts payable and other current liabilities dec . 31 , dec . 31 , millions of dollars 2008 2007 . <table class='wikitable'><tr><td>1</td><td>millions of dollars</td><td>dec . 31 2008</td><td>dec . 31 2007</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>accounts payable</td><td>$ 629</td><td>$ 732</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>accrued wages and vacation</td><td>367</td><td>394</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>accrued casualty costs</td><td>390</td><td>371</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>income and other taxes</td><td>207</td><td>343</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>dividends and interest</td><td>328</td><td>284</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>equipment rents payable</td><td>93</td><td>103</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>other</td><td>546</td><td>675</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>total accounts payable and other current liabilities</td><td>$ 2560</td><td>$ 2902</td></tr></table> 11 . fair value measurements during the first quarter of 2008 , we fully adopted fasb statement no . 157 , fair value measurements ( fas 157 ) . fas 157 established a framework for measuring fair value and expanded disclosures about fair value measurements . the adoption of fas 157 had no impact on our financial position or results of operations . fas 157 applies to all assets and liabilities that are measured and reported on a fair value basis . this enables the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values . the statement requires that each asset and liability carried at fair value be classified into one of the following categories : level 1 : quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities . level 2 : observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data . level 3 : unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. .
Question: as of december 31, 2008, what was the amount of the accrued wages and vacation?
Answer: 367.0
Question: and what was the total of accounts payable and other current liabilities?
Answer: 2560.0
Question: what percentage, then, did that amount represent in relation to this total?
Answer: 0.14336
Question: and from 2007 to that year, what was the change in the total of equipment rents payable?
Answer: -10.0
Question: what is this change as a percentage of that total in 2007?


[/INST]### Response:
","The text states that the accrued wages and vacation were $367.0 million as of December 31, 2008. Therefore, the answer to the third question is ""367.0"".

Furthermore, the text also mentions that the total accounts payable and other current liabilities were $2,560.0 million as of December 31, 2008. So, the answer to the fourth question is ""2560.0"".

To find the percentage of accrued wages and vacation in relation to the total accounts payable and other current liabilities, divide the former by the latter: 367 / 2560 = 0.14336. Thus, the answer to the fifth question is ""0.14336"" or ""approximately 14.34%"".

Lastly, according to the table, the change in equipment rents payable between 2007 and 2008 was -$10.0 million. Hence, the answer to the sixth question is ""-10.0"". To calculate the percentage change, divide the difference (-10) by the original value (103): -10 / 103 = -0.0976. Multiplying this result by 100 gives us the final answer: ""-9.76%"".",-0.09709,Yes

Question: what is the weighted average cost per share in 2016?
Answer: 48.56
Question: what percentage change does this represent?


[/INST]### Response:
","The percentage change in the weighted average cost per share between 2016 and 2017 is calculated as follows:

Percentage Change = ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) x 100%

In this case, the new value is 63.84 and the old value is 48.56. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Percentage Change = ((63.84 - 48.56) / 48.56) x 100%
Percentage Change = (15.28 / 48.56) x 100%
Percentage Change ≈ 31.5%

Therefore, the percentage change in the weighted average cost per share between 2016 and 2017 is approximately 31.5%.",0.31466,Yes

Question: what was the percentage of sq ft of the office in alpharette, georgia not leased as of 12/31/13?


[/INST]### Response:
","The text states that 165,000 square feet of the office in Alpharetta, Georgia, is not leased out of a total of 254,000 square feet. To find the percentage of unleased space, you can divide the number of unleased square feet by the total square footage and multiply by 100%:

(Unleased Square Feet / Total Square Feet) * 100% = Percentage of Unleased Space

So, the calculation would look like this:

((165,000 / 254,000) * 100%) = Approx. 65.12%

Therefore, approximately 65.12% of the office in Alpharetta, Georgia, was not leased as of December 31, 2013.",0.64961,Yes

Question: what percentage was eurasia sbu of the total revenue in 2017?
Answer: 0.151
Question: at 12/31/17, with an average price per share of $12.12, what would be the cost to repurchase all the remaining shares in the program?


[/INST]### Response:
","To find the percentage of Eurasia SBU's revenue in the total revenue for the year 2017, you can use the value from the table:

Eurasia SBU's total revenue in 2017 = $1,590 million
Total revenue in 2017 = $10,530 million

Percentage of Eurasia SBU's revenue in the total revenue = ($1,590 million / $10,530 million) * 100%
= 0.151 or 15.1%

As for the second question, to calculate the cost to repurchase all the remaining shares in the program at an average price per share of $12.12, you need the total number of shares remaining for repurchase:

Remaining shares for repurchase = $246 million / Average price per share
= $246 million / $12.12
≈ 20,313 thousand shares

The cost to repurchase all these shares would then be:
Cost = Number of shares * Average price per share
= 20,313 thousand shares * $12.12
≈ $248.1 million",2981.52,No

Answer: 412.0
Question: what was the full total of notes payable?
Answer: 526.5
Question: how much, then, in relation to this total did that amount represent?


[/INST]### Response:
","The text does not provide enough information to directly calculate the total interest expense for the year ended May 27, 2012. However, it mentions that there were unrealized losses from interest rate cash flow hedges in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) of $73.6 million after tax. Since these losses will eventually be recognized in net interest, they can be considered part of the company's interest expense. Therefore, we need to add those losses to the net amount of pre-tax gains and losses expected to be reclassified into net earnings within the next 12 months ($14.0 million).

First, let's find the pretax figure:
Total unrealized losses = $73.6M + $1.7M = $75.3M
Since the tax rate isn't mentioned explicitly, we assume a 35% tax rate (the most common corporate tax rate):
Taxable losses = Total unrealized losses * (1 - Tax Rate)
                      = $75.3M * (1 - 0.35)
                      ≈ $50.1M
Now, subtract the tax savings to get the pretax figure:
Pretax losses = Taxable losses / (1 - Tax Rate)
                     = $50.1M / (1 - 0.35)
                     ≈ $76.4M
Adding the pretax gains and losses in AOCI:
Total pretax figures = Pretax losses + Net amount in AOCI
                             = $76.4M + $14.0M
                             ≈ $90.4M
To find the total interest expense, we need to consider the weighted-average interest rates given in the table. Let's denote the weights as w1, w2, and w3 for US Commercial Paper, Financial Institutions, and Total Notes Payable respectively. We don't know the exact values but since US Commercial Paper represents only 0.2% of the total, it's likely to have a smaller impact than the others. So, assuming w1 <<< w2 and w1 <<< w3, we can approximate the total interest expense as:

Total Interest Expense = Weighted Average Interest Rates * Total Notes Payable
                              ≈ 2.4% * $526.5M
                              ≈ $12.636M

So, the answer to the first question is: For the year ended on May 27, 2012, the total interest expense, in millions, was approximately $12.636.",0.78253,No

Answer: 593.7
Question: what is the number of shares in 2015?
Answer: 314.7
Question: what is the sum including all 3 years?


[/INST]### Response:
","The sum of the weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations in 2017 and 2016 can be found by adding the values given in the table for those years: 290.6 + 303.1 = 593.7

Therefore, the answer to the first question is 593.7.

As for the second question, the number of shares in 2015 is stated as 314.7 in the text provided.

So, the answer to the second question is 314.7.

Finally, to find the sum of the weighted average common shares outstanding for all three years, you would add the values for 2017, 2016, and 2015: 287.8 + 290.6 + 314.7 = 993.1. However, since the question only asked for the sum of the weights averages for diluted computations in 2017 and 2016, the final answer is 593.7.",908.4,No

Question: what percentage of the total dividend in 2019 is from the first quarter?
Answer: 0.24017
Question: and what percentage of the total dividend in 2018 is from the first quarter?


[/INST]### Response:
","To find the percentage of the total dividend in 2019 that comes from the first quarter, you can use the following formula:

Percentage = (Dividend Amount for First Quarter / Total Dividend Amount) * 100%

Using the given data, the calculations would look like this:

For 2019: Percentage = ($1.10 / $4.58) * 100% = 0.24017 or 24.02%

Similarly, for 2018: Percentage = ($0.95 / $4.25) * 100% = 0.22432 or 22.43%

Therefore, the answers to the questions are:

Answer: The percentage of the total dividend in 2019 that is from the first quarter is 24.017%, or approximately 24.02%.
Answer: And the percentage of the total dividend in 2018 that is from the first quarter is 22.43%.",0.22353,Yes

decided to pursue a strategic shift of its distribution companies in brazil , aes sul and eletropaulo . the disposal of sul was completed in october 2016 . in december 2016 , eletropaulo underwent a corporate restructuring which is expected to , among other things , provide more liquidity of its shares . aes is continuing to pursue strategic options for eletropaulo in order to complete its strategic shift to reduce aes 2019 exposure to the brazilian distribution business , including preparation for listing its shares into the novo mercado , which is a listing segment of the brazilian stock exchange with the highest standards of corporate governance . the company executed an agreement for the sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary aes sul in june 2016 . we have reported the results of operations and financial position of aes sul as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented . upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria , the company recognized an after tax loss of $ 382 million comprised of a pretax impairment charge of $ 783 million , offset by a tax benefit of $ 266 million related to the impairment of the sul long lived assets and a tax benefit of $ 135 million for deferred taxes related to the investment in aes sul . prior to the impairment charge in the second quarter , the carrying value of the aes sul asset group of $ 1.6 billion was greater than its approximate fair value less costs to sell . however , the impairment charge was limited to the carrying value of the long lived assets of the aes sul disposal group . on october 31 , 2016 , the company completed the sale of aes sul and received final proceeds less costs to sell of $ 484 million , excluding contingent consideration . upon disposal of aes sul , we incurred an additional after- tax loss on sale of $ 737 million . the cumulative impact to earnings of the impairment and loss on sale was $ 1.1 billion . this includes the reclassification of approximately $ 1 billion of cumulative translation losses , resulting in a net reduction to the company 2019s stockholders 2019 equity of $ 92 million . sul 2019s pretax loss attributable to aes for the years ended december 31 , 2016 and 2015 was $ 1.4 billion and $ 32 million , respectively . sul 2019s pretax gain attributable to aes for the year ended december 31 , 2014 was $ 133 million . prior to its classification as discontinued operations , sul was reported in the brazil sbu reportable segment . as discussed in note 1 2014general and summary of significant accounting policies , effective july 1 , 2014 , the company prospectively adopted asu no . 2014-08 . discontinued operations prior to adoption of asu no . 2014-08 include the results of cameroon , saurashtra and various

Question: what is the net change in the price of the nasdaq composite from 2008 to 2012?


[/INST]### Response:
","The net change in the price of the Nasdaq Composite Index from 2008 to 2012 can be calculated by subtracting its value at the end of 2007 from its value at the end of 2012 as shown below:

Net Change = Value at End of Period - Value at Beginning of Period

From the given table, we have the values for the Nasdaq Composite Index as follows:

Value at Beginning of Period: 100.00 (December 29, 2007)
Value at End of Period: 110.78 (December 29, 2012)

Substituting these values into the formula above, we get:

Net Change = 110.78 - 100.00 = 10.78

Therefore, the net change in the price of the Nasdaq Composite Index from 2008 to 2012 is 10.78.",10.78,Yes

Question: what was the percentage of impairment charges to net revenue in 2013?


[/INST]### Response:
","The percentage of impairment charges to net revenue in 2013 was approximately 4.2%. To find this, you can divide the impairment charges ($240 million) by the net revenue ($52,708 million). Impairment charges = $240,000,000 / Net Revenue = $240,000,000 / $52,708,000,000 = 0.0455 or 4.55%, then rounding up to get 4.6%.

Answer: 200247.0
Question: what was, then, the combined total for the two years?
Answer: 428928.0
Question: including 2016, what then becomes this total?
Answer: 665598.0
Question: and what was the average between the three years?


[/INST]### Response:
","The average of the AFS investment securities for the three years is calculated as follows:

(Total of AFS investment securities for all three years) / (Number of years)

First, we find the sum of AFS investment securities for each year from the text and table:

* From the text: ""afs investment securities (period-end): 228681.0"" for 2018
* From the table: ""afs investment securities (period-end): 200247.0"" for 2017

Adding these values together, we get:

228681 + 200247 = 428928

Now, to calculate the average, divide the total by the number of years:

Average = 428928 / 3 = 142976.0

So, the answer is 142976.0 million dollars.",221866.0,No

Question: what was, in millions, the total of future minimum lease commitments at december 31 , 2006 for all operating leases that have a remaining term of more than one year?
Answer: 1100.0
Question: and how much do the future lease commitments that are due in 2008 represent in relation to this total, in percentage?


[/INST]### Response:
","The future minimum lease commitments for all operating leases that have a remaining term of over one year amounted to $1.1 billion according to the text. In 2008, the future lease commitment was $121 million. To find out what proportion of the total future lease commitments this represents, you can calculate:

($121 million / $1.1 billion) * 100% = 11.09%

So, approximately 11.09% of the total future lease commitments at December 31, 2006, were due in 2008.",0.23091,No

Question: what is the number of shares in 2015?
Answer: 314.7
Question: what is the sum including all 3 years?
Answer: 908.4
Question: what is that sum divided by 3?


[/INST]### Response:
","The sum of the weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations in 2017 and 2016 is 593.7 (from the previous answer) + 303.1 (from the given text) = 896.8. However, since I made an error in my initial calculation, the correct answer for the sum of the weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations in 2017 and 2016 is actually 593.7 (from the first question) + 290.6 (from the given text) = 884.3. Therefore, the final answer should be 884.3 instead of 896.8.

Regarding your second question, the number of shares in 2015 was 314.7, according to the given text.

Finally, the sum of the weighted average common shares outstanding for all three years is 287.8 (from the given text for 2017) + 299.3 (from the given text for 2016) + 314.7 (from the given text for 2015) = 908.4.

[/INST]### Response:
","The text indicates that the last year included in the remaining terms of the facility leases is 2010. Therefore, the first year in this period would be 2004 since we are counting forward from the current date (March 31, 2004). This period covers six years, so the total remaining obligation in all of these years can be calculated by multiplying the annual rent amount by the number of years. From the given information, the annual rent expense for the facility leases was approximately $821,000 in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004.

[/INST]### Response:
","The change in fair value over the year was 17951.0. To find the percentage representation of this change relative to the 2010 fair value, you can use the formula:

Percentage Change = ((Change / Fair Value in Previous Year) * 100%)

Plugging in the values:

Percentage Change = ((17951.0 / 81881.0) * 100%)

Calculating the percentage change:
