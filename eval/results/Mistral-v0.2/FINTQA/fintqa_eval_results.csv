q0: what was the change in the unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the senior notes between 2016 and 2017? {answer0}
Question: so what was the percentage change during this time?
Answer:","To find the percentage change in the unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the senior notes between 2016 and 2017, we first need to determine the difference in dollars, then calculate the percentage of the initial value.

From the text provided, we have the following values:
- Unamortized debt issuance costs associated with senior notes as of December 31, 2017: $8 million
- Unamortized debt issuance costs associated with senior notes as of December 31, 2016: $15 million

The difference between the two values is: $7 million ($15M - $8M)

To find the percentage change, divide the difference by the initial value and multiply by 100%.
Percentage Change = ((Difference / Initial Value) * 100%)
= (($7M / $15M) * 100%)
≈ (-46.67%)

So, there was an approximate decrease of 46.67% in the unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the senior notes between 2016 and 2017.",-0.21053,0

q0: what is the ratio of discretionary company contributions to total expensed amounts for savings plans in 2009? {answer0}
Question: what is that times 100?
Answer:","To find the ratio of discretionary company contributions to total expenses for savings plans in 2009, you can use the given information about the expenses and the discretionary company contributions. The discrepancy between the reported expenses and the sum of employee contributions and company matching contributions gives us the discretionary company contributions.

First, let's calculate the total expenses for savings plans in 2009:
Total expenses = Employee contributions + Company matching contributions
Total expenses = $35.1 + ($3.8 * Number_of_employees)

To determine the number of employees, divide the employee contributions by the average employee contribution:
Number_of_employees = Employee_contributions / Average_employee_contribution

Assuming the average employee contribution remains constant at $31.4, we can calculate the number of employees:
Number_of_employees = $35.1 / $31.4 ≈ 11.2

Now, we can calculate the total expenses:
Total expenses = $35.1 + ($3.8 * 11.2) ≈ $43.2

Next, we need to find the discretionary company contributions:
Discretionary_company_contributions = Total_expenses - Employee_contributions - Matching_contributions
Discretionary_company_contributions = $43.2 - $35.1 - ($3.8 * 11.2) ≈ $3.9

Finally, to get the ratio of discretionary company contributions to total expenses, divide the discretionary company contributions by the total expenses:
Ratio = Discretionary_company_contributions / Total_expenses ≈ $3.9 / $43.2 ≈ 0.0875

Multiplying the ratio by 100 to obtain a percentage, we get approximately 8.75%.",10.82621,0

Question: how much did the gallons hedged in 2018 represent in relation to the ones hedged in 2017?
Answer:","The text states that 3,000,000 gallons were hedged in 2018 and 12,000,000 gallons were hedged in 2017. To find the relative representation of gallons hedged in 2018 compared to 2017, divide the number of gallons hedged in 2018 by the number of gallons hedged in 2017 and multiply by 100 to get percentage.

Calculation: (3,000,000 / 12,000,000) x 100% = 25%

So, 25% of the gallons hedged in 2018 were in comparison to the ones hedged in 2017.",4.0,0

Question: how much, then, did the 2016 fair value represent in relation to this 2015 one?
Answer:","To find the ratio of the 2018 gallons hedged to that of 2017, we can look up the numbers from the provided table:

<tr><td>Year</td><td>Gallons Hedged</td></tr>
<tr><td>2017</td><td>12,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>2018</td><td>3,000,000</td></tr>

The ratio of gallons hedged in 2018 compared to 2017 is:

3,000,000 / 12,000,000 = 0.25
```
So, the answer to Q0 is ""the 2018 gallons represented approximately 25% of the gallons hedged in 2017.""

To determine the relationship between the 2016 and 2015 fair values, we need to find their respective amounts first:

From the text:
- The aggregate fair values of outstanding fuel hedges in 2016 and 2015 were $2.7M and $37.8M, respectively.

Therefore, the answer to Q1 is ""$37.8M"" and the answer to Q2 is ""$37.8M"".

Now, let's calculate the ratio of the 2016 fair value to the 2015 fair value:
```makefile
$2.7M / $37.8M = 0.0741

q0: what was the total african and us net undeveloped acres expiring in 2016? {answer0}
Question: what percentage of undeveloped acres were in the us in 2018?
Answer:","To find the percentage of undeveloped acres that were in the US in 2018, you need to use the data provided in the text and the table. First, calculate the total net undeveloped acres expiring in 2018 by adding up the values in the last column of the table (for ""Total"" and for ""Other International""). Then, subtract those values from the total net undevelved acres expiring in 2018 as shown in the table (the value under ""Total"" in the last row). Next, divide the net undeveloped acres expiring in 2018 for the US (as shown in the second row) by the total net undeveloped acres expiring in 2018 and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

Here are the calculations step-by-step:

1. Find the total net undeveloped acres expiring in 2018: 1018 + 2014 = 1222
2. Subtract the total net undeveloped acres expiring in 2018 for Africa and Other International: 1222 - (4533 + 2014) = 1222 - 4747 = -3525
This result indicates an error since the number cannot be negative. It seems there might be a mistake in the data presented. The correct calculation should give a positive value.

To address the initial question, the total African and US net undeveloped acres expiring in 2016 can be found directly from the table:

For US: 68 + 89 + 128 = 285
For Africa: 189 + 4352 + 854 = 4611
So, the total African and US net undeveloped acres expiring in 2016 is 285 (US) + 4611 (Africa) = 4639.",0.12574,0

Question: so what was the percentage change during this time?
Answer:","To calculate the percentage change in cash provided by operating activities between 2012 and 2013, you can use the following formula:

Percentage Change = ((Value2 - Value1) / Value1) * 100%

First, find the values for q0 and q1:

{answer0} = $369 million
{answer1} = $6161 million

Next, calculate the difference between the two years:

{answer2} = ($6161 - $369) = $5822 million

Now, calculate the percentage change:

{answer} = ((5822 / 6161) * 100%) = 94.83%

So, the percentage change in cash provided by operating activities between 2012 and 2013 is approximately 94.83%.",0.10745,0

Question: what is the product of the change by the quotient?
Answer:","To find the product of the change in the S&P 500 between 2015 and 2016 and the quotient of 100,000 divided by 100, first you need to determine the change in the S&P 500 index during that period. From the table provided, the S&P 500 value was 113.64 at the end of 2015 and 150.33 at the end of 2016. Therefore, the change in the S&P 500 index between these two years is 36.69 ($150.33 - $113.64).

Next, calculate the quotient of 100,000 divided by 100: 100,000 / 100 = 1,000.

Finally, multiply the change in the S&P 500 index with the quotient: 36.69 × 1,000 = 36,690. Answer: The product of the change and the quotient is 36,690.",18770.0,0

Question: what is the ratio of fair value to carrying value?
Answer:","To calculate the ratio of fair value to carrying value, we need to divide the fair value by the carrying value for each type of borrowing and then take the average of those ratios.

First, let's find the fair value to carrying value ratios for each type of borrowing:

1. Long-term borrowings:
   The total fair value of long-term borrowings ($5,309 million) divided by their carrying value ($4,938 million):
   5,309 / 4,938 = 1.074

2. 2024 Notes:
   The fair value of the 2024 notes ($1,029 million) divided by their carrying value ($997 million):
   1,029 / 997 = 1.037

Now, let's find the average of these ratios:
(1.074 + 1.037)/2 = 1.055

So, the ratio of fair value to carrying value across all types of borrowings is approximately 1.055.",1.07513,1

q0: what is the ratio of fair value to carrying value? {answer0}
Question: what is that less 1?
Answer:","The ratio of fair value to carrying value for all long-term borrowings combined was 5.309 / 4.938 = 1.075 at December 31, 2014. Therefore, the difference between the fair value and carrying value is 1.075 * $4,938M - $4,938M = $5,309M - $4,938M = $361M. So, the answer to ""what is that less 1?"" would be $361M.",0.07513,0

Question: and in the previous year, what was the decline in the net earnings, also in millions?
Answer:","The decline in net earnings in the previous year (2016) was $932 million or 13.4%. Therefore, the net earnings attributable to PMI in 2016 were ($6.0 billion - $932 million) = $5.07 billion. To find the operating income for 2016, subtract cost of sales, marketing, administration and research costs, and interest expense, net from net earnings:

Operating Income (2016) = Net Earnings Attributable to PMI (2016) - Cost of Sales (2016) - Marketing Administration and Research Costs (2016) - Interest Expense, net (2016)
= $5.07 billion - $9.391 billion - $6.405 billion - $914 million

Question: what is that as a percentage of the 2015 net earnings?
Answer:","To calculate the percentage change in net earnings between 2016 and 2017 relative to the 2015 net earnings, you would first need to determine the absolute value of the change in net earnings between those two years. From the text provided, we can find the following information:

Net Earnings (excluding excise taxes) for RRPs in 2015: $X
Net Earnings (excluding excise taxes) for RRPs in 2016: $Y = $733 million
Net Earnings (excluding excise taxes) for RRPs in 2017: $Z = $3.6 billion

Change in Net Earnings (excluding excise taxes) for RRPs between 2016 and 2017: $W = Z - Y = $3.267 billion ($3.6B - $733M)

From the text, we do not have access to the exact values of X or the total net earnings for PMI in 2015. However, we know that the net earnings attributable to PMI in 2017 were $6.0 billion and decreased by $932 million compared to 2016. Therefore, we can use this information to calculate the percentage change in net earnings between 2016 and 2017 relative to the 2015 net earnings:

Percentage Change = ((W / |X|) * 100%)

Since we don't have the actual values of X, we cannot provide a definitive answer. We recommend revisiting the text to obtain the necessary information about the 2015 net earnings before attempting to calculate the percentage change.",0.134,0

Question: what, then, can be concluded to have been those 2015 earnings, in millions?
Answer:","To find the 2015 net earnings mentioned in question ""q3"" and ""q4"", we need to first determine the net earnings before the fluctuations in excise taxes and exchange rates. We know that net revenues from RRPs without excise taxes were $3.6B in 2017 and $733M in 2016. Let's assume the net margins (excluding excise taxes) remained constant between 2015 and 2017. In such case, the net earnings before excise taxes and other factors in 2015 would be:

Net Earnings Before Excise Taxes (2015): = Net Revenues Without Excise Taxes (2015) * Net Margin (Excluding Excise Taxes)
= ($3.6B - $733M) / (1 - Cost Of Sales Percentage + Marketing Administration And Research Costs Percentage + Operating Income Percentage)

Using the given information, let's calculate the net earnings before excise taxes and other factors in 2015:

Cost Of Sales Percentage: 11.1%
Marketing Administration And Research Costs Percentage: 5.0%
Operating Income Percentage: 6.4%

Net Earnings Before Excise Taxes (2015): = ($3.6B - $733M) / (1 - 0.111 - 0.050 - 0.064)
≈ $4.5B

Now, let's check if this value matches the reported net earnings in 2015. Unfortunately, no specific figure has been provided for the net earnings in 2015. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude the exact amount of the net earnings in 2015. However, we now have enough context to understand how the figures relate to each other.",6955.22388,0

Question: and what is that in billions?
Answer:","To find the answer in billions, you need to convert all the given numbers into billions before performing calculations. Here's how you can do it:

First, let's calculate the values mentioned in millions and convert them into billions:

1. Net Revenues: In 2017, net revenues were $3,800 million (without excise taxes) + $0.9 billion (excise taxes) = $4,790 million. In 2016, net revenues were $3,600 million (without excise taxes) + $733 million (excise taxes) = $4,333 million.
2. Cost of Sales: In 2017, cost of sales was $10,432 million; in 2016, it was $9,391 million.
3. Marketing Administration and Research Costs: In 2017, these costs were $6,725 million; in 2016, they were $6,405 million.
4. Operating Income: In 2017, operating income was $11,503 million; in 2016, it was $10,815 million.
5. Interest Expense, net: In 2017, interest expense, net, was $914 million; in 2016, it was $891 million.

Now, let's answer the original question:

Q: What was the change in net earnings between 2017 and 2016, in billions?
A: The change in net earnings between 2017 and 2016 was -$932 million or -$0.932 billion.",6.95522,0
