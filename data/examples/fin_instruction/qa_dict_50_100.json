It has enhanced its oversight of ESG matters, with a dedicated agenda item on this topic introduced for 2022. It considered ESG at seven meetings during the year. – Board members receive ESG-related training as part of their induction and ongoing development, and seek out further opportunities to build their skills and experience in this area. Sub-committee accountability, processes and frequency – The Group Risk Committee (‘GRC’) maintains oversight of delivery plans to ensure that the Group develops robust climate risk management capabilities. The GRC also has oversight over ESG-related initiatives and reviews these to assess the risk profile. It considered ESG risk at four meetings in 2022. – The Group Audit Committee (‘GAC’) reviews and challenges ESG and climate-related reporting, processes, systems and controls and considered these matters in detail at five meetings during the year. The GAC, supported by the executive-level ESG Committee and Group Disclosure and Controls Committee, provided close oversight of the disclosure risks in relation to ESG and climate reporting, amid rising stakeholder expectations. Examples of the Board and relevant Board committees taking climate into account – The Board considered whether to establish a Board committee dedicated to ESG issues, but instead decided that the best way to support the oversight and delivery of the Group’s climate ambition and ESG strategy was to retain governance at Board level. – In 2022, the Board oversaw the implementation of ESG strategy through regular dashboard reports and detailed updates including: reviews of net zero policies, financed emissions target setting and climate-aligned financing initiatives. – The Group Chairman and the Group Chief Executive met regularly with government officials globally to continue to foster strong international relations. In addition, certain Board members also continued to be actively involved in climate initiatives and attend global events such as the Group Chief Executive’s attendance at the COP27 Summit in Egypt."

These support senior management in the delivery of the Group’s ESG strategy, key policies and material commitments by providing oversight over – and management and coordination of – ESG commitments and activities. – The Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer, and Group Chief Sustainability Officer hold joint responsibility for the ESG Committee. It oversees all areas of environmental, social and governance issues, with support from accountable senior management in relation to their particular areas of responsibilities. Key representatives from the functions and global businesses attend to provide insights on the implementation of the ESG strategy across the Group, allowing the ESG Committee to make recommendations to the Board in respect of ESG matters. – The Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer and the chief risk officers of our PRA-regulated businesses are the senior managers responsible for climate financial risks under the UK Senior Managers Regime. How management reports to the Board – The Board delegates day-to-day management of the business and implementation of strategy to the Group Chief Executive. The Group Chief Executive is supported in his management of the Group by recommendations and advice from the Group Executive Committee (’GEC’), an executive forum comprising members of senior management that include chief executive officers of the global businesses, regional chief executive officers and functional heads. – Key representatives from the functions and global businesses attend the ESG Committee to provide insights on the implementation of the ESG strategy across the Group, allowing the ESG Committee to make recommendations to the Board in respect of ESG matters.Processes used to inform management – The ESG Committee supports Group executives in the development and delivery of ESG strategy, key policies and material commitments by providing oversight, coordination and management of ESG commitments and activities. We also recognise that we require enhanced capabilities and new sources of data. – The Climate Risk Oversight Forum oversees all global risk activities relating to climate risk management, including physical and transition risks. Equivalent forums have been established at regional level. – The Sustainability Target Operating Model Steering Committee oversees the implementation of the Group’s organisational plan for the internal infrastructure, both within the Sustainability function and the wider Group, to help deliver our climate ambitions."

                    "A": "Processes used to determine material risks and opportunities – To support the requirements for assessing the impacts of climate change, we have developed a set of capabilities to execute climate stress testing and scenario analysis. These are used to improve our understanding of our risk exposures for risk management and business decision making. Given the challenges on data sourcing and processes, there has been an impact on certain climate disclosures. – Climate scenario analysis was used as a risk assessment tool to provide insights on the long-term effects of transition and physical risks across our corporate and retail banking portfolios, as well as our own operations. – Our sustainable finance ambition has enabled sustainable infrastructure and energy systems, promoted decarbonisation efforts across the real economy, and enhanced investor capital through sustainable investment. Relevant short, medium, and long term time horizons – We aim to achieve net zero in our financed emissions by 2050, and in our own operations and supply chain by 2030. – We aim to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn of sustainable finance and investment for our customers in their transition to net zero and a sustainable future. – We have taken these time horizons into our consideration. Our assessment of climate risks covers three distinct time periods: short term is up to 2025, medium term is 2026 to 2035; and long term is 2036 to 2050. Transition or physical climate-related issues identified – We enhanced our transition and physical risk questionnaire and scoring tool, which helps us to assess and improve our understanding of the impact of transition and physical risk on our customers’ business models, and used it for our corporate clients in high climate transition risk sectors. – We are supporting our customers in their transition through our sustainable finance and investment ambition. Our sustainable finance data dictionary includes a detailed definition of contributing activities. – In the UK, in line with our retail portfolio, the main perils that drive potential credit losses relate to coastal, river and surface water flooding, although the impacts from these perils are not expected to cause significant damages. Around 20% of our financed properties are in London, and most are protected by the Thames Barrier. Risks and opportunities by sector and/or geography – We identified six key sectors where our wholesale credit customers have the highest exposure to climate transition risk, based on their carbon emissions. These are automotive, chemicals, construction and building materials, metals and mining, oil and gas, and power and utilities. – We continued to improve our identification and assessment of climate risk within our retail mortgage portfolio, with increased investments in physical risk data and enhancements to our internal risk assessment capabilities and models. We completed detailed analysis for the UK, Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia, which together represent 73.8% of balances of the global mortgage portfolio. – Opportunities include sustainable finance, sustainable investment and sustainable infrastructure. For a detailed breakdown of our sustainable finance progress by geography, see the ESG Data Pack. Concentrations of credit exposure to carbon-related assets (supplemental guidance for banks) – We report our exposure to the six high transition risk sectors in the wholesale portfolio. For details, see the ESG Data Pack. – Since 2020, we have rolled out the questionnaire so that it included our largest customers in the next highest climate transition risk sectors: agriculture, industrials, real estate, and transportation. This was done across a larger geographical scope. Climate-related risks (transition and physical) in lending and other financial intermediary business activities (supplemental guidance for banks) – As a result of our climate scenario analysis, our largest and most impacted sectors – power and utilities, construction and building materials, and chemicals – are subject to increased levels of transition risks due to their ongoing exposure to higher carbon-emitting activities. – HSBC Asset Management is increasingly considering both physical and transition risks. As a result, it integrated ESG and climate analysis to help ensure that risks faced by companies are considered throughout the investment decision-making process.Impact on strategy, business, and financial planning – Transition to net zero represents one of our four strategic pillars. We aim to be net zero in our operations and supply chain by 2030 and in our financed emissions by 2050. – Scenario analysis supports our strategy by assessing our position under a range of climate scenarios. It helps to build our awareness of climate change, plan for the future and meet our growing regulatory requirements. We acknowledge that our systems, processes, controls and governance are developing. – We continue to develop how we produce our climate scenario analysis exercises so that we can have a more comprehensive understanding of climate headwinds, risks and opportunities that will support our strategic planning and actions. – We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of climate-related issues on financial planning, and particularly the impact of climate-related issues on our financial performance and financial position. In addition, we have considered the impact of climate-related issues on our businesses, strategy, and financial planning, but not specifically in relation to acquisitions/divestments. Due to transitional challenges such as process limitations, we do not disclose the climate-related impact in these areas. We expect to further enhance our disclosure and processes in relation to acquisitions/divestments in the medium term. – We have considered the impact of climate-related issues on our businesses, strategy, and financial planning. Our access to capital may be impacted by reputational concerns as a result of climate action or inaction. In addition, if we are perceived to mislead stakeholders on our business activities or if we fail to achieve our stated net zero ambitions, we could face greenwashing risk resulting in significant reputational damage, impacting our revenue generating ability and potentially our access to capital. Impact on products and services – We aim to help our customers’ transition to net zero and a sustainable future through providing and facilitating between $750bn and $1tn of sustainable finance and investment by 2030. Impact on supply chain and/or value chain – We will continue to engage with our supply chain through CDP, and through direct discussions with our suppliers on how they can further support our transition to net zero. – We also have significant responsibilities in relation to asset ownership by our insurance business, employee pension plans and asset management business. Impact on adaptation and mitigation activities – In October 2020, we announced our ambition to reduce our energy consumption by 50% by 2030, against a 2019 baseline. As part of our ambition to achieve 100% renewable power across our operations by 2030, we continue to look for opportunities to procure green energy in each of our markets. A key challenge remains the limited opportunity to pursue power purchase agreements or green tariffs in key markets due to regulations. Impact on operations – Climate change poses a physical risk to the buildings that we occupy as an organisation, including our offices, retail branches and data centres. – We use stress testing to evaluate the potential for impact to our owned or leased premises. Our scenario stress test, conducted in 2022, analysed how seven different climate change-related hazards – comprising coastal inundation, extreme heat, extreme winds, wildfires, riverine flooding, soil movement due to drought, and surface water flooding – could impact 500 of our critical and important buildings. Impact on investment in research and development – Our Climate Solutions Partnership is a five-year $100m philanthropic initiative that aims to identify and remove barriers to scale for climate change solutions. Working with the World Resources Institute, WWF and over 50 local partners, our support focuses on start-up companies developing carbon-cutting technologies, nature-based solutions, renewable energy initiatives in Asia and the WWF-led Asia Sustainable Palm Oil Links programme. How we are striving to meet investor expectations – During Board meetings, the Directors continued to balance discussions on the Group’s performance, emerging risks and duties to shareholders, while remaining conscious of responsibilities to support communities and help customers. – In 2022, the Board approved an update to the thermal coal phase-out policy. It also approved the publication of an updated energy policy. Transition plan to a low-carbon economy – We have committed to publish our own climate transition plan in 2023. This plan will outline, in one place, not only our commitments, targets and approach to net zero across the sectors and markets we serve, but how we are transforming our organisation to embed net zero and finance the transition."

                    "A": "Embedding climate into scenario analysis – Scenario analysis supports our strategy by assessing our position under a range of climate scenarios. It helps to build our awareness of climate change, plan for the future and meet our growing regulatory requirements. – In 2022, we delivered our first internal climate scenario analysis exercise where we used four scenarios that were designed to articulate our view of the range of potential outcomes for global climate change. The analysis considered the key regions in which we operate, and assessed the impact on our balance sheet between the 2022 and 2050 time period. Key drivers of performance and how these have been taken into account – Climate scenario analysis allows us to model how different potential climate pathways may affect our customers and portfolios, particularly in respect of credit losses. Under the Current Commitments scenario, we expect moderate levels of losses relating to transition risks. However, the rise in global warming will lead to increasing levels of physical risk losses in later years.Scenarios used and how they factored in government policies – The scenario assumptions used for our climate stress testing exercise include varying levels of governmental climate policy changes, macroeconomic factors and technological developments. However, these scenarios rely on the development of technologies that are still unproven, such as global hydrogen production to decarbonise aviation and shipping. For details of the assumptions, see the ESG Data Pack. How our strategies may change and adapt – The nature of the scenarios, our developing capabilities, and limitations of the analysis lead to outcomes that are indicative of climate change headwinds, although they are not a direct forecast. – Developments in climate science, data, methodology, and scenario analysis techniques will help us shape our approach further. We therefore expect this view of risk to change over time. – We plan to continue to enhance our capabilities for climate scenario analysis and use the results for decision making, particularly in respect of strategy, by using the range of scenario analysis outcomes to shape our strategy across business and regions. – We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of transition and physical risk quantitatively, due to transitional challenges including data limitations and evolving science and methodologies."

                    "A": "Traditional banking risk types considered – Our initial approach to managing climate risk was focused on understanding physical and transition impacts across five priority risk types: wholesale credit risk, retail credit risk, reputational risk, resilience risk and regulatory compliance risk. Process – We have integrated climate risk into our existing risk taxonomy, and incorporated it within the risk management framework through the policies and controls for the existing risks where appropriate. We also recognise that we require enhanced capabilities and new sources of data. – We consider greenwashing to be an important emerging risk that is likely to increase over time, as we look to develop capabilities and products to achieve our net zero commitments, and work with our clients to help them transition to a low-carbon economy. We also recognise that green finance taxonomies are not consistent globally, and evolving taxonomies and practices could result in revisions in our sustainable finance reporting going forward. – We also use stress testing and scenario analysis to assess how these climate risks will impact our customers, business and infrastructure. Integration into policies and procedures – In 2022, we incorporated climate considerations into our UK mortgage origination process for our retail mortgage business and new money request process for our key wholesale businesses. We also continued to enhance our climate risk scoring tool, which will enable us to assess our customers’ exposures to climate risk. We also published our updated energy policy, covering the oil and gas, power and utilities, hydrogen, renewables, nuclear and biomass sectors, as well as updated our thermal coal phase-out policy after its initial publication in 2021. – We are integrating climate risk into the policies, processes and controls across many areas of our organisation, and we will continue to update these as our climate risk management capabilities mature over time. Consider climate-related risks in traditional banking industry risk categories (supplementary guidance for banks) – In 2022, we expanded our scope to consider climate risk impacts on our other risk types (including treasury risk and traded risk) in our risk taxonomy. – We also analysed in our internal scenario analysis exercise how climate risks impact how we manage other risks within our organisation, including credit risk, and on an exploratory basis: market, operational, liquidity, insurance, and pension risks."

The wholesale loan exposure is used as a metric to assess impact of climate risk and help inform risk management, together with our transition risk questionnaire results. – We continue to measure climate risk in our most material mortgage market, which is the UK, where the primary physical risk facing properties is flooding. We also continue to identify the current and potential EPC ratings for individual properties within the UK mortgage portfolio. For further details, see our ESG Data Pack. – Our climate risk management information dashboard includes metrics relating to our key climate risks, and is reported to the Global Climate Risk Oversight Forum. However, we do not fully disclose metrics used to assess the impact of climate-related risks on retail lending, parts of wholesale lending and other financial intermediary business activities. Metrics used to assess progress against opportunities – We continue to track our progress against our ambition to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn of sustainable finance and investment by 2030, aligned to our published data dictionary. The breakdown of our sustainable finance and investment progress is included in our ESG Data Pack. – We do not currently fully disclose the proportion of revenue or proportion of assets, capital deployment or other business activities aligned with climate-related opportunities, including revenue from products and services designed for a low-carbon economy, forward-looking metrics consistent with our business or strategic planning time horizons. In addition, we do not currently disclose internal carbon prices due to transitional challenges such as data challenges. We recognise that we require enhanced systems, processes, controls, governance and new sources of data. Board or senior management incentives – To help us achieve our ESG ambitions, a number of measures are included in the annual incentive and long-term incentive scorecards of the Group Chief Executive, Group Chief Financial Officer and Group Executives. Metrics used to assess the impact of climate risk on lending and financial intermediary business (supplemental guidance for banks) – As part of our internal climate scenario analysis, we carried out a detailed physical risk assessment of four of our most material retail mortgage markets – the UK, Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia – which represent 73.8% of balances in our retail mortgage portfolio. In 2022, we disclose our loan maturity within the UK mortgage portfolio. – We do not fully disclose metrics used to assess the impact of climate-related risks on retail lending, parts of wholesale lending and other financial intermediary business activities (specifically credit exposure, equity and debt holdings, or trading positions, each broken down by industry, geography, credit quality, average tenor)."

To support our ambition to align our financed emissions to achieve net zero by 2050 or sooner, we have set interim 2030 targets for on-balance sheet financed emissions for eight sectors. – For financed emissions we do not plan to set 2025 targets. We set targets in line with the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (‘NZBA‘) guidelines by setting 2030 targets. In 2022, we disclose interim 2030 targets for on-balance sheet financed emissions for eight sectors. – We do not currently disclose targets used to measure and manage physical risk, or internal carbon price targets. This is due to transitional challenges and data limitations. But we considered physical risk and carbon prices as an input in the climate scenario analysis exercise. We expect to further enhance the disclosure in the medium term as more data becomes available. In addition, we do not currently disclose a target for capital deployment. In 2022, we are internally reviewing and enhancing the green bond framework, with further refinement to be undertaken in 2023. Our continued monitoring of evolving taxonomies and practices over time could result in revisions in our reporting going forward and lead to differences year-on-year as compared with prior years. We do not consider water usage to be a material target for our business and therefore we have not included a target in this year’s disclosure.

In 2022, TSMC added one transition risk (renewable energy regulations and procurement) and one opportunity (improve company reputation) and removed one physical risk (higher natural disaster insurance premium). The top three risks are net zero emissions, impact on company reputation, and uncertainties in the development of new energy saving/carbon reduction technologies. The top three opportunities are developing lowcarbon products and services/increasing energy efficiency in customer products, driving low-carbon manufacturing, and improving company reputation. Transition risks such as Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) commitment and company reputation were previously short-term and mid-term risks, but have now been changed to mid-term and long-term risks, respectively. Opportunities such as increasing fab energy efficiency, promoting low-carbon green manufacturing were modified from short-term to mid-term."

                    "A": "TSMC conducts financial impact analysis on the top three physical risks, transition risks, and climate opportunities in compliance with TCFD recommendations to formulate strategies to mitigate risks and explore opportunities for the Company's reference. Financial impact analysis of climaterelated risks focuses mainly on marketand technology-related costs to remove carbon emissions along the pathway to Net Zero Emissions by 2050. For example, expenses on energy conservation or carbon reduction facilities, paying for more expensive renewable energy or RECs, buying carbon credits, and additional expenses on renewable energy or carbon credits because of uncertainties in the development of new energy saving and carbon reduction technologies. Physical risks mainly focus on growing electricity costs because of chronic climate changes from rising temperatures and investments in strengthening the Company's climate resilience. For example, the costs to combat drought include expenses for building water reclamation systems, using reclaimed water, and purchasing backup water sources. As for floods and strong wind, also considered acute climate change disasters, TSMC has already designed flood prevention systems into new TSMC facilities and will therefore not be calculating its financial impact. TSMC has also estimated the cost of the Company's reputation from failing to meet net zero emission targets though there is no globally recognized approach to estimate such financial impact. The financial impact of 1% revenue was a consensus reached by experts after discussions and assessments. The estimated financial impact from climate opportunities includes reduced costs from increased energy and water use efficiency and diverse water sources as well as additional income from providing low-carbon products and services such as 7nm or more advanced processes, Power Management IC (PMICs), and ultralow power (ULP) ICs. Analysis results show that developing low-carbon products and services presents the greatest opportunity for positive financial impacts as demands for low-carbon products of 7nm and more advanced manufacturing process continue to grow."

                    "A": "In compliance with TCFD recommendations, TSMC has evaluated the impact of various GHG emission controls on TSMC operations and the supply chain for certain transition and physical risks. TSMC has considered the outcomes when determining the resiliency of strategies and has also referred to the latest physical science basis, published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to develop its own climate scenarios. In addition, TSMC has also included potential growth in carbon emissions from growing TSMC operations and new facilities as well as existing carbon reduction actions into general evaluations to analyze the potential financial impacts of climate risks. In the past, TSMC evaluated climate risks solely using the worst-case scenario, but the future of climate change is highly unpredictable. As such, TSMC has opted to evaluate climate risks across several scenarios this year to help map out and communicate operations strategies internally and give comprehensive insights into climate trends over the mid-tolong term. Climate Scenario Selection In terms of transition risks, countries have now reached a consensus, agreeing that carbon pricing schemes are a necessary policy to achieve net zero emissions. TSMC referenced World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO), an IEA report commonly used by companies around the world, and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to conduct climate scenario analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing then serves as the basis for TSMC to evaluate the impacts of carbon pricing schemes on TSMC locations in different countries. In terms of physical risks, TSMC referenced the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) published by IPCC in 2021 and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes in the future. TSMC also adopted the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) to derive GHG emissions under different social and economic landscapes. TSMC's impact analysis on physical risks covers climate change evaluations across every region of the globe and provides detailed impact analysis to TSMC locations and suppliers around the world through downscaling analysis."

In response to rising carbon costs from the global lowcarbon transitions, TSMC has started building an internal carbon pricing scheme, considering factors such as regulations, fines, market pricing, and cost of carbon reduction. The carbon pricing scheme reflects carbon costs in impact valuations of daily reduction measures and includes it when deciding whether to invest in a new facility. For example, TSMC implemented 684 energy conservation measures across eight categories in 2022 under the energy conservation program, saving 700 GWh in energy in 2022 alone. Evaluations using TSMC's internal carbon pricing scheme show that the potential external carbon costs from reducing carbon emissions are NT$530 million."

For climate scenario analysis we can run 30-year scenarios for both Physical and Transition Risk. Some elements of our Physical Risk scenario analysis can also extend to 2100.Processes used to determine material risks and opportunities • We utilise a range of tools and methodologies, to assess Transition and Physical Climate Risk, which we apply to our clients, portfolios and our own operations. These includes: scenario analysis, location-based hazard and risk scores, temperature alignment scores and Munich Re's NATHAN tool (acute physical risk impact assessments). • In addition, we engage with our corporate clients to understand their transition and physical risks, as well as their plans to prepare for climate change. • In 2022, we continued to enhance our understanding of climate-related risks, and significantly strengthened our stress testing and scenario analysis abilities for a range of management scenarios that are more plausible.Climate-related risk and opportunities identified • We have assessed the impact of Climate Risk to the banking book using scenario analysis over a 30-year time horizon, which has enabled us to identify and mitigate climate risks which may manifest. • In addition, sustainability and climate change have moved from being predominantly risk-based initiatives to becoming a value driver. This gives us an opportunity to deploy our market and industry knowledge to advise our clients on their individual sustainability journeys. • Sustainable finance is an opportunity to both defend our existing business from Transition Risk, and to fund our clients' transition from a high-carbon present to a low carbon future. Through supporting clients on their net zero journeys, and providing further finance to clients as they adapt to be less carbon intensive and emitting over time, we help mitigate their, and our, Transition Risk. Our aim to achieve Sustainable Finance income of $1 billion by 2025 and to mobilise $300 billion of Sustainable Finance by 2030 are measures of this success. • We do not fully disclose impacts on financial planning and performance (including proportions of income, costs and balance sheet related to climate-related opportunities), detailed Climate Risk exposures for all sectors and geographies or physical risk metrics.

Our progress is set out in the Financed emission section. • On climate-related opportunities, we have a $1 billion of Sustainable Finance income and $300 billion mobilisation of Sustainable Finance targets to 2025 and 2030 respectively. • During the year, we revised the measurement of our Oil and gas sector emissions from an income-based carbon intensity to absolute financed emissions to better reflect the sector emission profile, effectively creating a carbon budget for the sector which is intended to decrease over time. • In 2022, we continued to expand the coverage of our financed emissions calculations and this report announces three further sectoral targets covering transportation. By 2030, we aim to reduce emissions in the transportation sector: – 34% in aviation (production intensity) – Reduce our alignment delta in shipping from +2.6% to 0% – 49% in automotive manufacturers (production intensity).A description of the methodologies used to calculate targets and measures • The methodologies used to calculate baseline emissions are set out in the Our Clients – reducing our financed emissions section.Other key performance indicators used • In 2021, we set our Sustainability Aspirations to include an interim target to aim to reach net zero in our operations by 2030 and in our financed emissions by 2050. In 2022, we updated our target for reaching net zero in our operations by 2030 and brought it forward to 2025."
