ENERGY. ENERGIA. ENERGÍA. We are energy. An energy that is international and speaks many languages. We are a force driven by innovation toward a greener, more electric, and more sustainable future. It’s no longer a secret that we think of the wind, water, and sun as our greatest allies in our search for ever cleaner energy that reaches everyone in a fairer and more inclusive way. We set out our ambitious goals, always with a commitment to create a network of energy, talent, technology, with more global and efficient solutions. Decarbonize, digitalize, and decentralize are the action verbs on this path to change. We are spearheading the energy transition and assuming the responsibility to challenge the world to join us. Energy begins with us. And the future is today.

UM MUNDO EM DESCARBONIZAÇÃO. 
O ano de 2015 foi um ano exigente para o sector. A nível macroeconómico, questões geopolíticas, a desaceleração da China e de outros mercados emergentes, nomeadamente o Brasil, contribuíram para um fraco crescimento da economia global que registou o nível mais baixo desde 2009. O crescimento abaixo do nível potencial da generalidade das economias reflectiu-se num aumento da volatilidade nos mercados a nível global, nomeadamente no mercado das commodities com o valor do petróleo e do carvão a atingirem mínimos de 2006, o que contribui naturalmente para uma depreciação dos preços de energia. A acrescentar a este efeito, os níveis de consumo de electricidade na Europa continuam a manter-se em níveis de há uma década, reforçando assim o excesso de capacidade existente nomeadamente na Península Ibérica.

A message from the administration gri 102-14. 
The year 2019 marked the culmination of a trajectory of consolidation of EDP’s results in all segments of the business. Over the past decade, EDP Brasil has been transformed into a truly integrated company, with its performance a bellwether in all segments of the electricity sector value chain. At a time in which the EDP Group’s vision is focused on “leading the energy transition to create superior value”, during the year, we underscored our strategic position in all the key elements necessary for this transition. The results this year are the corollary of this successful strategy. EBITDA of R$ 2.914 billion and Net Income of R$ 1.338 billion, were records in a history of more than 20 years of EDP in Brazil.
\This performance is built especially on: (1) the operational improvements of the Distribution segment, particularly notable being both tariff revisions; (2) the boosting of the strategy of investments in Transmission, with excellence in execution; (3) the efficacious mitigation of the energy risk, through the integrated management of the generators with the commercialization company; (4) the expansion of a presence in the energy services area, notably in the distributed energy field; (5) the leadership and commitment in innovation and sustainability.
IMPROVEMENT IN THE PERFORMANCE OF DISTRIBUTION, PARTICULARLY IN THE RESULTS FOR BOTH TARIFF REVISIONS In the Distribution segment, the year was marked by tariff revisions at both Distributors – EDP SP and EDP ES. Thanks to investments made during the tariff cycle of approximately twice the reintegration quota, the average increase in the Distributors’ Net Remuneration Base has been lifted by an average of 36% with non-recognized investments of less than 0.5% (the reference amount for the sector) and a regulatory EBITDA superior to 31%. This investment made in both concession areas translated into a consistent reduction of non-technical losses to levels aligned with regulatory losses, as well as an across the board improvement in technical and service indicators.
REINFORCED STRATEGY OF INVESTMENT IN TRANSMISSION, WITH EXCELLENCE IN EXECUTION In Transmission, we reinforced our strategy for the segment with the acquisition of Lot Q, located along Santa Catarina/Rio Grande do Sul state divide, indicative of the Company’s performance in operating this new segment with a scale and returns above the market average. Overall, there are 6 lots with 1,441 km of power line, of which 187 km are in operation 20 months ahead of schedule, namely lot 24 located in the state of Espírito Santo together with the partial operation of lot 11 in the state of Maranhão. The remaining lots also have work in progress ahead of schedule. CAPEX in 2019 in this segment has grown to R$ 1.9 billion, representing on an accumulated basis more than 50% of the installation cost for the 6 projects under construction.
EFFICACIOUS MITIGATION OF THE ENERGY RISK THROUGH THE MANAGEMENT INTEGRATION OF THE GENERATION AND COMMERCIALIZATION SEGMENTS The hydrological scenario persisted below the historical average, having a direct impact on the plants and exposing them to a Generation Scaling Factor (GSF)1 of 80.9%. This low percentage has led the Company to position itself in such a manner as to protect its energy portfolio. The Group’s generation companies, together with the Commercialization Company, have kept around 20% of their energy decontracted for hedging purposes, fully mitigating the energy risk in the year. In addition, the Commercialization has once again posted exceptional results recording R$ 97 million in EBITDA and reinforcing its commitment to recurring results in this segment.
AN INCREASED PRESENCE IN THE ENERGY SERVICES AREA, PARTICULARLY IN DISTRIBUTED SOLAR ENERGY In line with the EDP Group’s global vision, EDP Brasil continues to make significant strides in the direction of the Brazilian electricity sec- tor’s energy transition and is among the leaders in the vanguard of this movement. It is in this context that this year we launched EDP Smart combining an entire portfolio of services offered to business and residential customers, providing integrated solutions in the areas of the Free Market, Retail Trading, Energy Efficiency, Solar Power, Electric Mobility, and End-Consumer Services. Our operations in the dynamic distributed solar energy and self-generation market have taken on a particularly important role. EDP ended the year with 24 MWp installed and a portfolio of a further 22 MWp under contract.
LEADERSHIP AND COMMITMENT IN INNOVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY For us, innovation and sustainability which we like to call “innovability”, are fundamental pillars of our strategy. With our full awareness of the current energy transition process, we place much emphasis on the investments we make in innovation. And this whether investing in the innovation ecosystem through our accelerator – EDP Starter – or our corporate venture capital – EDP Ventures -, or whether investing in the digitization and robotization of processes program or in research and development projects. In this environment, we would highlight the result of ANEEL’s Public Call for Electric Mobility projects in which EDP was successful in approving its three projects at an investment of R$ 50 million, which represents more than 10% of the total approved for the entire sector.
With respect to sustainability, we can report with satisfaction that for the 14th consecutive year, we are a component in B3’s Corporate Sustainability Stock Index (ISE) also being elected the “Best Company in Brazil for Transparency and Combating Corruption”
FOR THE NEW DECADE, EDP HAS UPDATED ITS GLOBAL STRATEGIC VISION TO “LEADERSHIP IN THE ENERGY TRANSITION TO CREATE SUPERIOR VALUE”
António Mexia - Chairman of the Board of Directors by the Guia EXAME de Sustentabilidade. These are just a few of our countless achievements on the sustainability front, reinforcing our lead in this area and our responsibility under the Global Compact Principles.
In the latest sector cycle, we renewed our commitment to sustainability by proposing new global targets for the 2019-2022 period, in line with the United Nations Organization’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). We also embraced the UN commitment to reducing emissions to maintain global warming at no more than 1.5 C, by subscribing the Business Ambition for 1.5 ºC – Our Only Future.
We ended 2019 on a high note. We delivered growth to which we had committed, improving the quality of our operations, managing the risks rigorously and investing with leadership in elements which will be key in the future. All that we have realized this year has only been possible for three fundamental motives of which we are proud, and which lend soundness, competitiveness and ambition to the business: (1) a strong culture; (2) a healthy balance sheet and (3) relationships of trust.

STRONG CULTURE The last few years have been intense in the work of strengthening our culture and reflected in growing levels of employee engagement. We have done this through the EDP Culture project, involving more than 3,000 EDP employees and our business partners. We have done this because we feel the need to experience a common trunk of values and principles in our entire organization, located nation wide. As a symbol of the EDP Culture, first and foremost comes our first guiding principle – safety which we invoke with the adage “life always in first place”. In 2019, we consolidated our activities in this sphere, working with the zero-accident objective, both with direct employees and service providers. We can record with satisfaction that we suffered no fatal accidents involving EDP’s employees. However, it is with much regret that we have to report one fatality with a business partner in Distribution. The fatality reaffirms the need to maintain the focus on EDP Culture’s first principle and to continue investing in the improvement of the accident prevention programs.
HEALTHY BALANCE SHEET During 2019, more than R$ 2.3 billion was raised, notably in the structuring of finance for the transmission lots. For lot 18, we launched an issue in the market of R$ 800 million with a duration of 20 years and a cost of IPCA+4.45%, and for the Maranhão lots. we concluded finance from BNB (Banco do Nordeste do Brasil). Our innovative strategy of financing the transmission segment in the capital markets was recognized in 2019, with the International Latin Finance award, Local Currency Financing category, recognizing the lot 21 issue at the end of 2018. We ended the year with a ratio of debt to operating result less than 2 times, which clearly signals our financial health. In the light of this financial soundness, we shall be in a position to distribute a dividend of R$ 1.00 per share, representing a year-on-year increase of 27% with a Dividend Yield of 4.5% and a payout ratio of 67%.
RELATIONS OF TRUST The relationship of trust with all our stakeholders continues an invaluable asset at EDP Brasil. To our more than 3 thousand employees, we owe their tireless dedication and energy, round the clock, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. They make EDP happen with excellence and quality. Our business partners also accompany us in this respect. With professionalism and with total delivery. To our clients, we owe loyalty and a long-lasting relationship. To our shareholders that have continued to place their trust in us, we owe the time and resources invested in EDP. To all these and to the other stakeholders, we register here our sincere and profound thanks.
CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE 2019 was an important year for the consolidation of the results reported and the strategic advances that we achieved in various areas of our activity. We ended the year stronger, more competitive, more innovative and sustainable. We again end the year with confidence in the future.
In 2020, we begin a new era for EDP in Brazil, with new challenges and with new ambitions. We will continue “to use our energy to always care better” and to continue to merit your trust.

For EDP Brasil, ethics and compliance are fundamental values for doing business and for overseeing stakeholder relations. The company has a Compliance program, which comprehends the Code of Ethics, training, the Ethics Channel and due diligence. This is aimed at mitigating risks related to corruption, bribery, money laundering, use of insider information, unfair competition, price fixing, child, forced and slave labor, among other things.
The Internal Audit and Compliance area reports on performance to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis. In 2019, the program was evaluated by an external consultancy. This enabled the company to determine its maturity, as well as to identify potential improvements.
Comparative data used in a survey applied by the same consultancy confirmed that EDP Brasil has a level of maturity higher than 84% of benchmark companies.
With the objective of minimizing risks in the value chain, strategic partners (suppliers and customers), including potential acquisitions or partnerships, are submitted to a due diligence process.. During the year,1,056 diligence processes were conducted on EDP Brasil business partners. Additionally, contracts with partners contain compliance clauses. Partners who act on behalf of EDP Brazil are obliged to abide by the company’s Code of Ethics.
The challenges for the coming years, with the digitalization and opening of the electricity sector, will include the protection of customer data. With this in view, in 2019 a project was implemented to map company data in order to meet the requirements of Brazil’s General Data Protection Law. This involved the company’s Information Technology, Legal, Regulatory, Human Resources and Compliance areas. The objective was to obtain an in-depth diagnosis and ensure that EDP Brasil processes, tools and policies are compliant with legal requirements.
ANTI-CORRUPTION. 
Worthy of note during the year was the preparation for ISO 37.001 standard certification, which contains requirements for the establishment, maintenance, critical analysis and improvement of an Anti-Corruption Management System. As a result, rules were updated and created to ensure compliance with the standards in the areas of Gifts, Presents and Events; Combating Illicit Events; Compliance; Interaction with Public Authorities; Donations, Sponsorship and Support and Assessment of Consequences.
In December, EDP Brasil’s good practices were recognized with the granting of an ISO 37001 standard Recommendation Letter. The recognition, which has a certification validity of 3 years with annual maintenance, reinforces the company’s culture of integrity and transparency.
The company also organized an Anti-Corruption Week, the highlight of which was Innovethics, an event for senior management addressing the ethical challenges involved in innovation.
In 2019, EDP Brasil included anti-corruption policy and procedures in its communication plan, reaching all company employees and 1,821 business partners. GRI 205-1, 205-2. 
CODE OF ETHICS GRI 102-16, 103 | 406 The ethical principles guiding the company’s activities are set forth in the EDP Brasil Code of Ethics, available to everyone via the link http:// www.edp.com.br/codigo-de-etica-edp. The document addresses questions related to legal compliance, integrity, respect for human and labor rights, among others.
In 2019, after an internal campaign to drive adhesion to the Code of Ethics, 96% of the employees signed the document.
Moreover, employees take part in regular compliance training programs. During the year a series of videos and communications were disseminated via diverse internal channels aimed at consolidating the behavioral dimension of ethics and compliance. By the end of 2019, 90.5% of the company’s employees had completed training on ethics and compliance.
RECOGNITION DURING THE YEAR, EDP BRASIL’S GOOD PRACTICES WERE RECOGNIZED WITH THE RECEIPT OF THE ISO 37.001 STANDARD LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION, WHICH REINFORCES THE COMPANY’S CULTURE OF INTEGRITY AND TRANSPARENCY.

ETHICS CHANNEL GRI 102-17, 102-33, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3 EDP Brasil has an Ethics Channel administered by an external consultancy to receive reports related to ethical questions and conduct. This is accessible via email, website, post office box or voice mail.
All reports are investigated by an internal team and then assessed by the Ethics Committee, comprising the CEO, the four Vice Presidents and two EDP Portugal representatives, with the participation of the directors of the Internal Audit and Compliance, Legal and People Management areas. A total of 145 reports were received in 2019, an increase of 32% over 2018. GRI 102-17, 205-3. 
The increase in the number of reports reflects greater familiarity and confidence in the channel, as well as the company’s efforts to disseminate it. As a means of promoting even greater transparency in this area, in 2019, the company started to divulge metrics on the Ethics Channel’s activities to all employees in the workplace (the internal social network).
2.3 RISK MANAGEMENT GRI 102-15, 102-30, 103-2. 
At EDP Brasil, risk management is undertaken in an integrated manner in order to ensure that the diverse risks inherent to each of the company’s areas are managed by those responsible and reported to the Board. The management process is based on methodologies such as COSO ERM – Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and ISO 31.000.

3.2 STRATEGIC PLANNING. 
EDP Brasil strategy is based on robust governance in conjunction with sustainability and innovation. Engaged in the entire electric utility sector chain, the company seeks to manage a balanced portfolio of assets with sustained growth, superior efficiency and controlled risk.
In March 2019, EDP Brasil updated its global strategic vision from “An integrated company, leader in value creation, sustainability and innovation” to “Leadership of the energy transition for the creation of superior value".
EDP Brasil believes that the energy transition is sustained by three platforms, known as the 3D transition.
ENERGY PLANNING GRI 102-11, EU6. 
The energy planning area uses forecasts to guide management of the Generation, Distribution and Commercialization segments. With this focus, a new computational model was developed to monitor energy prices – previously monitored weekly – on an hourly basis. Regarding hydrological risk, EDP Brasil participated in discussions on the enhancement of the sector’s thermoelectric park for low-cost thermal generation in accordance with need. The objective is to help drive greater efficiency, reduced costs and the mitigation of impacts from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
Also worthy of note was the announcement of EDP Ventures’ investment in Fractal, a Santa Catarina company that develops solutions related to managing hydrological risks and intelligent systems for dam management, helping to drive process improvement and the application of best practices in generation assets. Further information in Innovation.
During the course of the year, the Commercialization area was engaged in the management of the company’s energy portfolio, working jointly with the generators in energy purchase and sale transactions. The energy allocation strategy takes into account annual seasonal variation factors, both in relation to sales contracts and physical guarantees.
In addition to availability and efficiency in generation, the company has focused on new services by means of the launch of the EDP Smart brand, investment in distribution networks and the consolidation of the transmission business.
The objective is to guarantee portfolio diversification aimed at mitigating risks – water, price, macroeconomic, for example –, the stability of the company’s results in the long term, as well as preparation for the coming transformation in the electrical power sector, which includes the opening up of the market.
In this respect, EDP Brasil’s investment priorities in the coming years will be innovation, networks, new services and human capital, an essential asset for business development. Further information on each business is presented in Operating Performance.
MANAGEMENT TOOLS The company’s activities are supported by the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) methodology and by the ISO 14.001, ISO 9.001 and OHSAS 18.001/ISO 45.001 certification standards. The company also employs Lean and Kaizen methodologies to optimize processes and reduce wastage. Company performance is tracked in monthly meetings involving the entire company leadership´(Operations Review).
And, to support the new vision and the 3D transition, EDP Brasil strategy is underpinned by five pillars:
Decentralization Digitalization Decarbonization preparation for the opening up of the market, with the expansion of the free energy market, by means of investment in distributed generation, growth in sources of renewable energies, reduction in the costs of solar panels and batteries, incentives in regulation for distributed energy, blockchain, among other factors.
cross cutting all business fronts, this includes new technologies, robotization projects, partnerships and the internet of things (IoT), smart grids, data use (big data and analytics), connected homes, prosumer (energy producing consumer) logic, new products and services, personalization, among other fronts.
this consists of the transition of the energy matrix to clean energies, storage with batteries, energy efficiency, electric mobility, environmental commitments, among other initiatives.

INNOVATION LOUNGE One highlight in 2019 was the creation of a collaborative work space involving diverse company areas engaged in the development of strategic digital transformation projects, new products and services. The teams working in the space include Innovation, Ventures, EDP Smart – B2C services, Analytics, Digital – and CER - Center of Excellence in Robotization. They work in an integrated fashion, applying agile methodology in employee squads dedicated to specific projects. This area is also available as a co-working space to engage start-ups and business partners in co-creation and joint development projects with EDP Brasil.
3.3 INNOVATION. 
As an essential focus for running the business and ensuring continuity, innovation is deeply engrained in EDP Brasil’s vision, values and culture. The company’s efforts are focused on five innovation pillars that reflect macrotrends in the transformation of the electricity sector – energy storage, clean energy, digital innovation, intelligent grids and customer-focused solutions –, as well as access to energy and innovation in internal processes.
OPEN INNOVATION • Starter Acceleration Program: start-up engagement program, the main objective here is to generate businesses involving the company and the enterprise ecosystem by means of the development of new technologies and the joint development of projects that enable the creation of superior value throughout the EDP Brasil value chain. In 2019, the program entered its third edition and was conducted on a global scale, with submissions open to all countries. Projects were selected for acceleration modules in three regions: Latin America (module in Brazil), North America (module in the United States) and Europe (module in Spain). During the year more than 500 start-ups made submissions, of which 129 in Brazil. From this total, 30 start-ups were selected to participate in the program, 9 of which in Brazil. The Australian start-up, LexX Technologies, was selected as the overall winner of the first global edition, receiving a prize of 50,000 euros during the grand finale of the program at the WebSummit in Lisbon. Based on concepts driving industry 4.0, the start-up developed a solution that combines artificial intelligence and machine learning to optimize assessment of the maintenance and efficiency of energy assets.
• EDP Ventures Brasil: the first corporate venture capital initiative in the electricity sector in Brazil, EDP Ventures undertook co-investments totalling some R$ 4.7 million in 2019. Worthy of note are Dom Rock, a start-up that develops solutions that support companies in handling large volumes of data – which have already been replicated in the regulatory and digital areas at EDP Brasil, as well as in managing employee benefits –; Fractal Engenharia e Sistemas, a Santa Catarina-based company that develops solutions for forecasting hydrological events and smart systems to assist in dam management; and Delfos, which is focused on developing artificial intelligence applied to the predictive maintenance of energy generation assets.
• Free Electrons: a consortium formed by EDP Brasil in partnership with another nine utilities created Free Electrons, an acceleration program focused on generating business with start-ups and scale-ups- mature companies scaling up to operate internationally. The initiative provides the start-ups with access to global partners who may help them to boost their traction in new markets, as well as enabling access to venture capital funds from participating power companies. In 2020, the program will have a module in Brazil for the first time ever. The program comprises three week-long modules: the first will take place in Sydney, Australia; the second, for the first time, in São Paulo; and third will be in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, where the overall winner, which will receive the prize of US$ 200,000, will be announced.
INTERNAL INNOVATION CULTURE • IMentors: a training program for employees in innovation techniques focused on the development of new solutions applicable to the challenges faced by the businesses, ranging from the idealization phase with the application of design thinking, to prototyping using agile methodology. The initiative is open to employees from all the EDP Brasil business units. Currently 30 employees have been selected and trained to act as multipliers of the innovation culture throughout the company. In 2019, 226 employees enrolled, resulting in five groups with project proposals that are currently under development in the business areas.
• Go Innovation & InnovEthics: this is an initiative promoted by the Innovation area aimed at generating innovative solutions, classifying and recognizing the employees responsible for the implementation of the best projects to drive the company’s innovation culture, based on merit and enterprise. The initiative receives voluntary project submissions from employees at all the EDP Brasil business units. These are evaluated by technical boards comprising company executives in events held at the respective units. In 2019, there was a record submission of 187 projects. Employees presented their pitches to the technical boards, with the five best qualifying for the final. The award presentation ceremony took place during Innovethics, an event that debated the ethics of innovation in the light of new technologies. In addition to EDP Brasil employees, the event was attended by the chairman of the Ethics Committee, journalists, lecturers and CEOs from other companies engaged in the innovation debate.
• Immersion in Innovation hubs: the EDP Group promotes executive immersion programs for leaders in international benchmark innovation hubs, aimed at expanding their knowledge and training them by means of talks and visits to leading technology and energy companies. The program was initiated in 2017, with three groups a year undergoing immersions in Silicon Valley, in the United Sates. Up until 2019, 29 EDP Brasil executives had participated in the program. Last year a new hub was opened, with the first group undertaking an immersion in China, one of the most impressive innovation ecosystems focused on hardware and artificial intelligence in the world.
• 360 Innovation Forum: in times of constant change in consumer behaviour and patterns, the company created its 360 Innovation Forum, an event open to the company’s internal audience with the participation of external guests. Two editions of the forum were held in 2019. These involved the diverse areas related to innovation, as well as the company’s main executives. The purpose was to create an environment in which to discuss the use of innovation to leverage business sustainability.

ROBOTIZATION Three years after the implementation of the use of robots in its activities, in 2019 EDP Brasil saw advances not only in the volume of automated processes, but also the incorporation of greater intelligence into robotization. This was demonstrated by the size of the robot park during the year, which grew to 171 units, as well as the technological evolution of these machines from first generation to generation 3+, with the employment of machine learning techniques. The cumulative number of robotized hours during the period exceeded 129,000.
The robot shared services system Robô I Serviços Partilhados or RISP, which marked the beginning of the robotization program, was reviewed in 2019 in line with best development practices and extended to more than 76 municipalities. Moreover, projects worthy of note in the period include: • The implementation of 3+ generation robots for proactive communication with customers: using artificial intelligence, the robot identifies customers in areas facing potential power blackouts proactively, informing them about the power outage and the projected duration before the call center is involved; • RPA (Robotic Process Automation): this consists of the enhancement of governance using a platform specifically developed to control the life cycle of each robotized activity, ensuring transparency, agility and reliability for the areas responsible for the robots developed and administered by the Center of Excellence in Robotization (CER). It should be noted that EDP Brasil has been considered a benchmark in this area, both in Brazil and in the international market, having been contacted by more than 60 companies interested in learning more about the company’s governance practices. Due to the large number of benchmarking requests, every six months the company holds an event called Conversation Round in which it shares its experience in this area, the lessons it has learned, as well as promoting networking among the participants.
For the coming years, the plan is to further expand the robot park, with a focus on gains in efficiency and productivity, as well as the development of future generations of robots, boosting the use of artificial intelligence technologies.
DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION AND DECENTRALIZATION EDP Brasil believes that the digital transformation movement is a strategic agenda, associated not only with the employment of leading edge technology, but also efficient processes and a change in mindset. In this respect, in line with company strategy and future vision, EDP Brasil restructured the People Management area as a means of furthering the company’s digital transformation. The EDP Agility area has now incorporated the Center of Excellence in Robotization (CER) into its structure, as well as the Analytics and Digital teams, which were previously in the Information Technology (IT) area.
Particularly noteworthy among the diverse digital initiatives developed at EDP Brasil is the OBZ Digital project, which was initiated in 2019 and will come to fruition in 2020. Aimed at driving efficiency in the corporate center, this involves diverse projects revolving around processes, technology and people. Another major focus is initiatives that drive improvements in customer relations.
With a focus on decentralization – due to the definition of well-established internal governance processes and the increased demand for new robotization opportunities from diverse company areas and the need to streamline decision making processes in operational areas –, in 2019 the activities of the CER and the Analytics team were further decentralized, in line with company strategy.
In conjunction with the EDP University, new groups were formed for employees interested or indicated for training in the CER platform and tool and to prepare data scientists as a means of expanding knowledge and decentralizing it.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) GRI EU8 EDP Brasil participates in the ANEEL Research & Development Program, contributing 0.4% of the net operating revenue from the generators and 0.2% from the distributors to research and development (R&D) projects. This involved a total investment of R$ 47.9 million in R&D in 2019, with R$ 19.7 million coming from Generation and R$ 28.2 million from Distribution.
One of the main highlights in 2019 was the approval of three EDP Brasil electric mobility projects in an ANEEL strategic tender. These represent an R&D investment of R$ 50 million, with funding from the regulatory agency’s research and development fund, as well as funds from the company and partners.
The main project involves an investment of R$ 32.9 million. In partnership with the Volkswagen Group and other technology suppliers, EDP Brasil will build the first state network with 30 ultra-fast electric vehicle charging stations. The venture will involve a total of 64 charging points connecting São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Vitória, Curitiba and Florianopolis, forming a power supply corridor for electric vehicles over 2,500 km in length.
The second project involves the creation of an e-Lounge with various charging points for electric vehicles close to an airport. This project will be focused on providing charging services, ensuring convenience for taxi-drivers and app drivers while they wait for passengers. The third project involves the replacement of diesel buses with electric models in the state of Espírito Santo.
In Distribution, the main highlight was an intelligent network laboratory for tests and simulations involving distributed generation. Conducted in partnership with the University of São Paulo (USP), the project was submitted to proof of concept in Espírito Santo with 73,000 customers, involving the use of smart metering, automatic switches and 3G, with decision making supported by artificial intelligence. The trial will be concluded in 2020 and then expanded.
The project also uses Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), that is two drones with high definition cameras and intelligent image recognition capabilities to ensure operational efficiency in network maintenance.
INTERNAL ACCELERATION EDP Brasil, in partnership with Accenture, has formed the Smart Energy Lab, an initiative that involves the integration of staff from both companies to create new solutions based on technologies in the areas of distributed solar generation, intelligent energy management, electric mobility, financial solutions and energy storage, among others. The first Smart Energy Lab project was focused on the development of a distributed solar energy solution based on blockchain technology to be offered to EDP Brasil customers.
The initiative is based in Porto Digital, an innovation and technology development hub located in the city of Recife. In parallel, market tests are being conducted in the headquarters of the companies in São Paulo.

BUSINESS PERFORMANCE 4.1 MACROECONOMIC AND SECTOR CONJUNCTURE. 
Within the context of the stabilization of the macroeconomic situation in Brazil, the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by 1.0%1 in the first nine months of the year. Worthy of note on the supply side were the agriculture and livestock (+1.4%) and service (+1.1%) sectors, while in demand Gross Fixed Capital Formation and Household Consumption Expenditure grew by 3.1% and 1.8% respectively.
Between January and November, industrial production decreased by 1.1%2, influenced by the economic crisis in Argentina and the tragedy occurred in Brumadinho (MG) at the beginning of the year, which had a major impact on mining activities. The extraction industry (-9.5%) exercised the largest negative influence on the indicator, accompanied by the categories pulp, paper and paper products (-3.9%), maintenance, repair and installation of machinery and equipment (-9.1%), as well as steel (-2.2%).
In contrast, retail activity recovered, with sales volume in the retail sector growing by 3.8%3 in the year up to November. This growth was driven by: i) reduction in interest rates4, which reached their lowest historical level (4.5% p.a.); ii) low inflation5 (4.31%, close to the annual target of 4.25%); and iii) expansion of credit terms6. In November, consumer credit demand showed its largest 12-month variation since 2011, increasing by 11.5%.
This environment also influenced the labor market, with the balance of formal job vacancies increasing by 2.47%7 (+948,300) in the first 11 months of the year. The service sector was responsible for the major positive contribution, with the creation of 495,577 formal job vacancies.

HYDROLOGICAL STATUS The year was also characterized by challenges in the hydrological situation, with rainfall below expected levels at the beginning of the wet season in the Southeast sub-market (SE/MW). The slow resumption of streamflow levels compromised the recuperation of reservoirs, ending the month of April – end of the wet season – with 45% energy stored, 1% above the level in same period of the previous year.
In spite of intervals with improved rainfall, the Southeast ended the year with 80% of the long-term average Affluent Natural Energy (ANE) accumulated and 19.9% of Stored Energy (EARM). In the Northeast, the ANE remained below average, ending the year with a long-term average of 41% and 37.7% stored energy. This situation influenced the average Difference Settlement or Spot price for the year, at R$ 225.65/ MWh for the Southeast/Midwest and R$ 166.78/MWh for the Northeast. The average Generation Scaling Factor (GSF) was 80.9%, reaching a minimum of 48.8% in August.
In the electric utility sector, according to the National Energy Balance (BEN) 2019 – base year 2018, published by Empresa de Pesquisa Energética (EPE) –, domestic energy supply reached 636.4 TWh, an increase of 1.7% compared with 2017.
REGULATORY SITUATION The main questions in regulatory debates during the course of the year were: • Solution for the GSF: in pursuit of a conclusion to unlock the short-term market through a solution for GSF liabilities, in 2019 the plenary of the Chamber of Deputies approved bill of law 10.985, which establishes new conditions for reformulating hydrological risk for hydroelectric power generators. The solution for hydrological risk incorporates permission to renegotiate over R$ 7 billion in debts accumulated by generators in the short-term market, which should be compensated with the extension of the terms for the part of the amount not recognized as risk for the plants. The bill was sent to the Senate to be voted, where it is still in process.
• Hourly Difference Settlement (Spot) rate (PLD): The PLD is a reference for energy purchase and sale contracts in the shortterm market and is currently calculated on a weekly basis by the Electrical Energy Commercialization Chamber (CCEE). The change in the calculation of the Difference Settlement Price (PLD), which involves a new computational model to program generation plant dispatch by the National System Operator (ONS), was postponed until 2021. For 2020, it was decided that the system would operate with semi-hourly dispatch, without effectively using the process for price formation.
• Regulatory WACC: in 2019, ANEEL approved a public hearing to discuss the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The discussion about the change in calculation methodology and the updating of the distributors’ WACC was initiated between October and December, after ANEEL announced preliminary figures for the three segments (rate of 6.81% for generation and transmission and 7.17% for distribution). Among other alterations, the proposal should prioritize national parameters, as well as greater simplification. The resolution is expected to be approved by March 2020.
• Incentives for distributed generation: during the year, ANEEL initiated a public hearing to gather information for analysis of the regulatory impact of the rules for micro and mini generation. The discussions progressed, leading to a public consultation in October, with proposals for a gradual end to subsidies. However no conclusion was reached, and discussion of the question will continue throughout 2020.
• Opening of market: in continuation of the process of opening up the market for consumers of more than 2,000 kW initiated in 2018, a schedule was established for the progressive expansion for agents consuming up to 500 kW. The schedule is as follows: 1,500 kW from 2021, 1,000 kW from 2022 and 500 kW from 2023. New studies to assess the opening of the market to consumers of less than 500 kW from 2024 should be presented by January 31, 2022.
• Tariff bands: during the year ANEEL approved the resolution that establishes the activation limits for the bands and the tariffs in force in 2019. A methodological advance was incorporated for the activation rule that updates the hydrological risk profile (GSF), reducing the seasonality of the physical assurance in the composition of the revenue for the band ("flat seasonality"). As a result the yellow band was fixed at R$ 1.50 for each 100 kWh. The cost of the red band at level 1 was fixed at R$ 4.00 for each 100 kWh, and at level 2, R$ 6.00 for each 100 kWh.
Additionally, during the year an Electric Utility Modernization Working Group was created aimed at reforming the regulatory framework for the sector. This will evaluate topics such as price formation, supply criteria, separation between ballast and energy, distribution sustainability, the auction system, contracting process, Energy Reallocation Mechanism (MRE) and the integration of gas-electric energy. A Modernization Implementation Committee was established with an implementation schedule of two years, which may be extended for another year, to introduce the modifications proposed.
Within this context, two bills of law on the reform of the electric sector are in process: PLS 232/2016, under discussion in the Senate; and PL 1.917/15, in the Chamber of Deputies. Both bills address the electric sector commercial model, the portability of electricity bills and electricity generation concessions in alignment with the Electric Utility Modernization Working Group.
GENERATION EDP Brasil ended 2019 with a portfolio comprising six hydroelectric and one thermoelectric plant, with a total installed capacity of 2.9 GW and an average assured capacity of 1.9 GW.
Worthy of note during the year was the 92.5% availability at TPP Pecém, higher than the 83.75% reference. The accumulated availability (60 months) of hydroelectric plants was 93.7%, a significant advance against the internal target of achieving 95% accumulated availability by 2022, principally by means of reducing forced outages – achieved by improvements in root cause analysis methodologies and a reduction in recurring failures – and the optimization of program-
BEST PLANT IN BRAZIL ACCORDING TO ANEEL In 2019, the HPP Luís Eduardo Magalhães was selected by ANEEL as the best in Brazil from over 100 plants evaluated by the regulatory agency during an inspection campaign conducted in 2018. The EDP Brasil plant received a score of 99.55 in the overall plant ranking, gaining the top score of 100 points in Safety, Environment, Operational Management and Maintenance Management, and 99.56 points in Operation and Maintenance.
Two other plants controlled by EDP Brasil – HPP Peixe Angical, also located in Tocantins, and HPP Mascarenhas, in Espírito Santo – came among the top 15 in the ranking, which evaluated 144 plants in the country.
4.2 OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE med stoppage strategies.
At HPP Luís Eduardo Magalhães, work on modernization of the supervision, command and control system was concluded. During the year the plant achieved its highest level of accumulated availability (60 months), reaching 97.6%.
Meanwhile, in the HPP Peixe Angical, work on modernizing the voltage regulation system was also concluded. During the year the plant achieved its highest level of accumulated availability (60 months), reaching 96.2%. The generation operation energy volume grew 64.8% in the period, resulting in an increase in the number of bilateral contracts with the commercialization operation, as well as the seasonality, hedging and cash management strategy adopted by the company.
TRANSMISSION One of the company’s main investment focuses during the year, the Transmission segment ended 2019 with six projects that have a total extension of 1,441 km, 113 km of which in operation in Espírito Santo and 1,328 km under construction in another five Brazilian states – Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul, São Paulo, Minas Gerais and Maranhão. GRI EU4. 
In line with EDP Brasil business expansion strategy, worthy of note during the year was the acquisition of Lot Q (auctioned in the 1st stage of the 13/2015 transmission auction on 13/4/2016), by means of a purchase and sale contract with CEE Power and Brafer. Comprising two sub-stations and 142 km of transmission lines divided into two sections, it is located between Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, reinforcing the company’s position in the South of the country.
Another positive factor was the progress in work on all the projects, which are ahead of schedule. Particularly noteworthy was lot 11, with an extension of 203 km, with the delivery of the Chapadinha-Miranda (Maranhão) section in 2019. A total of R$ 2.2 billion, representing 57% of the amount contracted, has already been disbursed. The company also ensured the installation licenses for all the lines, bringing forward the licenses for lots 18 and 21.
For lot 18, consisting of two transmission lines of approximately 375 km in extension each covering municipalities in the states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais, EDP Brasil concluded the public offer of 800,000 debentures amounting to R$ 800 million, maturing in 2039.
Lot 7 in Maranhão; lot 18 in São Paulo-Minas Gerais; and lot 21 in Santa Catarina are scheduled to be delivered in 2020, with a focus on the continued expansion of this segment in the company’s portfolio.

8.24. 
PERIODIC TARIFF REVIEW One of the major highlights in Distribution in 2019 was the conclusion of the EDP Espírito Santo and EDP São Paulo Periodic Tariff Review. In the former, the process resulted in a 4.84% reduction in the average tariff for the consumer and an increase of 28.1% in the Net Remuneration Base and 15.7% in Portion B. In the EDP São Paulo review, concluded in October 2019, there was a 5.33% reduction in the average tariff for the consumer and a 45.3% increase in the Net Remuneration Base and 24.8% in Portion B.
The result reinforces the company’s commitment to generating gains for the end consumer by means of tariff reductions while ensuring the remuneration of the concessionaires for the investments undertaken in service quality, operational efficiency and reductions in energy losses, and retentions (energy acquired to cover electrical losses above the regulatory limits), which were close to zero for both distributors.
DISTRIBUTION EDP Brasil operates in Distribution through concessionaires in the states of São Paulo and Espírito Santo, as well as through Celesc, in Santa Catarina. In 2019, the company increased its share in this state through the acquisition of additional preferred stock in Celesc. With an investment of R$28.5 million, EDP Brasil increased its stake to 4.6 million preferred shares in Celesc, as well as its 5.14 million ordinary shares, representing an increase from a 23.56% to a 25.35% shareholding in the the company’s stock.
EDP São Paulo and EDP Espírito Santo serve over 3.5 million customers in 28 cities in the Upper Tietê, Vale do Paraíba and North Coast regions of São Paulo; and in 70 cities covering 90% of the state of Espírito Santo.
The volume of energy distributed during the year was 25.6 TWh, an increase of 2.34% over 2018. During the cycle, the company invested R$ 1.8 billion in the distribution business, approximately twice the Regulatory Reintegration Quota, and higher than the previous year’s investment. GRI EU3. 
Supply quality GRI 103 | EU28, EU29 In spite of the impact of climate-related factors, EDP Brasil has been improving its quality indicators in compliance with regulatory limits. In 2019, Power Outage Duration (DEC) indicators were the best ever, with 6.98 for EDP São Paulo and 8.19 for EDP Espírito Santo.
The main quality indicator improvement initiatives involved the elaboration of the DEC Down project, which included the implementation of initiatives to reduce outages, ensure rapid restoration of power supply and limit network impacts.

Total losses GRI EU12 With respect to losses, EDP Brasil combats fraud and irregular power consumption through initiatives such as anti-theft devices for networks, remote telemeasurement of consumption, registration regularization, modernization of public lighting and measurement inspections.
There was a 0.33% reduction in total losses for EDP São Paulo and a 0.52 p.p. increase for EDP Espírito Santo compared with the previous year. The increase in EDP Espírito Santo was due mainly to the exit of another electrical power distribution concessionaire from the state system. Additionally, the less favorable water generation situation combined with market growth contributed to the increase in energy losses.
Investments in measures to tackle losses totaled R$ 101 million in 2019 and comprehended principally the replacement of obsolete meters and the development of technological solutions such as telemeasurement and concentrated measurement systems – BTzero and BT1. A total of 145,000 measurement inspections were performed during the year.
EDP SMART EDP Brasil believes that the opening of the free market will be a reality in the medium term. Accordingly, in line with its strategy and future vision, in 2019 the company created EDP Smart, a brand comprising a full portfolio of products and services for business and residential free market customers. The focus is on offering integrated solutions in the areas of free market commercialization, retail commercialization, energy efficiency, solar energy, electric mobility and end consumer services.
For the business market, EDP Smart offers solutions such as biomass-based steam co-generation, energy consumption management, smart monitoring, distributed generation and auto-generated solar production, lighting, refrigeration and air conditioning retrofits, among others. The company also introduced the offer of a series of services for the residential market in 2019, including insurance and general services, such as electricians, locksmiths, 24-hour residential assistance, distributed generation and electric mobility.

Commercialization In 2019, EDP Brasil commercialized 16,078 GWh of energy with a ballast of 12,994 GWh, a reduction of 16.9% over the last year. The lower volume is explained initially by a reduction in market liquidity as a whole in response to events that occurred in the first quarter. In the second half of the year, the reduced volume was the result of an unfavorable hydrological situation which impacted the GSF and the Difference Settlement Price (PLD).
In the retail segment, responsible for managing the energy contracting and operating process in the free market, EDP Brasil gained new customers in 2019. Public Consultation nº 76 (CP nº 76/2019) was conducted to simplify access for new consumers in the free energy contracting environment (ACL).
Within this context, the Commercialization area initiated the development of a digital system for retail consumers which should be launched in 2020.
Moreover, all company processes were reviewed and the management system was modified to promote improvements in customer service. The changes included new functions for the sales team, reviews of service procedures, contract minutes and delinquency control mechanisms, as well as training courses for the Commercialization team and a workshop for customers.
Solar energy In the distributed solar and auto-generation segment, EDP Brasil made important progress: • Inauguration of the largest decentralized solar energy complex ever implemented by EDP Brasil in the state of Minas Gerais, with a capacity of 8.33 MWp. The system will generate16.6 GWh per year, enough to supply around 8,600 residences. In line with company low carbon strategy, the complex will avoid CO2eq emissions of 31,107 tons over 25 years of operation, equivalent to planting over 190,000 trees; it will drive savings of R$ 55 million in the course of 10 years.
• Construction of an auto-generation solar plant for the new recording studio of a large television company in Curicica, Rio de Janeiro. The plant will have an installed capacity of 760 kWp and will be able to generate 1,055 MWh/year, enough to supply around 350 residences with an average monthly consumption of 250 kWh. During the 25-year working life of the plant, approximately 2,000 tons of CO2eq emissions will be avoided, the equivalent of planting around 12,000 trees.
• Solar B2C: launch of a photovoltaic solar solution for residential and small business consumers. Initially EDP Smart strategy focused on the EDP Brasil concession areas in São Paulo and Espírito Santo, increasing the offer to other regions in accordance with company expansion strategy. Moreover, EDP Smart has a simulator for the acquisition of photovoltaic panels that indicates the estimated monthly savings with a solar system, the number of modules necessary to meet the customer’s consumption requirements, as well as the cost and the return on investment and the possibility of arranging finance.
Electric mobility In step with global decarbonization, decentralization and digitalization trends, one of the EDP Group’s strategic thrusts worldwide and in Brazil has been electric mobility. Accordingly, in 2019 a new area was created with a focus on the development of products and services for the electric vehicle, residential and business markets.
EDP Brasil already had some key initiatives in this area, such as the Rio-São Paulo electric corridor which connects the two largest state capitals along the Via Dutra highway with six fast charging stations. With the creation of the new area, the company portfolio was expanded with the offer of a range of small to large scale electric chargers for private use.
The company has also expanded the offer of charging points in public spaces, using its network’s utility poles with activation via a card that may be requested directly from the EDP Smart website (https://www.edpsmart.com.br/residencias/mobilidade-eletrica). Moreover, a number of customized solutions have been developed for business customers (B2B and B2B2C), promoting the replacement of fleets with electric vehicles and developing energy supply infrastructure. Some of the main initiatives in the period were: • Approval of three major R&D projects by ANEEL totaling R$ 50 million (further information in Innovation), involving the plan for the first and largest ultra fast charging network for electric vehicles in Latin America; the integrated supply solution project (e-Lounge) and a development project for electric buses in Espírito Santo.
• The installation of eight public charging stations in the state of Espírito Santo, in conjunction with Findes, the state federation of industries, enabling electric vehicle users to travel anywhere in the state.
These and other initiatives resulted in: 24 MWp.

The partnership also includes the installation of 30 charging stations in the automaker’s dealerships nationwide.
Energy Efficiency Services • Launch of Facilita EDP, 24-hour residential assistance with locksmith, electrician, plumber and domestic appliance repair services. Based on a monthly subscription model, the service is available for customers nationwide.
• A basket of insurance services, Seguro EDP Casa Protegida (Protected Home), Seguro Bem-Estar EDP (Well-Being) and Seguro EDP Conta Protegida (Protected Account), with coverage ranging from fires, lightning, loss of income from involuntary unemployment and accidental death, with 24-hour emergency assistance for customers within the concession areas in São Paulo and Espírito Santo.
• Implantation of two projects that will enable a brewery company to use the steam produced for energy generation in plants located in Igrejinha (RS) and Benevides (PA), with a monthly biomass and biogas-based steam production of approximately 6,600 tons. This will permit the avoidance of around 13,000 tCO2eq emissions per year**.

4.3 ECONOMIC-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE GRI 103 | 201. 
Gross Margin Gross Margin reached R$ 4,159 million, an increase of 8.8%, reflecting:
Distribution: increase of 22.9% due to the recognition of the new replacement value resulting from the asset evaluation reports for the distributors’ tariff revisions, the tariff effect of the revisions, as well as the increase in energy volume during the period;
Transmission: an increase of R$ 208.5 million, due to the progress in works in the period and the entry into operation of Lot 24;
Pecém: a 14.6% reduction due to the inclusion of the FID recalculation in 2018 from 90.14% to 83.75%;
Commercialization: a 37.5% reduction due to the lower volume of energy commercialized; and. 
Hydro: a 10.4% reduction due to the sale of EDP PCH, Santa Fé and Costa Rica em 2018. Not taking the gross margin of these companies in 2018 into account, this figure would grow by 2.9% in function of the increase in energy sold due to the greater seasonality in the sale contracts and the physical assurance for the 2nd half of the year.

EDP Brasil realizes that its employees are a fundamental link in running its businesses. In 2019, the company had 3,283 employees, 95 of which in its joint ventures, as well as 192 trainees, interns and apprentices in which it invests constantly to promote development and recognition as well as ensuring health, safety and well-being, among other initiatives. GRI 102-8. 
The period was marked by the consolidation of the EDP Culture, a cultural transformation project based on the company’s principles. After the junction of the Human Resources and Organizational Transformation areas, EDP Brasil consolidated a new structure that also incorporated the Sustainability, Environment and Digital areas.
This was also the second year of the implementation of EDP Agility, a hybrid organizational design model which maintains its conventional structure, with the inclusion of hubs to streamline decision making. 2019 also saw the creation of Shift, with a team dedicated full-time to the creation of new solutions. This multidisciplinary team ensures the application and tracking of agile methodology to the challenges proposed by the organization, particularly in relation to culture and people management. In addition to generating ideas for new solutions, the team is also responsible for initiating implementation.
AS A RESULT OF THIS CONSOLIDATION ONE OF THE PROJECTS CREATED DURING THE YEAR WAS THE EDP STAR AWARD, AIMED AT RECOGNIZING OUTSTANDING PROJECTS ALIGNED WITH THE SIX DIMENSIONS OF STAKEHOLDER'S PERFORMANCE THAT GO BEYOND FINANCIAL RESULTS.
THE WINNING INITIATIVES INCLUDED THE ELECTRICIAN SCHOOL FOR WOMEN, A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN EDP AND SENAI (NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL LEARNING SERVICE), FOCUSED ON TRAINING WOMEN TO WORK AS ELECTRICIANS IN THE DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS.

VALUATION OF DIVERSITY GRI 103 | 405 Valuing diversity and promoting inclusion are ethical imperatives that reaffirm the human dimension of the company and represent the EDP culture in practice. In this respect, one of the main highlights during the year was the official launch of the Inclusion & Diversity Program, with the creation of a governance structure comprising an Executive Committee, a National Committee and six Affinity Groups: Gender Equality, Disabled People, Race, Generations, LGBTI+ and Cultures & Spiritualities. During the course of 2019, these groups, formed by employee volunteers, prepared action plans to address some of the main diversity and inclusion challenges in the company. This led to the approval of a roadmap that will guide the groups’ actions over the coming years.
The company’s first Diversity Week was also held during the year, with speakers and professionals who debated different aspects of diversity. In October, employees had the opportunity to participate in a program with diverse actions that took place simultaneously in eight locations in the states of Ceará, Espírito Santo, Rio Grande do Sul, São Paulo and Tocantins. The talks and debates were broadcast live, ensuring the content was accessible to employees all over the country.
One highlight of the event was the panel "Diversity as a competitive differential for the business", with the participation of CEOs from major multinational companies. Also worthy of note was the performance by the ECA/USP Chamber Orchestra (Ocam), together with the Mundana Refugi Orchestra, formed by refugee musicians from diverse countries.
The end of Diversity Week was marked by the announcement of EDP Brasil’s adhesion to Brazil’s Citizen Company Program (law nº 11.770/2008), which extends maternity leave from 120 to 180 days and paternity leave from 5 to 30 days – 10 days more than stipulated by law. This move reaffirmed the company’s commitment to the Women’s Empowerment Principles established by UN Women. GRI 401-3. 
EDP Brasil also formalized its target of having 30% women in its labor force by 2022, in accordance with the official positioning of the EDP Group. This target supports the company’s commitment to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5: Gender Equality, one of the nine SDGs incorporated into the EDP 2022 strategic agenda.
It also underscores the value the company attributes to inclusive leadership. In 2019, EDP Brasil invested in training to develop competencies related to diversity and inclusion, addressing subjects such as unconscious bias, decision making systems, empathy and vulnerabilities. Senior managers and the directors of EDP Agility took part in this training.
For 2020, the expectation is to extend this training to the remaining leaders and to multipliers as a means of consolidating the actions of the affinity groups and reinforcing diversity in the recruitment and selection agenda.
GATEWAY TO TRANSITION AND CAREER ENDINGGRI 103 | 404, 404-2 The EDP Brasil People Management area tracks employees from the attraction phase right through to retirement and career ending.
PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT GRI 103 | 404, 404-1 404-2 The EDP Corporate University promotes training and development initiatives aligned with company strategy and growth.
In 2019, EDP Brasil invested in developing internal multipliers to train people to gain more in-depth knowledge with special emphasis on future requirements in the company and in the industry. One example is the IMentors Program, which involves training in Design Thinking and agile methodologies, to prepare employees to act as multipliers. Additionally groups were formed in the EDP University for training in robotization and process automation in conjunction with the Digital Projects area. Further information in Innovation.
Training in the form of classroom and online courses, workshops and talks takes place throughout the year. Participation in these courses may be by selection or is open to all applicants. During the year EDP Brazil invested R$ 5.34 million in developing employees in all the wholly owned and uncontrolled companies. The total number of hours training was 168,787, an average of 51 hours per employee.
PERFORMANCE REVIEW AND RECOGNITION GRI 404-3 On an annual basis, employees are appraised in accordance with their performance in the Stakeholder's Performance, with a focus on team performance and shared targets. Additionally strategic competencies for the different job levels are evaluated, taking into account feedback meetings and the elaboration of individual development plans.
In addition to the EDP Star Award (information in EDP Agility Highlights in 2019), launched this year, the company has a Best Leaders Award, aimed at recognizing outstanding managers during the year. Since 2016, employees at director level have had a long-term variable compensation incentive program based on company stock awards.
In 2019, in addition to providing incentives for internal mobility, EDP Brasil conducted its Recruit E pilot project, to enhance efficiency in the resume sorting process. Using artificial intelligence, the purpose is to ensure a positive experience both for candidates and for managers, as well as to drive effective triage. This project will be subject to further tests with partner companies in 2020 until it is launched officially.
The gateway to the company for students on undergraduate courses is the Intern Program, which received more than 8,664 applications in 2019, of which 37 were accepted.
With respect to retirement and career ending, there is the Plan your Retirement Program, which focuses on three fronts: finance, physical and psychological well-being, and time management. Moreover, the EDP Brasil companies sponsor complementary private pension plans which are administered by the group’s Enerprev Previdência Complementar. For further information, see www.enerprev.com.br.
5.3 HEALTH AND SAFETY GRI 103 | 403, EU16. 
HEALTH AND WELL-BEING Aware of the importance of health and well-being for all employees and for society in general, in 2019 EDP Brasil created a specific area for Occupational Health and Assistance. Linked with the EDP Agility area, this is aimed at consolidating all EDP Brasil initiatives.
The Health Connection program, launched in 2018, involves a series of actions that integrate physical and mental health and well-being in the work place, monitoring and caring for the health of employees and their dependents. This encompasses healthcare campaigns, vaccinations, monitoring the performance of healthcare and dental care operators, and check-ups for executives.
With the purpose of valuing the family doctor model, there is also the EDP Dr Health program, focused on preventing diseases as opposed to just treating them. This involves a consultation by prior appointment with specialized doctors and is available for all employees and family members.
Another focus revolves around actions to promote greater balance between employees’ personal and professional lives, consolidated in the Reconcile program, which encourages the adoption of healthy habits, with incentives for sports, leisure, culture and quality of life. This initiative also includes the Social Assistance Program, which involved 10,400 consultations in 2019, an increase of 25% compared with the previous year. These included psychological treatment and advice on pensions, finances and legal questions, both for employees and dependents and former employees who are retired, an indication of the success of the campaigns to drive engagement in the program.
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY 2019 saw the restructuring of the occupational safety process. In partnership with a specialized consultancy, the company consolidated its VIVA program – Life always in first place!
Schematized as the points of a compass, the program is based on four components that orientate safety management: rules and procedures; consequences; values, beliefs and attitudes; perception of the environment. As part of these components, 12 initiatives were established to improve and reinforce the safety culture, lead by EDP senior management.
IN 2019 THE INCLUSION & DIVERSITY PROGRAM WAS OFFICIALLY LAUNCHED, WITH THE CREATION OF A GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE COMPRISING AN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, A NATIONAL COMMITTEE AND SIX AFFINITY GROUPS.

MAIN HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PROGRAM IN 2019: • Safety Committees: these establish the governance process for occupational safety at all hierarchical levels of the company. Stemming from the Executive Safety Committee, led by the CEO with the participation of the vice presidents, safety committees for each area were created. Based on these committees, periodic governance meetings were established for the management areas of all the EDP Brasil companies. Leaders at all levels discuss safety-related questions and the progress of strategic projects, as well as assessing trends in strategic indicators to take decisions focused on ensuring zero accidents.
• Critical Risk Management: in 2019, the critical risk management process was concluded in all the EDP Brasil companies, by means of the identification of hazards and assessment of occupational risks in order to apply control measures. The methodology established is aligned with best market practices and with the ISO 31.000 – Risk Management – standard. The process is monitored by all the leaders on the Safety Committees. • Accident investigation and analysis: to reinforce a culture of learning from mistakes, in 2019 the entire incident analysis and investigation process was reviewed by the corporate Occupational Safety area. This led to the definition of a single root cause identification methodology for the entire company; roles and responsibilities were also reviewed and senior management participation was incorporated into the process.
• Risk perception: the purpose of “The Risk Factor” program is to increase risk perception among EDP Brasil employees and business partners. Training was provided on the perception of risk in daily routine actions, which are frequently unconscious but can help promote safe attitudes and behavior. Selected employees became multipliers with the objective of disseminating safe practices to colleagues and business partners.
• Rules that Save Lives: in 2019, an employee consultation process was undertaken to select Rules that Save Lives for critical procedures in which faults may cause serious and/or fatal accidents. A total of eight rules were implanted; in the Distribution area a further two Rules that Save Lives were defined and will come into force in 2020.
SAFETY PERFORMANCE GRI 403-2 In 2019, there was a 46% reduction in time-off accidents in the work force (employees and business partners) compared with 2018, and there were no fatal accidents with the company’s own employees. Unfortunately, however, there was one fatality with a business partner in the Distribution area.
EDP Brasil continues to pursue the target of zero accidents among both employees and service providers. In addition to the VIVA program, other safety initiatives were undertaken during the year, such as training in legal requirements to mitigate accidents; the review of norms and the intensification of inspections to improve field processes; emergency training and simulations; training courses promoted in partnership with the EDP university; ongoing risk analyses; and interactions with the diverse teams in accordance with the activities exercised in each location.

IN ENHANCING ITS PRACTICES 6.1 WATER AND EFFLUENTS GRI 103 | 303, 103 | 306. 
Focused on the preservation and efficient use of water resources, EDP Brasil has rainwater harvesting systems installed on the roofs of the TPP Pecém administrative building, the Poá Distribution Services Center, the EDP Brasil headquarters in São Paulo and its units in Mogi das Cruzes and São José dos Campos.
The company’s gross water consumption is more relevant in thermal generation. In line with EDP Brasil’s commitment to best environmental practices, the Pecém TPP reused 31.5% of the effluent generated in the production process, resulting in a decrease in water consumption of more than 21,000 m³ per month. During the cycle, EDP Brasil consumed approximately 9.52 million m³ of water at all its business units, corresponding to a 2% increase over 2018, but a 21% reduction compared with 2017. Considering water consumption by energy generated at Pecém, in 2019 performance improved over the previous year. GRI 303-3 6.2 WASTE GRI 103 | 306 , 306-2. 
In addition to seeking to reduce the consumption of materials, the company sorts, stores, treats and disposes of its waste in an environmentally correct manner. At the Pecém TPP, approximately 83% of the ashes produced in energy generation in 2019 were reused in the cement industry, reducing the amount of non-hazardous waste disposed of in landfills by on average 45%, or approximately 77,000 tons.
As a result of this performance, the Pecém TPP received the Ceará Industry Federation FIEC 2019 Award, in the large-scale industry Cleaner Production - Recycling Projects category, for the project Highways Paved with Mineral Coal Ashes. The initiative is aimed at substituting the soil and rocks used in the base and sub-base of conventional paved highways with mineral coal ashes generated by thermal power plants.

6.3 BIODIVERSITY GRI 103 | 304, EU13. 
EDP Brasil is fully aware of the sensitivity of natural ecosystems and the pressures they are subject to, as well as the intrinsic value of initiatives aimed at protecting biodiversity. For this reason, its environmental policy establishes commitments related to biodiversity, ecosystem services and management of the impacts caused by its activities throughout the value chain.
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ON BIODIVERSITY GRI 304-2 Taking into account the fact that EDP Brasil does not currently have generation units under construction, the company understands that the main risks for biodiversity are related to the construction of Transmission and Distribution units, which involves, for example, cleaning and opening access to transmission line corridors.
Transmission Lot 7 in Maranhão is located close to areas demarcated by the land reform authority Incra (Instituto Nacional de Colonização e Reforma Agrária) and certified by the Fundação Palmares. Similarly, the extension of Lot 21, under construction in Santa Catarina, involves Full Protection Conservation Units (Unidades de Conservação de Proteção Integral), small rural properties and is close to some quilombola communities.
In the Distribution area requests for power connections and the extensive low and medium voltage power networks involve diverse types of land use and occupation in the respective municipalities, including conservation units and environmental protection zones.

MONITORING AND MITIGATING IMPACTS The company’s Environmental Policy encompasses managing biodiversity, which includes risk analysis at all the business units. The main initiative developed on a continuous basis involves aerial and fluvial monitoring of the plants’ reservoirs, monitoring of flora and fauna in the areas of the plants and in the rights of way of the transmission lines and networks in the Distribution and Transmission rural zones.
Particularly noteworthy in 2019 was the concession of installation licenses for all the transmission lines by the environmental agency Ibama (Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis) and the respective state environmental authorities ahead of schedule.
To reduce biodiversity impacts in the Distribution area, the company performs analyses during the project planning phase, particularly for the implantation of lines in sensitive areas. These analyses include the verification of the existence of conservation units, legal reserves, permanent preservation areas and native vegetation, with the objective of proposing local alternatives in which impacts are reduced or technical and technological solutions that mitigate any such impacts are employed. Such solutions include higher structures than conventional ones and the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to launch transmission cables in native vegetation and legal reserve areas, avoiding the need to suppress vegetation in the implantation and operation of the installation.
GENERATION OF SHARED VALUE GRI 304-3 In Generation, the HPP São Manoel has a Forestry Reconstitution Program involving an area of 1,174.85 hectares in permanent preservation areas (APP) in the Teles Pires river basin. A total of 467.12 hectares had been reconstituted by 2019. The plant also donated 727.45 m3 of treated timber from the suppression of vegetation for the formation of the HPP São Manoel reservoir in the municipality of Paranaíta (Mato Grosso). This timber will be used by the local government in the construction of public housing and the refurbishment of wooden bridges on access roads.
In Espírito Santo, a technical cooperation agreement has been in force for 15 years with Idaf (Instituto de Defesa Agropecuária e Florestal), to enable maintenance services in the transmission line and right of way corridors in rural areas, as well as to suppress vegetation for the construction of distribution lines and sub-stations.
The following initiatives are also worthy of note: • BOT Project – Activities in restricted areas: a pilot project was established to provide support for field teams and prevent the execution of unwarranted services in restricted areas (environmental preservation areas, irregular areas, rights of way, etc.). Based on an interface between a messaging application and the EDP Brasil Technical Information System, the system provides online guidance informing when an activity is occurring in and/or close to a restricted area and giving instructions on the measures to be taken for the work to continue.
This measure contributed to the target: 15.A - MOBILIZE AND SIGNIFICANTLY BOOST FUNDING FROM ALL SOURCES FOR THE CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABLE USE OF BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEMS.
• Community action: a new project was implemented in São Paulo with the community surrounding the right of way corridor of a distribution line in the municipality of Santa Branca (São Paulo) to provide gardening services and contain local erosion. The initiative helps preserve the environment in these areas, preventing the deposit of waste and fostering local trade.
• Environmental education: in 2019, EDP Brasil organized talks to raise awareness through local community participation in Eco-Friday, an event held in Guararema (São Paulo) for the local community, including residents, students, teachers and civil servants. The company presented its main environmental programs and measures; the execution of the Água Azul - Airport line social communication plan, which involved the distribution of information sheets to the local population about the construction work to be undertaken and the planting of trees in the Jambeiro (São Paulo) urban region.
LOCATION OF ASSETS IN PROTECTED AREAS GRI 304-1 Some EDP Brasil installations are located in areas protected by Brazilian law or considered to be of great biological importance by Conservation International.
• Plantio Brasil: in 2019 the company worked in partnership with the Espírito Santo state government supporting the national tree planting project Mutirão Nacional de Plantio de Árvores, in which more than 75% of the municipalities in the state participated. In addition to the distribution of native Atlantic Rainforest tree seedlings to the public, trees that will contribute to the reclamation of ciliary vegetation and the recuperation of springs were planted.
Generation • The Amazon: assets of the Santo Antonio do Jari, Cachoeira Caldeirão and São Manoel HPPs, which occupy 1,759.72 km² of protected areas and are prioritized for conservation. • Cerrado: all the areas of influence of the HPPs Luis Eduardo Magalhães, Peixe Angical and Mascarenhas, located in the transition zone between the Cerrado and Atlantic Rainforest regions, totaling 297.52 km².
Distribution • Atlantic Rainforest: In São Paulo, the company administers 3,861 km of transmission lines and eight sub-stations in the Atlantic Rainforest biome in federal, state and municipal conservation units, as well as protection areas and Upper Tietê basin water source reclamation areas. In Espírito Santo, there are 3,610 km of lines and eight sub-stations in conservation units in the same biome.
Transmission • Amazon: The Rancho Papouco and Morro dos Garapenses Environmental Protection Areas (APA) are partially influenced by 3.6 km of lines, totaling 23.59 km2 of area impacted. • Atlantic Rainforest: a total of 83.8 km of lines within protected areas, with an area of 6.708 km² affected in the Rio Machado; 0.276 km² in the Paraíba do Sul basin; and 3.07 km² in the Serra da Mantiqueira environmental protection areas. The lines located in Espírito Santo and Santa Catarina, both in the Atlantic Rainforest biome, are not in and do not intercept the buffer zone of the SNUC conservation units.
6.4 MANAGING EMISSIONS GRI 103 | 305, 201-2, 302-1 Due to impact on water availability, climate change is factored into company risk management and the establishment of EDP Brasil targets. The company is engaged in discussions around this topic and participates in external initiatives such as EPC (Empresas pelo Clima or Companies for the Climate), run by the Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV), and the Global Compact’s Energy and Climate Working Group.
EDP Brasil has a strategic plan focused on this issue involving the assessment of risks and opportunities and the possibility of carbon pricing, taking into account potential effects on its operations. Moreover, the company has a target of imposing a 25% limit on the share of coal in the energy generation portfolio by 2020, as well as developing projects to reduce CO2 emissions as a means of combating climate change.

reducing fleet CO2 emissions by around 70%. The company also invests in energy efficiency and the generation of photovoltaic solar energy, as well as seeking to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through operational efficiency measures and the reduction of energy distribution losses.
Externally, energy efficiency projects implemented at customers totaled energy savings of 18,285.69 MWh and, in conjunction with steam co-generation projects, avoided emissions of 29,883.97 tCO2eq. Solar energy projects have resulted in the generation of 469.17 GWh with the avoidance of 35,215.27 tCO2e in emissions during the course of their working life. GRI 302-5. 
Internally, company direct and indirect emissions totaled 4.62 million tons of CO2eq (scope 1 and scope 2), an increase of 9% compared with 2018. This was due mainly to the higher generation at the Pecém TPP, driving the scope 1 increase, and higher losses in Espírito Santo, which affected scope 2 emissions. Scope 3 emissions remained practically stable, increasing only 2% over 2018.
In 2019, the company emitted 474 tons of CO2eq /GWh generated through its assets, an increase of 23% over 2018. However in comparison with 2017, there was a 20% decrease. It should be noted that EDP Brasil has developed an internal tool to calculate GHG emissions on a monthly basis, optimizing control and management. GRI 305-5, 305-7.

MANAGING CLIMATE CHANGE To mitigate impacts related to GHG emissions, the company joined the Brazilian Climate Commitment Program (Programa Compromisso com o Clima ). The carbon credit projects available on the platform were analyzed from the perspective of socioenvironmental impacts, adherence with the company’s priority SDGs, the region where the project is in place and whether it is a REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) project. In line with this strategy, the company is committed to offsetting a total of 21,428 tCO2eq, with REDD+ credits over the next three years.
Moreover, during the year EDP Brasil remained abreast of climate change issues in the major conferences in the area, such as COP 25 and the Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019. Focused on the transition to a low carbon economy, a core topic in the conferences, EDP Brasil tracked the main developments of the PMR (Partnership Market Readiness) initiative and conducted internal studies to understand the possible impacts of carbon pricing in the Brazilian market. In addition to the transition risk, the company initiated a climate vulnerability study with a view to reviewing and enhancing its risk matrix, making the future physical impacts for the operations tangible.
