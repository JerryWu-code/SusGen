03 SK hynix TCFD Report 2022 Metrics & Targets Strategy & Risk Management Governance Introduction. 
Introduction. 
SK hynix is keenly aware that more and more stakeholders are demanding systematic and detailed disclosure of the risks and opportunities that companies face due to climate change. We also believe that transparent climate-related disclosures for stakeholders will facilitate more informed decisions, contributing to the transition to a carbon-neutral society. Accordingly, SK hynix has disclosed climate change-related information in accordance with the TCFD recommendations in our sustainability report for the past three years. Going one step further, this year we have published a stand-alone TCFD report in an effort to raise the level of our climate-related disclosures.
Our inaugural TCFD report published in 2022 contains a detailed analysis of climate-related risks and opportunities, as well as an analysis of various climate change scenarios. In particular, for climate change-related risks with high impact and likelihood, we have estimated and disclosed financial impacts quantitatively based on the scenario analysis to provide more useful information to investors.
Estimating the future impacts caused by climate change over the long-term contains a great deal of uncertainty in itself. This is because the situation continues to change according to the complex interplay of socio-economic development paths and changes in the climate system. Nonetheless, efforts to reasonably estimate the magnitude of the impacts of climate change based on currently available information play a very important role in decision-making to minimize them. This is why SK hynix transparently discloses the results of our climate change scenario analysis through the publication of this TCFD report.
We believe that this TCFD report is an important milestone in the journey of SK hynix, which pursues transparent disclosure of climate change information. We will further step up our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions toward the goal of achieving net zero by 2050 and transparently disclose the progress to facilitate the transition to a carbon-neutral society.

Our Commitment to Climate Action. 
Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is more than an “environmental protection” issue, and is becoming a “matter of survival” for businesses. At the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) held in Glasgow, UK, in 2021, countries revisited and strengthened the targets for cutting emissions by 2030 in their national plans. Major countries and companies around the world are scaling up their responses to climate change by announcing net zero targets and raising NDC ambitions. South Korea became the 14th country to legislate its commitment to become carbon neutral by 2050 as a pledge to the international community to actively respond to climate change.
In 2020, SK hynix became the first memory chip maker to join the RE100 initiative with the aim to run its operations with 100% renewable electricity by 2050. In 2021, we also announced our goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, acknowledging our immense responsibility for climate response as a leading global semiconductor company. As a first step toward achieving this goal, we plan to achieve 100% renewable energy at overseas facilities by the end of 2022, and source 33% of our total global electricity use from renewables by 2030. Furthermore, we aim to maintain our absolute GHG emissions (Scope 1 & 2) by 2030 at 2020 levels through aggressive GHG reduction activities despite a significant increase in production with the operation of the. 
Yongin Semiconductor Cluster, which is yet to be completed.
Due to the characteristics of the semiconductor industry, it is not easy to achieve net zero while operating large-scale fabs in Asia, where the share of renewable energy generation is relatively limited. This is because fabs consume enormous amounts of energy, and there is currently no existing technology to replace fluorinated gases (F-gases) which are essential for the manufacturing process. However, we believe that proactive climate action will lead to responsible business operations, the creation of new business opportunities, and the improvement of corporate value in the long term. To this end, we will faithfully implement robust climate change response measures based on solid climate change governance, and reflect the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities in our long-term management strategies to achieve our goals. As part of this effort, we established the Carbon Management Committee under the ESG. 
Management Committee in 2022, and set specific mid-term goals and action plans, including achieving 3,000 GWh of cumulative energy savings and reducing GHG emissions from process gases by 40% by 2030.
The role of semiconductors has continued to expand across areas from big data and artificial intelligence to autonomous driving. Today, the semiconductor industry is more important than ever due to the geopolitical risks triggered by the global competition for technological supremacy on top of the vulnerabilities of supply chains exposed by the pandemic. This also means semiconductor companies now have a greater responsibility to combat climate change. We will continuously improve our climate change risk management system while sharing all these processes transparently. Please follow SK hynix’s journey toward a brighter future.

Our Climate Action Timeline. 
SK hynix recognizes the significance of the impact of climate change on the global environment and humanity, and has continued to make efforts to contribute to solving those problems.
In 2020, we became the first Korean company to join RE100, pledging to use 100% renewable energy by 2050. In 2021, we announced a goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 as a company-wide vision to address climate change. At the organizational level, we have established a system to set, promote, and implement climate change strategies by creating a department dedicated to ESG strategy, the ESG Management Committee, and the Carbon Management Committee. We will seek to further solidify our position as an eco-conscious semiconductor company by maintaining Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 at 2020 levels by making all-out efforts to reduce GHG emissions continuously.

Responsible Climate Change Management. 
SK hynix management has continued to improve its internal decision-making process to mitigate climate change risks and uncover new opportunities.
First, in 2021, we launched a department dedicated to ESG strategy and created the ESG Management Committee chaired by the CEO. At monthly ESG Management Committee meetings, about 10 executives from major departments, such as Corporate Strategy & Planning, R&D, Manufacturing/Technology, and Safety Health & Environment (SHE), discuss ESG issues including climate change responses, establish concrete implementation strategies and goals, and regularly assess our progress and achievements.
In 2022, the Carbon Management Committee was formed under the ESG Management Committee with the head of Manufacturing/Technology as the chairman. The Carbon Management. 
Committee is composed of seven working groups dedicated to tasks such as setting GHG reduction targets, saving energy, and procuring renewable energy, and reports the progress to the. 
ESG Management Committee once a quarter. In addition, SK hynix operates the Climate Change Roundtable comprised of executives from marketing, finance, and other support functions such as IR/PR/CR, in addition to R&D and manufacturing. The Climate Change Roundtable analyzes climate-related risks and opportunities and their potential impact, and is responsible for pre- deliberation/review of climate-related issues that are referred to the ESG Management Committee.
“The Carbon Management Committee is a consultative body responsible for forecasting our future GHG emissions as well as establishing and implementing reduction strategies. GHG reduction efforts cannot be made independently by one particular department. All related teams must play their part systematically.
Under the Carbon Management Committee, seven working groups cover different areas including the chipmaking process, energy saving, and supply chain management. We review and update the implementation targets and check the progress of each group every month to achieve tangible reductions.”

09 SK hynix TCFD Report 2022. 
Since the impact of climate change risks and opportunities depends on business characteristics and management policies, it is very important to identify and analyze significant climate risks to our company and establish a strategy to respond to climate change. SK hynix identified key climate change risks and opportunities through a materiality assessment and analyzed the financial impact of those factors on our company. In addition, through the scenario analysis process, we selected scenarios suitable for transition/physical risk analysis, identified the financial impacts, and established mitigation measures.
SK hynix recognizes climate change as a significant risk and integrates it into enterprise risk management. In the future, we will effectively respond to climate risks by understanding the impact of climate change on our business operations and strategies through upgrading our financial impact analysis methodology.

13 SK hynix TCFD Report 2022 Metrics & Targets Strategy & Risk Management Governance Introduction. 
Climate Change Scenario Analysis. 
Process. 
We have identified the financial impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities for SK hynix, and conducted a three-step climate change scenario analysis to develop plans in response to the international community’s demand for carbon neutrality.
We have assessed the potential financial implications of each of the key risk factors with the greatest impact (“enhanced GHG emissions regulations and policies” among transition risks and “Heat waves” among physical risks). We took into account only the primary impact that is directly reflected in the income statement, and did not analyze secondary impacts (e.g., decreased revenue caused by reduced productivity due to heat waves).
The transition risk analysis is based on the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) scenarios released in June 2021 while key assumptions were made with South Korea's nationally determined contribution (NDC) targets for 2030 and 2050 carbon-neutral scenario (finalized at the Cabinet meeting in October 2021) were used for key assumptions.
The NGFS climate change scenarios are developed using the Integrated Assessment Model (IAM)1) that captures the interactions among climate change policy, the energy industry, and the macroeconomy. It is considered a credible scenario that is also used by the Bank of Korea to assess the impact of climate change transition risks on the real economy.
1) Scenario analysis in this report is based on the GCAM analysis results, which enables country-level analysis of Korea and China, where SK hynix’s plants are located, among the three IAM models used by NGFS.
Scenario application • Identify the impact on the company by scenario and develop response plans. 
Scenario selection • Classify transition risks and physical risks, and select and compose climate change scenarios that can reflect the characteristics of each risk.
Definition of key risks • Define key risks based on likelihood and impact

The actual price forecast under the emissions trading scheme may differ from the scenario forecast depending on government policies, the speed of change in the energy industry structure, and the expectations of participants. 3) The KMA developed a high-resolution detailed climate change scenario (1km) for South Korea based on a low-resolution (135 km) global climate change scenario using the standard experimental system of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) used by IPCC.

Climate Change Scenarios, KMA Climate Information Portal, http://www.climate.go.kr/home/
Furthermore, as South Korea has made carbon neutrality implementation into law (The Framework Act on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth to tackle the climate crisis), we reflected the government’s carbon neutrality plan in our key assumptions such as GHG reduction targets and emission allowance allocation plans for domestic operations. We assumed that the government would achieve the NDC targets by lowering the cap on national emission allowances allocation, and assumed the NGFS carbon price2) as the emissions trading price.
For physical risks, we use the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA)’s detailed climate change scenario for South Korea3) that applied statistical downscaling based on the Representative. 
Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenario. The RCP scenario is used in the Fifth Assessment Report (2014) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is deemed the most credible for physical risk analysis. This scenario is suitable for analyzing physical risks such as natural disasters because it directly refers to rising temperatures based on the GHG concentrations.

Results of Financial Impact Analysis. 
Many countries, including Korea, are operating an Emissions Trading system (ETS) as a policy tool to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Emission allowances are allocated to companies subject to the ETS, either for free or through auctions, and must purchase emission permits for the excess amount. As the Korean government recently raised the 2030 NDC targets and implemented a strong carbon emission regulation policy, the previously allocated carbon emission quota will likely be adjusted lower, and free allowance allocation will likely be reduced.
In line with this trend, we recognized GHG emissions as our direct and indirect costs, and analyzed the financial impact of “enhanced GHG emissions regulations and policies,” which was identified as a key transition risk. Considering the three hypothetical factors – the reduction of national emission allowances allocation, the increase in allowances through auctions, and the emissions pathways of NGFS climate scenarios, we estimated the GHG emissions that we will be responsible for based on our BAU1) emissions forecast by 2050. In order to estimate the cost burden, we used the carbon prices of the GCAM5.3 model provided by NGFS.

Based on the Net Zero 2050 scenario that takes into account South Korea's NDC targets, the financial impact of “enhanced GHG emissions regulations and policies” on SK hynix in 2030 was estimated to be 1.4% of revenue. Through this analysis, we confirmed that the GHG emissions and cost burden in the Net Zero 2050 scenario are higher than in the Below 2℃ scenario, and the transition risks and financial impacts increase as we approach 2050. We will proactively engage in reduction activities such as RE100 implementation and process gases reduction based on strategic decision-making in order to reduce the financial impact of mid- to longterm GHG emissions.

16 SK hynix TCFD Report 2022 Metrics & Targets Strategy & Risk Management Governance Introduction. 
Heat waves have increased in intensity and frequency due to climate change. Rising air and water temperatures due to heat waves are disturbing the ecosystem and directly or indirectly affect society and the economy, including the health, energy, and transportation sectors. In addition, rising outside temperatures will likely increase the cooling load of manufacturing facilities and buildings, and, in turn, raise power consumption. We defined the number of heat waves days as “the number of days in a year when the maximum daily temperature is 33℃ or higher1),” and analyzed the heat waves exposure of manufacturing sites in Korea (Icheon, Cheongju, Yongin) and China (Wuxi, Chongqing)2) based on the RCP scenario. Given that this is an analysis of mid-to long-term impacts, we included the Yongin site, which will be completed later, in the analysis.
As a result of comparing the number of heat waves days by manufacturing site and scenario with the number of heat waves days in 20103), which is the base year, both RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios in 2030 do not show a significant change with the increase or decrease of fewer than 10 days compared to the base year. However, a significant increase is expected in 2050. In particular, based on RCP 8.5 in 2050, the number of heat waves days is forecasted to increase by 30 days at the Icheon site, 24 days at the Cheongju site, 28 days at the Yongin site, 10 days at the Wuxi site, and 21 days at the Chongqing site compared to the base year.

17 SK hynix TCFD Report 2022 Metrics & Targets Strategy & Risk Management Governance Introduction. 
The financial impact was estimated based on the cost of electricity used for air conditioners and centrifugal refrigerating machines in our domestic operations caused by the increase in the number of heat waves days. The air conditioning cost was estimated by using the additional electricity required for heat waves days per air conditioner based on monthly air conditioner usage data and the number of air conditioners at each manufacturing site. The electricity cost of centrifugal refrigerating machines was estimated based on the additional electricity cost per m2 of semiconductor manufacturing facilities at each site and the total area of semiconductor manufacturing facilities at each site. The Yongin site, which is yet to be completed, was estimated based on forecasts reflecting future production plans.
Climate change scenarios are a useful tool for an organization to develop an understanding of how the risks and opportunities associated with climate change may impact its businesses and strategies over time. This means that the purpose of climate change scenario analysis is not to accurately predict the future, but to find appropriate response measures by identifying implications for uncertain future events. Since scenario analysis is based on probable hypotheses rather than a definitive future, it has its own uncertainties and limitations. This means that scenario analysis is a dynamic activity that needs to be improved continuously. As we are deeply aware of this, we will continue to improve the quality of analysis by gradually expanding the scope and level of key considerations such as major assumptions and variables required for scenario analysis.
Based on the RCP 8.5 scenario, the financial impact of the heat waves in 2030 was estimated to be 0.16% of the power cost. This shows that the additional electricity cost in summer due to heat waves accounted for a small proportion of the power cost, which is manageable. However, in order to respond to heat waves, a natural disaster, from a longterm and multifaceted perspective, we will strive to minimize the impact of heat waves on our business by continuously improving energy efficiency in our operations and building self-generation facilities at manufacturing sites in Korea.

Water Stress Analysis. 
Considering the current locations of SK hynix’s operations, the possibility of drought, one of the physical risks, is considered to be very low, so no related financial impact was analyzed in this climate change scenario analysis. However, considering the water-intensive nature of the semiconductor industry, we analyzed the exposure to water stress in our manufacturing sites in Korea and China (Icheon, Cheongju, Yongin, Wuxi, Chongqing) using the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas provided by the World Resources Institute (WRI). The water stress for the base year (1960-2014) and 2030 is divided into five ratings (Low, Low-medium, Medium-high, High, and Extremely high). We used SSP3 RCP 8.5, a pessimistic scenario that maximizes the physical risks defined by the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, for the 2030 scenario.
Sites whose water stress rating changes in 2030 compared to the base year are in Icheon, Yongin, and Wuxi. The water stress rating changes from “High” in the base year to “Low-medium” in 2030 at the Icheon site; from “Medium-high” to “High” at the Yongin site; from “Low” to “Extremely high” at the Wuxi site.
Low [<10%] Medium-high [20-40%] Low-medium [10-20%] High [40-80%] Extremely high [>80%]

SK hynix has committed to net zero emissions by 2050 and is actively promoting the use of alternative gases with lower global warming potential and the reduction of process gases used in the manufacturing process to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Recognizing the importance of managing fluorinated gases (F-gases) used in the manufacturing process, we have set goals to reduce GHG emissions from process gases such as F-gases by 40% by 2030 relative to 2020. To this end, we have assessed GHG emissions by the types of process gases and established a reduction plan for certain gases with a high contribution to emissions. For example, we are considering replacing NF3 gas, currently used in the dry cleaning process, with F2 gas that does not emit greenhouse gases.
We are also working on improving abatement systems that treat fluorinated gases while continuing to install water-free scrubbers. In 2021, we installed 25 de-NOx devices and 6 de-NH3 devices in the existing abatement systems, reducing air pollutant emissions by 74% relative to 2020. In addition, we are reviewing intensive investment in NOx reduction equipment for existing fabs that emit relatively high GHG and NOx due to aging equipment, as well as seeking to reduce the power required for the operation of scrubbers by adjusting power consumption according to the required flow rate. We plan to expand wastewater- reducing scrubbers while researching low-temperature catalytic scrubbers that are highly efficient even at low temperatures, and other low-power scrubbers that use reaction gases. We strive to develop a range of technologies to increase the scrubber’s destruction and removal treatment efficiency from the current 90% - performance measured at domestic sites as of the first half of 2022 – to 95% by 2030 across global sites.

21 SK hynix TCFD Report 2022 Metrics & Targets Strategy & Risk Management Governance Introduction. 
In 2020, SK hynix joined RE100 and announced an interim goal to “achieve 33% of its total global electricity use via renewable energy by 2030.”
SK hynix aims to run all of its manufacturing sites - both in Korea (Icheon, Cheongju) and China (Wuxi,
Chongqing) - and a subsidiary in San Jose, USA, by sourcing 100% renewable electricity by 2050. We plan to achieve our RE100 aspiration by procuring renewable energy through KEPCO’s Green Premium program, renewable energy certificates (RECs), and power purchase agreements (PPAs).
Since renewable energy purchase policies and systems vary by country and region, it is important to develop a plan specific to each region. To this end, we formed regional renewable energy task forces (TFs) in 2020 to monitor regional market conditions and policy changes. Each TF draws up a localized plan by establishing a region-specific process to inspect the procurement of renewable energy. In addition, they closely engage with the respective governments and local communities for public advocacy, and explore optimal implementation methods by continuously communicating with renewable energy generators. We plan to progress towards the goal of RE100 by 2050 by setting renewable energy implementation strategies for each site and making continuous efforts to transition to renewables.

SK hynix makes efforts towards an efficient energy management system and promotes energy efficiency through optimizing operation systems, replacing and retrofitting old equipment, changing lights to LED and more. Based on the ISO 50001 standard, we monitor the status of energy use in all sites on a real time basis by the Energy Portal and measure the energy efficiency performance with appropriate metrics. In particular, we run an Energy Conservation TF which involves six departments to actively discover and carry out energy saving items. The TF sets specific targets to save energy across the company, secures the capital investment needed to improve energy efficiency, supervises the ISO 50001 standard, and raises awareness of the need for energy-saving activities from employees. A total of 255 energy conservation items were identified in 2021, resulting in a drop in energy consumption equivalent to 1786 TJ and cost savings of approximately. 
KRW 23 billion, which surpassed the targets set at the beginning of the year. As a result, SK hynix has continuously surpassed the yearly targets for improving energy efficiency and savings since 2019.

As ESG performance is growing in importance worldwide, ESG bonds are gaining attention among those who seek to invest in related fields. The issuance of ESG bonds is expected to continue to increase as more investors are interested in ESG investing, and companies can use it as an opportunity to increase brand value while stably raising the funds necessary for ESG management.
Joining this trend, SK hynix issued a USD 1 billion green bond in January 2021, becoming the first global memory chipmaker to do so at that time. The green bond received an evaluation rating of “Robust,” which is the second-highest among the four ratings of Advanced, Robust, Limited, and Weak. This means that the environmental improvement impact of the eco-friendly projects included in the framework is clear and the investment decision-making process is well established.
Initially, we planned to raise orders worth around USD 500 million with a maturity of 10 years, but with orders of USD 5.4 billion coming from over 230 institutional investors around the world, we were able to issue a green bond with a total value of USD 1 billion. The funds raised through the green bond will be used for eco-friendly projects in four categories: (1) Sustainable water quality control, (2) Energy efficiency improvement, (3) Pollution prevention, and (4) Ecological environment creation. The categories were selected in consideration of the environmental impacts and characteristics of the semiconductor industry, which uses a large amount of energy and water.
SK hynix will closely examine the feasibility and the environmental improvement effect of eco-friendly projects utilizing green bond funds, and transparently disclose information on the use of funds and results, and unallocated amounts in a report annually available on the website. See the details and performance of the execution in 2021 in the SK hynix Green Bond Impact Report published in January 2022.

Reducing GHG Emissions Intensity. 
In the semiconductor industry, higher production naturally leads to an increase in GHG emissions. Due to the rapid increase in demand for chips during the. 
COVID-19 pandemic, our GHG emissions over the past three years have been increasing. However, our GHG emissions intensity has been continuously decreasing, so the interim goal set by the 2022 ECO vision - a 40% reduction of GHG emissions intensity relative to the 2016 BAU baseline (29.7 tCO2eq/
KRW 100 million) by 2022 - was achieved in 2021 (17.8 tCO2eq/KRW 100 million), one year ahead of the schedule. Consequently, we set new mid-term goals by 2030 such as maintaining the absolute GHG emissions at 2020 levels and reducing GHG emissions from process gases by 40% relative to the 2020 baseline. Although our production is expected to continue to expand with the operation of the Yongin cluster, we will continue to strive to cut emissions through various activities such as using lower-GWP alternatives in process gasses so that we can reduce the GHG emissions intensity by 57% by 2026 relative to the 2020 baseline.

Improving Scope 3 Emissions Disclosure. 
SK hynix considers emissions not only in our operations but also across the value chain beyond our direct control. This is why we have voluntarily disclosed information on several Scope 3 emissions categories such as overseas transportation (import and export) and waste disposal. One step further, in 2021, we focused on estimating the “emissions generated from sourcing raw materials (category 1),” which are likely to be considered significant in the upstream value chain.
The methods for calculating Scope 3 category 1 emissions can be divided into spend-based, average-data, hybrid, and supplier-specific methods depending on data types and specificity. We employed the average data method to calculate emissions from purchased raw materials by collecting data on the mass of raw materials and utilizing the relevant secondary cradle-to- gate emission factors. In order to do this, we assessed in detail each of the ingredients in products manufactured at all of our plants for the past three years, and disclosed the information in this report and our Sustainability Report 2022. Committed to transparent disclosure of information on GHG emissions, we will continue to improve the level of disclosure on Scope 3 emissions by expanding the number of assessed categories and refining calculation methods.
