Ultra Group Integrated Report 2019 1. About the report. 
The majority of the Ultra Group’s business activities are concentrated in Brazil They are important to the country’s economy and provide products and services that are essential to people’s daily lives. 
We entered 2019 with an optimistic outlook regarding the country’s economic growth and expectations of the positive effects on the business environment However, after a few months, this optimism proved to be unrealistic since progress on achieving the expected economic reforms was slow. 
Despite the low economic growth, it was a year in which the Group’s businesses evolved and they performed as expected, considering the national economic situation. 
Corporate governance is one of the pillars of the. 
Ultra Group’s management approach Important advances were made in 2019, with the renewal of the Board of Directors and the structuring of three statutory committees (People, Strategy and Audit and Risks), all with the participation of independent. 
Board Directors In addition, we implemented. 
Advisory Committees in all the businesses, thereby increasing the quality of the supervision and monitoring of their activities and results. 
We are long-term investors, with a proven track record of good business performance and a history of efficient capital allocation, focusing always on generating value for both shareholders and stakeholders in general In that respect, and in order. 
STATEMENT BY THE ADMINISTRATION. 
GRI 102-14 to continuously improve our strategy and ensure the long-term continuity of our business, in 2019, we carried out our first materiality study to identify the critical topics in environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, from the perspective of a number of different stakeholders’ groups Based on the results of this study, the priorities of the Ultra. 
Group’s Sustainability Program are being redefined. 
On another front, we intend to consolidate the various reporting initiatives in the individual businesses into a new Group reporting structure, in order to provide increased transparency and objectivity in our communications with our various stakeholder groups In this context, Ipiranga,
Ultracargo and Extrafarma have also been carrying out their respective materiality studies, and Ultragaz and Oxiteno are revising their existing parameters. 
The year 2020 began with a high level of uncertainty due to the corona-virus (COVID-19) pandemic, and we expect to see significant adverse impacts on global and Brazilian growth rates The. 
Ultra Group, based on the resilience and solidity of its businesses, intends to continue on its path of investing in the future of Brazil, while acting with transparency and integrity, and valuing its people, partners, the environment and society in general.

Market Context of Our Businesses. 
Ultragaz. 
From 2016 to 2019, the LPG market declined slightly due to the reduction in the country’s economic activity in the period, and the higher level of raw material prices, which increased the level of competition for LPG This scenario led to a reduction of 2 4% in the market in the 1st semester of 2019. 
This was followed by a growth of 1 7% in the 2nd semester, as the economic performance improved. 
In parallel, there were significant advances in the market regulation process, with important aspects being discussed such as respect for brands and the botlle requalification program for gas bottles. 
The elimination of the price differential between LPG in bottles (P13) and in bulk represented a significant milestone for the segment The expected regulatory approval permitting the use of LPG in the boiler, engines and agribusiness segments, pointed to an increase in the total market for LPG. 
Ultracargo. 
Ultracargo increased its market share in 2019, from 23% to 25%, in a market of 3 3 million m3 of static capacity The company, with a static capacity of 860 thousand m3, is now 30% larger than the next national competitor The growth in capacity in 2019 was due to the expansions of 86 thousand m3 in. 
Santos (SP) and 30 thousand m3 in Itaqui (MA)
The growth forecast for this market for the next 15 years indicated an increase to 5 7 million m3 This represents an important growth opportunity for the company in the segments of fuel handling (with a projected expansion of 5 4% p a until 2035), the chemical products value chain (increase of 2 2% p a ) and ethanol (increase of 3 9% p a ), in addition to the cabotage and export segments. 
Oxiteno. 
Oxiteno offers its customers a broad portfolio of products and solutions About 70% of the company’s contribution margin comes from its ranges of products for the specialty, surfactants and oil-chemical value chain segments. 
In recent years, Oxiteno has consistently invested resources to enhance the value of its product mix, a strategy that has significantly reduced the buiness’s dependence on commodities, which have a greater price volatility than specialty products. 
The business has diversified its sales across a number of different B2B markets, by offering solutions for a variety of manufacturers and segments, for example, agricultural inputs for the. 
Crop Solutions segment; and personal, cosmetic and household hygiene products for the Home & Personal Care segment These two segments combined represented 50% of Oxiteno’s contribution margin. 
In the Coatings segment, the company supplies inputs to paint manufacturers and, in the Oil & Gas segment, to service providers for the oil value chain. 
All Oxiteno customers are large corporates with a strong participation in global markets. 
Ipiranga. 
At the global level, the oil sector is undergoing its greatest transformation in the last 70 years, due to the pressures to decarbonize the world economy. 
However, in the case of the Brazilian fuel market, total demand is expected to continue to increase, but accompanied by an increase in the penetration of bio-fuels The pace of the transition of the energy mix for the automotive sector in Brazil is expected to be slower than for the rest of the world on average due to the significant participation of bio-fuels in the national energy mix. 
On the supply side, the transformation of the sector in Brazil will be much more profound, due to the divestment in Petrobras’ integrated system for refining and supply This has already resulted in a high level of transformation in the sector and stimulated the entrance of a large number of new players. 
New sources of supply, new business models, and greater freedom to set prices and contracts are very positive developments that will probably require a transition period of two to three years to fully consolidate. 
The simplification of taxation in the sector is of fundamental importance, as is the new regulatory model for the refining and distribution system In the next 10 years, investments in the downstream activities alone are expected to be arround. 
R$ 100 billion. 
Extrafarma. 
The size of the domestic pharmaceutical market in 2019 increased to over R$ 120 billion, a healthy rate of expansion, leveraged mainly by the aging of the population The performance varied across the different regions of the country. 
Extrafarma’s network of drugstores is concentrated in the North and Northeast regional markets, regions that registered lower growth rates than for the South and Southeast regions Another important impact on the network’s market position was the significant expansion in the number of competitors’ stores, notably in the State of Pará, its main market. 
In just one year, 80 stores were opened in Pará, well above the annual average for this market

Outlook and. 
Context 2020. 
Impacts of the new corona-virus (COVID-19) pandemic and the potential consequences on operations. 
Under Decree No 10,282/20, which regulates Law. 
No 13,979/20, the activities of the Ultra Group’s five businesses are classified as “essential” in the context of the measures adopted to face the pandemic, so Ultragaz, Ultracargo, Oxiteno, Ipiranga and Extrafarma have remained in full operation. 
For this reason, since the beginning of the crisis, we have acted in a determined manner to ensure the supply of products and the provision of services to customers, while at the same time seeking to contribute with actions to mitigate the impacts for our employees, customers, suppliers, partners and society in general. 
Our actions to assist customers included increasing payment terms and temporarily suspending the sales performance clauses in contracts with. 
Ipiranga’s resellers and franchisees Furthermore, we contributed to the national effort to combat the crisis by making donations for the construction of field hospitals and the purchase of respirators, as well as conceding discounts on fuels purchases for healthcare professionals using the Abastece Aí app, among other initiatives. 
In view of our commitments to our stakeholders and. 
Brazilian society, the Ultra Group strengthened its liquidity and cash position through additional credit facilities in a total amount of R$ 1 5 billion, with a 12-month term. 
In addition, our investment plan for 2020 was reduced by approximately 30%, as a contingency measure to preserve cash These measures were aimed at maintaining the group’s financial strength based on the information available today and will be revisited when there is more certainty as to the impacts of the current crisis. 
Additionally, the group formally suspended its financial projections for 2020 through the disclosure of a material fact on March 3rd, 2020. 
More information on the risks to the Group from the COVID-19 pandemic is available in the.

Portfolio Vision. 
As part of its strategic planning process, the Ultra. 
Group systematically assesses opportunities for the growth and / or diversification of its fields of activity, always in line with its principles and guidelines. 
This is a dynamic process, which includes reflection and analysis to design a vision for the future in the light of the existing opportunities, the potential to create value and the company’s long-term business continuity. 
For example, today we can see several opportunities for the Ultra Group to extend its operations in the oil and gas value chain It can reinforce its already important role of ensuring the supply of energy to a wide variety of customers, whether individuals or companies, and in the nearest or most remote locations in the country. 
Among the opportunities, the most important are the opening of the refining and natural gas sectors, as a result of Petrobras’ divestment commitments. 
The entry of new participants will result in a more dynamic, competitive and efficient market. 
The energy mix will gradually become cleaner, and natural gas will play a fundamental role in this transition Ultra Group has the assets and skills to enable it to be an important participant in the process of the opening of these market sectors. 
The Group also sees an opportunity to grow in the retail convenience store sector, through the expansion of its am/pm network. 
Another area of business development is to take advantage of the digital initiatives already established in the Group, such as the KM de. 
Vantagens loyalty program and the Abastece. 
Aí payments application, to grow further in this segment

In line with the succession plan for the Executive. 
Board, Décio de Sampaio Amaral was appointed. 
CEO of Ultracargo Ultra Group remains committed to build a succession pipeline of business leaders, both in the Holding and the businesses. 
The strategic planning process, initiated in 2018, was enhanced in order to address the long- term prospects of the businesses, as well as to strengthen the Ultra Group’s portfolio strategy. 
The changes in the governance structure were a fundamental factor in achieving this objective, especially due to the improved dynamics between the Advisory Committees, the Executive Board, the. 
Strategy Committee and the Board of Directors. 
The strengthening of the management and governance structure will contribute to the creation of a strong base for the long-term business continuity of the Ultra Group In 2019, there was an important process of renewal in the composition of the Board of Directors, with the election of four new members, of whom two are women, who will bring complementary experiences and skills to the organization. 
As well as the People Committee, which was set up in 2011, we created the Strategy Committee and restructured the Audit and Risk Committee, which now includes independent members of Ultrapar’s. 
Board of Directors. 
Another important initiative was the creation of. 
Advisory Committees in the businesses, formed by the CEO and CFO of Ultra Group and two external advisors, specialists in the respective sector of activity The Advisory Committees contribute to raise the quality of supervision and monitoring of each business, through a deeper analysis of strategy, investments, people and results

Since 2013, Ultragaz has monitored its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by means of an annual inventory carried out in accordance with the GHG. 
Protocol methodology, the results of which are available for consultation by stakeholders In order to monitor and manage its Scope 3 emissions, the company asked its suppliers to respond to the CDP’s Supply Chain questionnaire on climate change The company’s emission intensity decreased slightly, by 2 6%, in 2019, compared to 2018, to a level of 0 0097 tCO2e / tonne produced. 
GRI 305-4. 
In Ultracargo, the monitoring of GHG emissions is carried out directly in the terminals, where fossil fuels are burnt, either in operations (burning of vapors), in transport and travel, or in the consumption of electrical energy Deviations in processes that can lead to increased emissions are identified and addressed through its programs of: Attitude Focused Audits (AFA); Examine, Stop and Act (EPA); Stop, Evaluate, Recognize and. 
Execute (PARE); Planned Inspections; Task Cycle. 
Verification and Monitoring; and during preventive and corrective maintenance The biggest sources of GHG emissions are the burners at the Santos. 
Terminal (SP), even though they are managed for the greatest possible efficiency However, the use of these burners is one of the conditions for the approval of our environmental license and cannot changed In 2019, our emission intensity was 0 0007 tCO2e / tonne GRI 305-4. 
In Oxiteno, the Scope 1 and 2 emissions from all industrial units are key environmental performance indicators and are monitored on a monthly basis. 
The target is to reduce the emission intensity per tonne produced by 25% by 2030 (base 2008)
In 2019, the reduction was 15 4% Oxiteno’s GHG emission intensity in 2019, for Scopes 1 and 2 less.

The company’s inventory of GHG emissions was prepared according to the ISO 14064-1 standard. 
Based on a critical analysis of the indicators,
Oxiteno developed action plans to reduce its environmental impacts Since the creation of its GHG Monitoring and Reduction Program, the company has prioritized 22 opportunities for performance improvement, of which 10 have already been executed and one is in the implementation phase Since the introduction of this program until 2019, more than 650 thousand tCO2e of emissions have been avoided. 
The main sources of emissions are steam generation, ethylene oxide production and electricity consumption With respect to its need for steam generation, as an energy source for processes,
Oxiteno continues to invest in the migration towards using cleaner fuels, in addition to the optimization and reuse of the energy in waste gases from neighboring companies. 
The Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and their impacts, are generated in Oxiteno’s plants, offices and headquarters, while the Scope 3 emissions are generated in its value chain. 
In Ipiranga, an annual inventory of emissions is prepared using the GHG Protocol methodology. 
The company’s strategy for the topic is periodically reviewed, in line with best market practices The purpose is to identify and measure the company’s negative impacts in order to mitigate them Those emissions that cannot be avoided or mitigated are compensated by the purchase of carbon credits in the market By means of its Safety, Environment and Climate Change Policy, guidelines were defined for the prevention of environmental impacts and the continuous improvement of its processes In 2019, the company’s emission intensity was 0 0007 tCO2e / tonne sold, which represented a 3 8% reduction in relation to the previous year GRI 305-4. 
For over 10 years, Ipiranga has maintained a proprietary and independently audited program for the management of its GHG emissions The. 
Ipiranga Zero Carbon Program, which encompasses actions to measure, reduce and compensate GHG emissions, is based on recognized international guidelines In addition, to compensating the direct emissions from its operations and the indirect emissions from its energy consumption, the company offers its customers the option to compensate their emissions Since launching the. 
Zero Carbon Program, Ipiranga has compensated more than 310 thousand tCO2e. 
Through its association with the Brazil Green. 
Logistics Program, the company actively participates in discussions, together with other large companies, that focus on corporate social and environmental responsibility The participants seek to share, integrate, consolidate and apply knowledge to reduce the GHG emission intensity in transportation and also improve the efficiency of their logistic operations. 
Extrafarma’s initiatives in GHG emission management are focused on reducing electricity consumption and costs by monitoring and analyzing each store It conducts routine inspections of stores to evaluate the actions to be taken, and also monitors the consumption of refrigerant gases, through a maintenance plan In 2019, 83 air conditioners were retrofitted in the States of Pará,
Ceará and Maranhão, where the oldest stores in the chain are located The old and inefficient equipment was substituted by newer and more efficient models with lower energy consumption ratings (Procel A and B classes)

Each of the Ultra Group’s businesses manages its respective value chain in order to ensure that its suppliers and resellers comply with legal requirements in relation to the protection of human rights, and labor, environmental, ethical and health and safety practices. 
Ultragaz’s supply chain is directed to the acquisition, handling and storage of direct inputs, that is, gases and gas bottles (in sizes of 5, 13, 20 and 45 kg) Its two main gas products are: LPG, used as a fuel in households and commercial establishments, and in other industrial applications; and special butane, which is used, almost entirely, in the aerosol market. 
LGP is distributed through primary units (which can receive LPG through a pipeline) and secondary units (which can receive LPG by road, from the primary units) The LPG bottles are filled at these units and distributed predominantly by road to the company’s network of resellers and end customers The bottles are subjected to strict quality controls throughout the value chain, in accordance with the regulations of the National Petroleum Agency (ANP) All the filling units are subjected to a rigorous inspection and safety routine (inspection for corrosion damage and leakage) Damaged bottles may be repaired or discarded and replaced by new ones This inspection routine is performed 15 years after the date of purchase of the bottle and every 10 years thereafter GRI 102-9. 
Ultragaz has classified certain suppliers as critical to its operations These are the suppliers of materials or services that have the greatest impact on its operations The company has a differentiated management approach for these suppliers including periodic audits, and the inspection of each delivery of its products or services to the company’s plants. 
The approval process for critical suppliers requires, in addition to the normal business and compliance practices, a formal commitment in relation to social and environmental issues, and a satisfactory evaluation in its initial and periodic audits In 2019, five new suppliers were selected, taking the total number of critical suppliers to 78 GRI 308-1 | GRI 414-14. 
The company aims to develop and increase the Supplier Approval Index annually, as well as increasing the number of suppliers rated above 88 points In addition, critical suppliers are obliged to respond to the CDP’s Supply Chain questionnaire on climate change, which evaluates the management of this topic by the company After the end of the reporting cycle the company receives feedback and an action plan to be executed.

GRI 403-1. 
In the terminals that store benzene there are specific controls and management practices for aspects of occupational health and safety and the environment, and a Program for the Prevention of. 
Occupational Exposure to Benzene GRI 403-3. 
The purpose of the HSEQ approach is to prevent potential negative impacts on people, the environment, materials and processes, promote a safety culture and ensure compliance with the legal requirements applicable to the business A number of processes, procedures and tools are used to ensure that the aims are achieved, for example, the Value Contact, Safety Contact, HSE forums in various locations, Health Forums, HSEQ and. 
Ergonomics Committees, and the Angel Program, among others. 
To measure its progress in instilling a safety culture, the company uses the technique known as the Dupont™ Bradley Curve™ The most recent evaluation classified the company as being in the “Independent” stage, which is one stage below the “Interdependence” stage, the most advanced stage of safety The company will continue with investments and initiatives aiming to reach the “Interdependence” stage. 
Safety is a priority theme for Oxiteno in all the countries where it operates The company’s strategy is carried out through its Global Health, Safety and Environment Policy, which defines safety requirements based on integrated management systems (ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001) and the.

To progress to the next stage, the current action plans focus on the enhancement of preventive processes, preparation and implementation of a. 
Safety Master Plan, training of local specialists in behavioral safety tools and the training of senior management in safety culture management.

Analysis11. 
Ultragaz. 
The total volume sold decreased by 1% in 2019, reflecting a market retraction and a temporary interruption in the supply of LPG This was offset by an increase in the number of new distributors and growth in the sales of special gases. 
Net revenues at Ultragaz increased 1% in 2019, mainly due to LPG price readjustments The cost of goods sold registered a reduction of 1%, due to lower sales volume in the period. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses recorded an increase of 14% in the year due to provisions for losses on doubtful accounts in 2019 compared to a reversal in 2018. 
Ultragaz’s Ebtida amounted to R$ 536 million in 2019 Excluding the effect of the payment of a fine following the decision by the Brazilian Anti-Trust. 
Authority - CADE to reject the proposed acquisition of Liquigás in 2018, there was a year-over-year reduction of 2%, principally due to lower sales volume in the period and higher provisioning for losses on doubtful debts Considering IFRS 16 adjustments and the segregation of the Holding’s expenses, Ultragaz’s Ebtida in 2019 was R$ 587 million. 
Ultragaz invested R$ 230 million in 2019, allocated mainly to clients in the bulk segment, replacement and acquisition of gas bottles and maintenance of the logistics infrastructure and filling stations. 
Ultracargo. 
Ultracargo’s average storage volume in 2019 increased by 3% compared to 2018, mainly due to the greater volume of fuel handling in Suape (PE),
Itaqui (MA) and Santos (SP)
Net revenues grew 10% in 2019, driven by the increase in handling and contractual readjustments. 
The cost of services provided posted a growth of 11% due to higher one-off expenditures with maintenance, materials, services and payroll linked to the expansion in capacity at the Santos (SP) terminal. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses were 18% up due mainly to higher payroll expenses and the non-recurring effect of receipt of credits in 2018 relating to the incorrect collection of a port management fee in the amount of R$ 8 million. 
The other operating results line amounted to. 
R$ 62 million negative in 2019, the result of the provision for the payment of the Conduct. 
Adjustment Agreement (“TAC”), signed with the. 
Public Prosecutor’s Office in 2019 of R$ 66 million, for the implementation of actions to compensate for impacts caused to the Santos (SP) estuary following the fire at the Ultracargo terminal in 2015. 
Ultracargo reported an Ebtida of R$ 130 million in 2019, impacted by the R$ 66 million of the TAC. 
Excluding the effect of the TAC, Ultracargo’s Ebtida was R$ 196 million, a growth of 10% compared to 2018, reflecting increased handling and average price, in turn due to contractual readjustments, despite the higher costs and expenses with the startup of operations in expanded capacity at the. 
Santos terminal Considering IFRS 16 adjustments and the segregation of the Holding’s expenses,
Ebtida in 2019 was R$ 165 million. 
Ultracargo invested R$ 252 million in 2019, mainly allocated to the expansion of the Itaqui (MA) and. 
Santos (SP) terminals, the Vila do Conde (PA) terminal concession grant, the acquisition of land in. 
Santos (SP) and the adaptation and maintenance of existing infrastructure. 
Oxiteno. 
Specialty chemicals sales volume dropped 4% with lower sales across various segments due to the modest performance of the economy in Oxiteno’s. 
Latin American markets, in addition to a decrease in exports Commodities’ sales volume was 7% lower compared with 2018, when Oxiteno posted above average sales in this segment. 
Oxiteno reported net revenues 10% lower due to a 13% decline in average dollar prices, combined with lower sales volume and in spite of the 8% devaluation of the Real against the US Dollar (R$ 0 29/US$)
Cost of goods sold decreased 6% in 2019 due to a decline in US Dollar costs of raw materials particularly ethylene and palm kernel oil combined with a reduction in sales volume, attenuated by the 8% devaluation of the Real against the US Dollar (R$ 0 29/US$)
Sales, general and administrative expenses were flat in 2019, due to lower payroll expenses and international freight charges in line with the decline in volumes in the period, attenuated by the effect of the 8% devaluation of the Real against the US Dollar on expenses of the international operations. 
Oxiteno recorded an asset write-off at the. 
Venezuelan unit of R$ 14 million in 2019 due to its decision to exit local operations The mentioned amount impacted the results from disposal of property, plant and equipment line. 
Oxiteno’s Ebtida amounted to R$ 197 million in 2019. 
Excluding the effect of the extraordinary tax credits in the net amount of R$ 186 million in 2018 and the asset write-off at Oxiteno Andina of R$ 14 million in 2019, the reduction on an annual comparative basis was 52% due principally to the lower level of unit margins in US Dollars in the period and the decrease in sales volume

Ipiranga. 
Ipiranga’s sales volume fell 1% in 2019, reflecting greater competition in the market, especially in the large customers segment, with a decline in diesel volumes of 4%, attenuated by an increase of 3% in fuel for light vehicles (Otto cycle) Ethanol sales volume recorded growth of 14%, while gasoline volumes were off 3%
Net revenues at Ipiranga declined 1%, principally due to lower sales volume Cost of goods sold was also down by 1%, due to oscillations in the average unit prices of fuels. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses fell 3%, due mainly to management initiatives to reduce costs and expenses, notably freight, provisioning for losses on doubtful accounts and marketing programs in addition to lower expenses at ICONIC, where additional expenses were incurred in 2018 with the integration of the businesses. 
Other operating results increased 50%, mainly reflecting extraordinary PIS/COFINS tax credits registered in 2019. 
Ipiranga’s Ebtida in 2019 amounted to R$ 2,231 million, a year-over-year growth of 9%, mainly due to the reduction in expenses and non-recurring. 
PIS/COFINS tax credits Considering IFRS 16 adjustments and the segregation of the Holding’s expenses, Ipiranga’s Ebtida in 2019 was R$ 2,487 million. 
Ipiranga invested a total of R$ 738 million in 2019, allocated to maintenance and expansion of the service station and franchise network as well as expansion of the company’s logistics infrastructure.

Extrafarma. 
Extrafarma opened 29 new stores and closed 46 in 2019, a reduction of 4% in the network At the end of the period maturing stores (with three years or less of operations) accounted for 45% of the network, a reflection of the pace of expansion in recent years. 
Gross revenues increased by 2% in 2019 as a result of sales growth both in the wholesale and retail segments due mainly to the annual readjustment in medicine prices and a greater average number of stores, partially offset by the intensely competitive trading environment and the closing down of underperforming stores. 
The cost of goods sold rose 3% in 2019 due to sales growth and the annual readjustment in medicine prices Gross profit reached R$ 598 million, a drop of 1%, due to a very competitive trading environment. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses increased 6% in 2019, reflecting higher levels of depreciation, following investments made in recent years and the impact of closing down underperforming stores Excluding these effects, sales, general and administrative expenses would have risen 4% year-over-year. 
The other operating results totaled R$ 31 million in 2019, largely due to the booking of non-recurring. 
PIS/COFINS tax credits and credits arising from social security contributions. 
Extrafarma recorded the write-off of investments due to the closing of stores in the amount of R$ 19 million, which impacted result from disposal of plant property and equipment.

Ebtida at Extrafarma amounted to R$ 660 million negative Excluding the effects of impairment and the closing of underperforming stores, Ebtida would be R$ 47 million negative, in line with the same item for 2018, a function mainly of the effects related to the stabilization of the new retailing system in 2018 and non-recurring credits in 2019, attenuated by the competitive environment Considering. 
IFRS 16 adjustments and the segregation of the. 
Holding’s expenses, Ebtida in 2019 would have been R$ 566 million negative or R$ 47 million, excluding impairment charges and the write-off of investments. 
Extrafarma invested R$ 89 million in the year The amount was allocated in large part to the new distribution center in São Paulo – unveiled in August – translating into reduced logistics expenses and a better level of service for operations in the state. 
Investment was also expended on store opening and remodeling together with IT projects
