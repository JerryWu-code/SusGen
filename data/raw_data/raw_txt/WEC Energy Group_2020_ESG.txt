Priority sustainability issues. 
We recognize that an informed sustainability strategy is critical to delivering long-term business value.
In 2020, we concluded an in-depth assessment to identify the sustainability issues that are most important to our company and our stakeholders, considering both current and potential long-term impacts. This comprehensive assessment strengthened our existing commitment to sustainability and established a foundation upon which to develop programs that address these priority sustainability issues.
The Electric Power Research Institute conducted the assessment, using a methodology that had been developed and refined through previous research projects. It defined sustainability as the way our company balances economic, environmental and social issues and decisions to support the long-term viability of our business, the community and the environment. The assessment took place in four phases over seven months, incorporating industry research as well as feedback from:
Internal stakeholders, including executive leadership and select employees from across the organization, both management and represented.
Key external stakeholders, including regulators, investors, nongovernmental organizations, customers, academic institutions and suppliers.
We are using the results of this project to develop strategies and drive changes to meet and exceed stakeholder expectations. Our priority sustainability issues also are helping us to structure our sustainability disclosure, including this report, and ongoing stakeholder engagement.
The following pages present the priority sustainability issues and definitions resulting from our assessment, as well as the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals (UN SDGs) they support.
Delivering reliable, affordable energy to our customers, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and building and maintaining safe, resilient infrastructure are central to our business. These commitments align directly with three of the UN SDGs: affordable and clean energy (Goal 7); industry, innovation and infrastructure (Goal 9); and climate action (Goal 13). In addition, we have programs and initiatives in place that promote local improvements related to seven other development areas.

Operational performance. 
Our 2021-2025 ESG progress plan. 
Investing in renewable and low-carbon energy inside and outside our traditional footprint to replace less efficient, fossil-fueled generation.
Modernizing our electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure to enhance reliability and resilience.
Expanding our regulated natural gas infrastructure to meet growing customer demand.
Launching advanced metering functionality and upgrading systems and equipment.
Investing in zero-carbon generation. 
We follow an asset management strategy that focuses on investing in and acquiring assets consistent with our strategic plans. In recent years, improving renewable technologies and economics have allowed us to make cost-effective investments in wind and solar generation. These investments support our greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals while preserving fuel diversity and affordable energy rates.
Renewable energy investments We have received approval to invest in 300 MW of utility-scale solar within our Wisconsin segment. WPS has partnered with an unaffiliated utility to construct two solar projects in Wisconsin: Two Creeks Solar Park, now in service, and Badger Hollow Solar Park I, targeted for completion in summer 2021. WPS owns 100 MW of Two Creeks and will own 100 MW of Badger Hollow I for a total of 200 MW. We Energies has partnered with an unaffiliated utility to construct Badger Hollow Solar Park II, which is expected to enter commercial operation in December 2022. Upon construction, We Energies will own 100 MW of the output of this project.
We have filed for approval of additional renewable projects in Wisconsin, including solar, battery storage and wind.
WEC Infrastructure Through our WEC Infrastructure business, we have acquired or agreed to acquire majority interests in seven wind farms, capable of providing approximately 1.3 gigawatts of carbon-free energy in total. Our 20212025 capital plan includes $2.2 billion of investment in renewable energy generation by WEC Infrastructure. This investment will build upon the $1.2 billion that WEC Infrastructure invested through 2020 in wind farm development. These renewable energy assets have long-term agreements with investment-grade customers outside our traditional service areas.

Improving technology and processes. 
Our companies are focused on delivering exceptional customer care while integrating and improving business processes. Employees work to provide the best value for customers by embracing constructive change, leveraging their capabilities and expertise, and using creative solutions. We expect these efforts to continue to drive operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
Enhancing customer experience across companies A multiyear effort is driving a standardized, seamless approach to digital customer service across WEC Energy Group. We now have moved all utilities to a common platform for all customer service functions, including billing, meter reading, credit and collections, and field operations. We rolled out our final customer app in early 2021, and we are now focused on enhancing app functionality for all utilities.
Using common systems and processes reduces costs, provides greater flexibility and enhances the consistent delivery of exceptional service to customers.
Advanced metering infrastructure Across our companies, we are making progress on our program to replace meter-reading equipment on both our network and customer property. An integrated system of smart meters, communication networks and data management programs enables two-way communication between our energy companies and their customers. This program enhances outage management capabilities and reduces the manual effort and cost for disconnection and reconnection. In the future, smart meters may provide customers with more usage- and demand-based billing and energy management options.
The percentage of our electric customers with smart meters reached 89% in 2020.
Strengthening energy delivery infrastructure. 
We are committed to ensuring electric and natural gas reliability while maintaining the safety and integrity of our system. We have made significant reliability- and resiliency-related investments in recent years, and plan to continue strengthening our generation fleet and distribution networks.
System Modernization Program Peoples Gas expects to continue investing between $280 million and $300 million annually in a program to modernize approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago’s aging natural gas pipeline. Dated cast and ductile iron pipes and facilities in the natural gas delivery system are being replaced with polyethylene pipes for long-term system safety, reliability and reduced methane emissions. The program also involves upgrading the system from low-pressure to medium-pressure operation to minimize the chance of explosion or fire.
Peoples Gas spends more than $50 million annually with businesses owned by minorities, women and veterans as part of its System Modernization Program.
System Modernization and Reliability Project (SMRP) Wisconsin Public Service (WPS) continues work on this multiyear project to modernize parts of its electric distribution system by burying or upgrading lines. The project focuses on electric lines that currently have the lowest reliability in the WPS system, primarily in heavily forested, rural areas. WPS expects to invest approximately $430 million in total on these improvements from the project’s beginning in 2014 through 2022. It will result in the installation of more than 2,000 miles of underground circuits in place of overhead lines and the addition of distribution automation equipment on 400 miles of lines.
Liquefied natural gas facilities Extreme weather conditions in recent years have shown Wisconsin needs more natural gas peaking capacity at the highest demand times on the coldest days. To meet this demand and keep our customers safe and warm, We Energies is progressing through the approval process to build two liquefied natural gas facilities. Each facility would provide 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas supply to meet peak demand without requiring the construction of additional interstate pipeline capacity. If approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, the total cost of both projects is expected to be approximately $370 million, with commercial operation targeted for the end of 2023.

Our approach to environmental governance. 
Our governance structure and practices support a strategic focus on environmental issues.
Senior management has primary responsibility for managing risk across the corporation. The team addresses this responsibility using a multifaceted approach that seeks input from internal resources and industry experts.
The company’s vice president — environmental, in collaboration with members of her team, takes the lead on analyzing the climate-related impacts of our strategies and related tactics. The WEC Infrastructure and Fuels team and Environmental team engage with other functional areas of the company to identify cost-effective options for reducing carbon dioxide and other emissions. The vice president — environmental provides regular updates on environmental issues, including regulatory matters, to the Audit and Oversight Committee of our board of directors through formal quarterly reports.
The Audit and Oversight Committee assists the board of directors in overseeing our strategy and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The committee’s efforts include reviewing and providing oversight of environmental compliance matters and risks to ensure appropriate management attention. Broader environmental risk oversight remains the responsibility of the full board.
Our Environmental team also provides reports at meetings of the Climate Risk Committee, which brings together senior-level officers responsible for overall corporate strategy. The committee meets at least quarterly to discuss goals and initiatives that involve climate-related risks and opportunities.
Working with external organizations and our internal staff, Environmental leadership anticipates and prepares for policy developments at various levels. Leadership further engages with policymakers and other stakeholders to improve transparency and results. These efforts help us identify opportunities for research, development, demonstration, collaboration, investment and piloting.
We actively participate in industry organizations that are involved in the legislative and regulatory processes focusing on climate change and other environmental matters, including Edison Electric Institute, American Gas Association and affiliated organizations. We also collaborate on scientific and technical work with organizations such as the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and Gas Technology Institute (GTI) to inform company planning, risk management and operations.
Our companies are subject to extensive state and federal environmental regulations affecting our operations, and we dedicate significant expenditures to complying with these requirements, including expenditures for pollution-control equipment, environmental monitoring, emissions fees, and permits at all our regulated facilities. Overall responsibility for environmental compliance lies within our operating units with assistance from the Environmental department staff. To ensure ongoing compliance, the Environmental department has dedicated subject matter experts assigned to major facilities to monitor compliance and routinely evaluate performance, and uses environmental compliance software tools. Any potential compliance issues are tracked and summarized monthly.
The company’s Audit Services department annually performs an enterprise risk assessment. This assessment reviews corporate enterprise risks and risk mitigation measures, which include the environmental area. From this risk assessment, in combination with department input and past audit experience, the annual corporate audit plan is created and approved by the Audit and Oversight Committee of the board of directors. The annual audit plan has included a number of audits reviewing various environmental processes over the past three years. These audits are more than compliance checklists, as they cover the entire process and identify instances where risk mitigation can be improved. All audit observations and recommendations are communicated to senior management and tracked for completion. These management action plans to mitigate risk are also reported to the Audit and Oversight Committee.
Our energy companies’ environmental emergency response process includes spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, as well as contingency plans, off-site plans and site emergency response plans. An environmental incident response team is on call 24/7 to provide assistance with response to spills and incidents throughout our service areas.

Managing environmental impacts. 
Throughout our operations, we work to mitigate the impacts of our business on the air, water and land.
Air emission reductions. 
Air quality control systems and other measures at our facilities have resulted in combined sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and mercury (Hg) emissions reductions of greater than 90% when compared to 2000 emissions. As we carry out our generation reshaping plan and retire less-efficient fossil-fueled generation, we continue to improve our performance in this area. Between 2019 and 2020 alone, our SO2 and NOx emissions decreased by 40% and 17%, respectively. Innovative technology at our electric generation facilities supports our progress: • At Weston Power Plant Unit 3, the ReACT® (Regenerative Activated Coke Technology) system complements the fabric filters, low NOx burners and separated over-fire air system, and mercury control system. Weston Unit 4 is equipped with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system, powdered activated carbon system, dry scrubber and fabric filter baghouse. The result has been significant reductions in SO2, NOx, mercury, particulate matter and other emissions, with chemical additives to the coal supplies providing further mercury reductions. The air quality control technologies at Elm Road Generating Station (SCR systems, fabric filter baghouses, wet scrubbers and wet electrostatic precipitators) and Oak Creek Power Plant (SCR systems, electrostatic precipitators and wet scrubbers) have yielded substantial reductions in SO2, NOx, mercury, particulate matter and other emissions. Mercury is further reduced through chemical additives to the coal supplies at the Oak Creek site.
• The natural gas-fueled, combined-cycle combustion turbine plants at Port Washington Generating Station and Fox Energy Center are equipped with SCR and oxidation catalysts for the control of NOx, carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions.
• The Upper Michigan Energy Resources (UMERC) plants have 10 natural gas-fueled reciprocating internal combustion engines equipped with state-of-the-art air quality control systems, including SCR and oxidation catalyst for control of NOx, CO, VOC and organic hazardous air pollutants.

25 WEC ENERGY GROUP | 2020 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT. 
Water resources management. 
Our companies recycle water used in power generation and use systems that minimize consumptive water loss. Most of our power plants use open-cycle cooling systems. These systems withdraw surface water from natural cold water sources, pump the water through steam condensers to cool and condense the steam that drives turbine generators, and then return all of the cooling water to the source. For facilities with cooling towers, about 25% of the water is returned to the source, with the balance of the water loss going to the air during the evaporative cooling process.
Several of our power plants have modified water intake structures to meet new federal rules. The state regulatory agencies that implement these rules have determined that power plant intake structure modifications are the best technology available for each facility. Many of our water intake modification projects were installed well ahead of the implementation dates required by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This proactive approach minimizes environmental impacts on fish and other aquatic organisms by using intake structures that meet best technology available standards.
Fox Energy Center beneficially uses treated effluent from the Heart of the Valley Metropolitan Sewerage District to supply its process water and cooling water needs. Use of treated effluent wastewater that would otherwise be returned to the Fox River is an environmentally preferable alternative to the use of surface water or groundwater resources. Water received at the facility undergoes additional treatment for the removal of impurities such as metals, phosphorus and total suspended solids. The beneficial use of treated effluent results in a net reduction in the quantity of mercury, phosphorus and suspended solids by 65% to 75% compared to what would otherwise be discharged into the Fox River.
Since 2005, We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service (WPS) have substantially reduced combined cooling and process water use and total discharges from electric generating facilities by approximately 20%. This has been primarily due to retirements of several coal-fueled facilities, and the addition of renewable energy and natural gas-fueled facilities. There are fewer process water discharges from biomass and natural gas-fueled peaking facilities than from coal-fueled generating facilities, and there are no cooling or process water needs at the Upper Michigan Energy Resources natural gas-fueled generating stations completed in 2019, or at our wind energy or solar-powered facilities.

Waste minimization commitment. 
Waste minimization and recycling is an integral part of our corporate environmental responsibility, affecting all of our facilities. We encourage employees to be responsible for environmental stewardship by supporting our recycling and waste-reduction programs. We also participate in EPA’s WasteWise program. EPA’s WasteWise encourages organizations and businesses to achieve sustainability in their practices and reduce select industrial wastes. WasteWise is part of EPA’s sustainable materials management efforts, which promote the use and reuse of materials more productively over their entire life cycles. Waste minimization is the first step in effective use of materials, and our recycling program encourages all efforts to minimize waste — reduce, reuse and then recycle.
• Whenever possible, batteries, cylinders and chemicals are sent to other corporate locations or back to the vendor for reuse.
• When we conduct subsurface work, historical/environmental records are reviewed to determine if the site qualifies for reuse of soils as clean fill.
• Our power generation facilities occasionally generate liquids or chemicals during cleanings and other activities. We collect reusable chemicals while cleaning activities are conducted. If the chemicals are reusable, they are filtered and put back into place for reuse, sent back to the chemical manufacturers, or sent to other business groups, internally or externally, for reuse whenever possible.
• In an effort to decrease hazardous waste disposal, elemental neutralization of chemicals occurs when practicable.
• Natural gas pipeline liquids are evaluated for reuse through a fuel blending program.
• Building demolitions are designed and conducted in a manner that allows us to reuse and recycle as much material as possible, including metal, drywall, concrete and other materials.
• Individual garbage receptacles were removed from our corporate headquarters and replaced with centralized recycling/disposal locations to encourage employees to properly dispose of materials.
Effectiveness of the recycling program depends on employee participation and results in: • Reduced initial material costs by ordering only the quantity needed.
• Avoided disposal costs due to reducing the amount of material for disposal.
• Proceeds from the sale of recycled materials that help reduce the cost of operating a recycling program.

We updated and expanded the data collection process in 2019 to incorporate more potential waste streams, which are reflected in the new waste categories presented in the table. The revised methodology will allow us to better identify potential areas of improvement and annual goals. The overall percentage of waste recycled increased in 2020, and we saw several positive trends: • A significant decrease in the amount of hazardous waste generated between 2018 and 2020 (much of which was classified as nonhazardous, but not recyclable).
• Nonhazardous waste recycled tonnage consistent with 2019.
• An increase in the overall total pounds of material recycled.
In 2020, WEC Energy Group sent many types of waste for recycling. These figures are included in the waste disposal summary on the previous page: • 281,486 pounds for energy recovery and fuel blending.
• 2,922,879 pounds for other recovery and reclamation.
• 1,283,931 pounds of oils.
• 231,360 pounds of electronic waste.
• 128,239 pounds of office furniture, paper, toner and other office recyclables.
• 1,449,640 pounds of wood, pallets or poles.
• 18,104,538 pounds of electrical generation equipment, including transformers, wires, breakers, capacitors and other materials.
Over the past year, 92% of all waste generated by demolition of three power plants was recycled.

Beneficial use of combustion products. 
We Energies and WPS have several initiatives that recover and use materials produced from plant operations. We maintain highly successful research and development programs to further these efforts.
In the past 20 years, our companies have provided more than 16.14 million metric tons of combustion products for beneficial use. Most of these materials have been used as construction materials in concrete, concrete products, cement manufacturing and wallboard production, and as alternative materials to sand, gravel and crushed stone aggregates. Over the past several years, our production of combustion products has decreased as several coal units have been retired.
Gypsum and wood ash also have been beneficially used as soil amendments in agricultural applications. In 2017, we partnered with Beneficial Reuse Management to build a pellet plant in Caledonia, Wisconsin. Gypsum produced at our power plants is used to manufacture blendable pellets at this facility.
In addition to the successful use of ash and gypsum, 100% of the sulfuric acid produced at the Weston Generating Power Plant ReACT air emission control system was beneficially used in 2020. The majority of this was sold to local industrial users. WPS was the first electric company in the United States to sell sulfuric acid produced from a coal-fueled electric generating facility’s air emission control system.
We have demonstrated the performance benefits of using combustion products to replace a portion of the asphalt binder in asphaltic concrete pavement. Initial results indicate that this process can improve pavement strength and longevity in extreme weather conditions, and reduce the energy needed for production.

Annual combustion product beneficial use rates vary due to variable production quantities, cyclical market demands and material quality.
We Energies has never used any wet coal ash impoundments. The WPS Weston Power Plant site has a lined settling basin that is part of the wastewater treatment system approved by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR). According to EPA classifications for surface impoundments, the basin is “less than small” in size and represents a “low hazard potential” based on its capacity and height, location and distance to critical infrastructure. The use of the settling basin to manage bottom ash is scheduled to be terminated by the end of 2023. The bottom ash and its contact water will be removed, and the basin will be returned to service for storage of lowvolume wastewater and stormwater in accordance with Wisconsin rules and permits.

Facility design and construction impact. 
WEC Energy Group manages a large portfolio of real estate. We use sustainable features in the design, construction and facility management process to maintain an increasingly sustainable facility footprint. Items of note include:
Materials selection • During facility upgrades, flooring products are selected to be carbon neutral across the entire product life cycle.
• All lighting fixtures are LED, known to use at least 75% less energy and last 25 times longer than standard incandescent lighting.
• Furniture standards require use of responsibly designed furniture and textiles containing pre- and post-consumer recycled content and reduced content of toxic materials such as flame retardants, PFCs, PVC and formaldehyde.
Recycling waste materials • Metal scrap is collected from all remodeling and new construction job sites.
• Our Peoples Gas subsidiary has set a recycling goal of 50% at all job sites, often achieving a much higher rate of recycling (9095%).
• Electronic waste is sustainably managed and recycled.
Energy efficiency • New buildings are developed with energy conservation designed into the project to exceed either Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) or Chicago Energy Conservation Code requirements.
Water conservation • In Chicago, development projects must provide storage for 125% of the requirements of the City of Chicago’s stormwater ordinance.
• Native vegetation is used in landscaping.
• Green roofs are installed where feasible.
Employee satisfaction, health and wellness Sustainable facility design features also provide cost efficiencies and increasingly support a healthy and desirable work environment critical for recruiting competitive talent. A focus on employee health and wellness includes design features such as those listed below.
Access to natural light: • Workplace layout where enclosed offices are “inboard” while open area workstations are “outboard,” allowing increased access to daylight by all employees.
• Incorporation of natural daylight into garage spaces.
Amenities designed to promote collaboration, knowledge sharing and inclusion: • Open collaboration spaces • Work cafés • Fitness center and locker rooms with showers • Outdoor patios. 
In addition, electric vehicle charging stations are installed at all new facilities for both fleet and employee vehicles.
Green roof and outside collaboration space at Milwaukee headquarters. 
Facility impact success story — Peoples Gas. 
The following projects were certified as sustainably developed by the City of Chicago through the City’s Sustainable Development Compliance Path: • North Shop • Logistics • Central Shop • Central Business District. 
Construction of the North Shop (shown below) incorporated a subterranean stormwater detention system as large as a football field under the fleet yard. This feature is designed to slowly release water back into the city system at a restricted rate. Development at the South Shop, scheduled for early 2022, is on track to meet these requirements as well.

Stewardship. 
In support of our environmental policy, we seek to enhance the sensitive natural habitats on our companies’ properties, using sound practices to manage for multiple uses — aesthetics, biodiversity, cultural resources, forestry, recreation, water quality and wildlife.
We support stewardship efforts that reach beyond properties and across state borders. Some electric and natural gas facilities are located in protected, potentially sensitive habitats such as wetlands, grasslands, savannas and forests. When we design, maintain or upgrade facilities, environmental staff members work with project teams to avoid sensitive areas whenever possible. We also seek to protect the surrounding environment and minimize potential impacts to ecological and cultural resources.
Our companies collaborate with local, state and federal agencies during the regulatory review of our projects. Appropriate stakeholders are brought together to achieve stewardship goals through opportunities typically identified during project planning and execution of construction projects. Beneficial biodiversity and resource protection outcomes result from meeting or exceeding state and federal guidelines and regulations.
Our staff members lead several comprehensive wildlife restoration and protection efforts with the coordination and cooperation of various state and federal agencies and multiple partners. Priority goes to species and native ecosystems in the greatest need of protection, recovery and enhancement.
Each year, state database information is reviewed for thousands of projects to ensure that our construction activities do not negatively impact natural resources (e.g., wetlands, waterways or rare species) or cultural resource sites. Our employees work to avoid or minimize impacts to these resources. Careful planning and implementation during electric distribution and natural gas lateral pipeline projects have increased biodiversity through wetland and rare species habitat restoration following construction. The planning process also targets reducing effects from habitat fragmentation and affecting high-quality resources. When necessary, site surveys and construction monitoring are conducted by archeological professionals to protect the integrity of known cultural resource sites.
Through robust training programs and internal outreach, our Environmental department informs and educates thousands of company employees and contractors on environmental protection and stewardship, and managing erosion during construction projects. Through these programs, employees and contractors carry out activities that serve to enhance natural resources, protect and improve habitat, and increase biodiversity across our service areas.
Strict adherence to company procedures and state regulations for controlling sediment runoff from construction activities is enforced on thousands of miles of maintenance and construction projects annually. Company crews and contractors implement stringent best management practices to manage erosion and keep disturbed sediments contained within planned construction areas. Compliance monitoring occurs frequently to ensure these practices are followed to significantly minimize impacts to natural resources they are intended to protect.
Our companies also seek to work with the general public to increase awareness of natural resource stewardship.
Rare species conservation and biodiversity initiatives. 
Wisconsin is home to the world’s largest remaining population of the federally endangered Karner blue butterfly. Our companies have worked with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and various state agencies to develop and implement a habitat conservation plan. Efforts under this plan regularly include advanced GIS mapping systems and pre-construction surveys of suitable habitat in Wisconsin and Michigan to ensure that construction projects do not negatively affect the Karner blue butterfly.
Wild lupine is crucial to the survival of Karner blue butterflies, as they are incapable of reproducing without it. Our companies’ construction and maintenance projects remove brush along utility corridors to allow lupine to grow and thrive. We have restored more than 55 acres of butterfly habitat along a natural gas lateral corridor in west-central Wisconsin. In 2019, We Energies teamed up with the WDNR, initiating a two-year program to develop methods to monitor the butterfly population’s recovery using restored utility corridors in Wisconsin. In 2020, the company further collaborated with the WDNR to support necessary management of restored areas for decades to come.
The monarch butterfly population is in decline in North America. In collaboration with American Transmission Co. and other utilities, public agencies and others, we have participated in the development of the nationwide Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances (CCAA) on Energy and Transportation Lands program. The company is currently evaluating the option of submitting a CCAA application to enroll fee-owned lands that support monarch habitat under this program to help preserve and restore the butterfly’s population. In the meantime, we currently assess construction projects to determine if pollinator planting is appropriate during site restoration, and use native seed mixes to do so throughout our service territory.


31 WEC ENERGY GROUP | 2020 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT. 
Habitat for the slender glass lizard and phlox moth, two Wisconsin endangered species, was restored following a natural gas lateral pipeline project constructed in 2019. A conservation plan was developed with our partner biologists from the WDNR and the United States Army Installation at Fort McCoy. Nearly 40 acres of habitat were restored, including the addition of approximately 7.5 acres of voluntarily restored habitat aimed at connecting several disconnected habitat patches. Restored habitat was monitored for the first year following construction in 2020. Monitoring and management will continue for at least five years to ensure expected outcomes are achieved.
Ospreys frequently try to nest on top of utility poles, which can result in power outages and harm to the ospreys. Our companies have helped install dozens of osprey platforms in more than 30 counties in Wisconsin and Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, and, since 1980, field crews have constructed alternative nest structures for osprey breeding pairs and assisted private and public land owners in erecting nest structures in key habitat locations. These efforts support osprey recovery. More than 500 breeding pairs now live in Wisconsin alone.
While less frequent, bald eagles occasionally nest atop utility poles. When this occurs, company field crews install larger eagle nest platforms to provide alternate nest structures for the eagles to use and eliminate the hazards associated with pole-top nests. Nearly 1,700 occupied eagle nests have been documented in 71 out of 72 counties in Wisconsin, which is an increase from just 108 nests observed in 1973. Additionally, the company participates with state agencies in documenting and maintaining occupied eagle nest data associated with our 30 hydroelectric facilities. This information is used for implementing nest protection measures on the properties associated with hydroelectric projects during land management and timber harvests.
Peregrine falcons have been calling our companies’ power plants home for more than two decades. Our companies have maintained nesting boxes on power plant chimneys and rooftops. One-fifth of the peregrine falcon population in Wisconsin — about 390 birds — has been born at our companies’ power plant nesting boxes.
To help educate and raise awareness about the species, real-time viewing is available through live video streaming on our websites.
We have partnered with the WDNR to protect the spawning of muskies, white suckers and walleye at the Peshtigo Dam. In addition, we work with the WDNR and the USFWS to control the sea lamprey population. The lampreys prey on game fish in Lake Michigan and then travel upstream to spawn in the Peshtigo and Menominee rivers.
Wood turtles are a protected species living throughout much of the companies’ service areas. When a project has the potential to coincide with wood turtle habitat, we collaborate with the state endangered resources staff to take appropriate measures to avoid any impacts. If natural gas and electric projects cross corridors that are home to wood turtles, construction practices are altered and plans devised to avoid impact. We have been an active partner since 2011 with a nonprofit organization dedicated to the recovery of diminished wood turtle populations in Wisconsin.
At our utilities’ wind generating facilities, we implement strategies to reduce impacts to bird and bat populations. We complete extensive pre-construction surveys for bird populations and activity before finalizing future turbine sites. Working with the USFWS has resulted in relocating turbines to minimize possible bird impacts. When we observe bald eagles at a wind facility for more than one day, we voluntarily shut down turbine operations until the eagles have left the area. When eagles do not voluntarily leave, before resuming operations, we work with USFWS and the Department of the Interior to implement deterrents until they safely vacate the facility. We voluntarily use a method recognized by regulatory agencies and scientists to reduce impacts on bat populations: changing the blade angle to greatly slow the blade movement below the turbine cut-in speed. This does not impact renewable energy generation and helps bats avoid the turbines.
For approximately 20 years, we have partnered with state and federal agencies, nongovernmental agencies, and university researchers on efforts to restore lake sturgeon to Lake Michigan and investigate passage of lake sturgeon around hydroelectric facilities on the Menominee River.

Natural areas and wetlands. 
We support efforts to create, restore and manage native habitats and other natural features on our companies’ properties. A wide variety of flora and wildlife species, including numerous rare species, are supported on thousands of acres of actively managed company lands. The company monitors a variety of biodiversity indicators on our company lands and along natural gas and electric corridors, including fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles, butterflies, moths, bees and vegetation.
An innovative approach to meeting stringent wastewater water limits was proposed for the Paris Generating Station in 2019. The company determined converting agricultural land to native habitat as a trade for very limited phosphorus discharge from the Paris site was a very costeffective and the most environmentally beneficial approach to meet the state’s discharge limits. Through this land-use change that began in 2020, phosphorus runoff from the converted farm field has been eliminated, and pollutant reduction “credits” offset the phosphorous load from the facility. While the primary objective of the project is to improve water quality by reducing phosphorus runoff, many other ecological benefits that further support the company’s environmental policy are being achieved. These include restoring 38 acres of wetland and prairie habitat, controlling invasive species, substantially increasing biodiversity on the site, establishing critical habitat for monarch butterflies, promoting the health of honeybees and other pollinator species, boosting adjacent crop yields by locating the pollinator habitat in an agricultural setting, and increasing flood storage along a flood-prone river that bisects the site.
A unique migratory bird stopover habitat on the former south coal dock at Port Washington Generating Station was created in 2011. Through continued active management, this approximately 5-acre marsh, wet meadow and tallgrass prairie habitat continues to thrive as a migratory bird resting place along the Lake Michigan shoreline. The habitat is along a primary flight corridor in the heart of the Mississippi flyway and has had more than 120 species recorded at the site, including waterfowl, shorebirds and passerines. Created wetland and prairie habitat, having nearly 150 native plants, is used not only by the birds but also mammals, amphibians and insects, including a wide variety of pollinators. Additional prairie restoration occurred in 2019 and 2020 along a public access trail, increasing the available prairie habitat used by migratory birds and pollinator species by 20%.
Hundreds of acres of natural areas contained within our companies’ closed and active ash landfill properties are actively managed to promote biodiversity, maintain large blocks of intact natural areas, reduce the use of herbicides for managing landfill covers, and restore native communities. More than a dozen state-protected and rare species, including plants, birds and reptiles, exist at properties located in Grafton, Saukville, Caledonia and Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin. Their habitats are managed for long-term viability in efforts to maintain and expand their populations. Several properties contain ecologically significant habitats with respect to both the richness of the native species and high quality of their communities. Hundreds of native plants thrive on these properties, including over 300 species on one site alone. The integrity and health of these properties depend on active habitat management targeted at controlling invasive species, the largest threat to their natural ecosystems.
Additionally, native prairie species are used to convert landfill areas to native grasslands. The entire food chain benefits from the restored prairies, from the organisms in the soil to the hawks and owls. Seed mixes are expressly designed to include wildflowers native to local areas where plantings occur. Wildflower selection is carefully made to attract and support bees, butterflies and other pollinators. Because the properties with restored prairies are in agricultural areas, intrinsic benefits occur to adjacent agricultural lands, such as increased crop production.


33 WEC ENERGY GROUP | 2020 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT. 
Prairie restoration is targeted to reduce long-term maintenance costs associated with fertilization, mowing and herbicides used to manage undesirable weed species that occur in typical turf grass covers. Planted prairie species are deep rooted and promote drought resistance, which eliminates the need to re-establish burned out turf grasses. Another major benefit to planting prairie species on landfill properties is stormwater management. Deep-rooted prairie species absorb much more stormwater than shallow-rooted turf grasses. The greater absorption capacity of prairie plants reduces stormwater runoff occurring on the landscape.
The vegetative cover over the 80-acre closed Pulliam Ash Landfill is being transitioned from a monotype of invasive giant reed grass to a diverse native habitat along the Lake Michigan shoreline. It is located directly between two priority migratory bird stopover sites identified by the WDNR as integral components to the broader Green Bay West Shores Wildlife Area. Over 100,000 individual birds use these sites annually, including over 230 species of waterfowl, shorebirds and land birds. More than 30 of the species are listed as Species of Greatest Conservation Need. The landfill cover has been aggressively managed since 2016 to control giant reed grass in partnership with the Bay-Lake Regional Planning Commission and the EPA Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. Following the effective giant reed grass management, the landfill was seeded with a diverse native seed mix in 2018. Restoration of the site and ongoing management are aimed at developing native shoreline habitat that is complementary to the adjacent priority sites, and adds important ecological benefits of staging and resting areas for tens of thousands of migratory birds.
During closure of the Presque Isle Power Plant ash landfill in 2019, approximately 10 acres of the site were restored with native prairie seed. The diverse seed mix was selected to take root in the area’s nutrient-deficient, sandy soil and attract pollinating insects. Vegetation management is being planned and coordinated in collaboration with the Great Lakes Conservation Corps.
At several properties, native plantings are used to augment stormwater control facilities, including the installation of a green roof stormwater collection system atop a portion of our corporate headquarters. Filter strips and native buffers reduce sediment loading near some facilities, and stormwater management plans for power distribution sites are incorporating native plants. These native plantings include species that sustain local wildlife, including the monarch butterfly.
Our companies also support activities aimed at restoring habitat through controlling several dozen invasive plant and animal species such as buckthorn, Eurasian watermilfoil, garlic mustard, purple loosestrife, leafy spurge, giant reed grass, Japanese knotweed, sea lamprey, and zebra and quagga mussels, among others. We conduct research and provide ongoing support for research by others on aquatic invasive species management. In addition, we contribute resources to assist agencies and other groups that conduct invasive species surveys, manage natural areas and educate the public on invasive species. We support landmanagement activities related to invasive species identification, control and management of thousands of acres in our companies’ service areas.
Prescribed burns are used to manage approximately 150 acres of restored wetland, enhanced wetland, prairie and woodlands for invasive plant species at numerous company properties, including about 90 acres near the Elm Road Generating Station in Oak Creek, Wisconsin.
Employee volunteer projects have helped with beach cleanup and restorations, adopt-a-highway and adopt-a-trail projects and community garden cleanups. Line clearance coordinators also conduct “Plant the Right Tree in the Right Location” outreach programs with area schools and community gardens.

Manufactured gas plant remediation. 
From the early 1800s until the 1960s, gas for heating and lighting was manufactured at local plants. Offering an alternative to wood and coal, these manufactured gas plants (MGPs) prospered until more affordable and cleaner natural gas began to arrive via pipelines. WEC Energy Group subsidiaries are actively investigating and remediating environmental concerns associated with former manufactured gas plant sites throughout their service areas.
Uplands We worked closely with the EPA in 2020 to continue to remediate several Peoples Gas properties in Chicago. These projects not only improved the environment but also supported the construction of new company facilities. At the Crawford site, one of the largest MGP sites in the country, we removed 50,000 tons of impacted soil and concrete in advance of building our new Central Shop facility. At our Division Street site, located just north of downtown Chicago, we removed 72,000 tons of impacted soil and concrete as part of the second phase of a three-year project. This resulted in the construction of our new Central Business District facility, which will enhance ongoing utility operations. At our Irving Park facility, we demolished all buildings and removed 17,500 tons of impacted soil in order that the site can be sold and returned to productive use.
In addition, working with EPA, we built the first phase of a groundwater treatment system in Waukegan, Illinois, to remediate impacts from underneath the former North Shore Gas South Plant MGP site. Along with the EPA, we are working closely with adjacent landowners and local government to ensure the work is performed with minimal disruption to business in the surrounding area.
In Wisconsin, we continued to work with other responsible parties, in conjunction with oversight from the EPA and the WDNR, to investigate and clean up the former Milwaukee Solvay Coke and Gas site. In 2020, we completed extensive site cleanup activities including treating 235,000 cubic yards of MGP waste through in-situ soil stabilization technology. In August 2020, we completed the sale of the majority of the property to Komatsu Mining Corp., which began construction of its new corporate headquarters and state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. We also executed an easement with the City of Milwaukee for construction of a shoreline riverwalk along the entire shoreline of the property.
We completed a leasing agreement with the City of Appleton that clears the way for the 2021 expansion of the Ellen Kort Peace Park along Water Street on the Fox River waterfront. This project will make vacant private land (formerly an MGP site) available for public use and enjoyment.
In Austin, Minnesota, we performed urban prairie management at our former Austin MGP site, which we completed remediating in 2019. This work included removal of invasive species to encourage natural growth, spot seeding, and strategic mowing to replicate a “burn” event to promote additional growth and resilience of vegetation. Our remediation work here was publicly recognized at an online event by the City of Austin and Minnesota Pollution Control Agency in November 2020.
In addition to our work on MGP sites, in late 2020, we mobilized to initiate a soil and groundwater remediation in conjunction with a company facility upgrade project at our Metro North Service Center in Milwaukee. This will address historic impacts that predated the company’s ownership of the property.
Sediments In 2020, we completed a voluntary early remedial action of contaminated sediment related to the former Green Bay MGP site at the confluence of the Lower Fox and East rivers. Through this effort, which we began in 2018, we removed all soft sediment and clay with observed MGP residuals and placed an amended armored cap over MGP residuals that could not be removed due to shoreline stability concerns.
In January 2020, as one of five nonfederal sponsors, we signed on to a Great Lakes Legacy Act project agreement for investigation and remedial design of the Milwaukee Estuary Area of Concern (AOC). Upon completing the remedial construction, We Energies’ in-kind contribution to this project agreement will leverage millions of dollars in federal funding to advance cleanup of legacy sediments sites throughout the Milwaukee Estuary AOC.
Redevelopment includes unique substation. 
We Energies constructed the Juneautown Substation in the Historic Third Ward with a goal of improving electric-service reliability in downtown Milwaukee. The underground concrete-encased structure is in the base of a new multi-use 60-unit apartment building. Before construction, we remediated historic site impacts to prevent future potential exposure. The substation now serves over 3,000 commercial, governmental and residential customers, including Henry Maier Festival Park — home of the Summerfest music festival — and large high-rise buildings east of the Milwaukee River.

Climate strategy. 
We are committed to ensuring customers have the energy they need, operating in an environmentally responsible manner and making renewable energy a key part of our energy mix.
Our long-standing focus on environmental stewardship is fundamental to our obligation to deliver long-term value to stockholders and customers. We evaluate environmental impacts and environmental regulations, including regulation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, in all facets of our strategic business planning.
Consideration of climate change is integral to our approach, and we have conducted scenario analyses to assess the strength of our strategy. We continue to reshape our portfolio of electric generation facilities and modernize our infrastructure to improve environmental performance. Our largest electric utilities, We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service (WPS), met Wisconsin’s renewable portfolio standard well in advance of the state deadline, and we intend to go further. We are committed to reducing GHG emissions from our system while maintaining the reliability that is a cornerstone of our business model.
We also support efforts to reduce GHG emissions from transportation. In August 2020, under the auspices of Edison Electric Institute (EEI), we joined our utility peers across the nation in setting sustainability goals for our vehicle fleet across WEC Energy Group. By 2025, we will aim for 35% of our car and SUV purchases and 25% of Class 3 truck purchases to be plug-in electric vehicles, and will aim to electrify 40% of our storeroom equipment, increasing this share to 75% by 2030. We already have installed 58 charging stations with 114 charging ports across our service areas, including 50 charging ports available for public use.
We have worked to reduce the role coal generation plays in our system, and in place of coal, we have built state-of-the-art natural gas generation and invested in cost-effective zero-carbon generation. We expect our utilities to spend $1.9 billion between 2021 and 2025 to increase the amount of renewable generation we deliver to our customers. In addition, we continue to invest in renewable generation outside our regulated utility footprint to serve other companies through long-term offtake agreements.
In June 2021, Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approved electric vehicle (EV) charging pilot programs for residential and commercial customers through our We Energies and WPS utilities. With the programs, we will install EV charging equipment and supporting electric distribution infrastructure in our Wisconsin electric service territories through 2026.
58 charging stations 114 charging ports 50 are for public use purchases to be electric by 2025.

Sustainable customer programs. 
We offer options to electric customers who want to help strengthen the market for renewable energy.
When our We Energies customers participate in the Energy for Tomorrow® program at the 25%, 50% or 100% level, We Energies produces or purchases renewable energy to match that percentage of their electricity use. Energy for Tomorrow is Green-e certified and meets the environmental and consumer protection standards set by the nonprofit Center for Resource Solutions. The NatureWise® program at WPS similarly offers customers the opportunity to purchase specified amounts of electricity from renewable sources. In 2020, these programs resulted in 65,079 metric tons of avoided carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions.
In addition, for more than two decades, WPS has implemented SolarWise for Schools, an awardwinning solar and renewable energy education program for high schools in the WPS service area. SolarWise schools receive a 2-kilowatt solar energy system installed at the school, a hands-on renewable energy curriculum, and teacher training to integrate curriculum materials into existing courses. Students from participating schools also are invited to compete in the Solar Olympics, sponsored annually by WPS, which celebrated their 25th year in 2021.

Carbon dioxide emissions reduction. 
Our generation transition efforts are achieving strong results. We exceeded our 40% carbon dioxide reduction goal in 2019, well in advance of our 2030 target.
We re-evaluated our carbon reduction goals for our electric generation fleet in light of this progress.
As strategies to reduce GHG emissions continue to evolve, we are committed to working with elected officials, regulatory agencies, customers, environmental groups and other stakeholders to achieve a 60% reduction in carbon emissions from our generation fleet by 2025 and an 80% reduction by the end of 2030, below 2005 levels. Our long-term goal is to be net carbon neutral by 2050.
Our plan for achieving these goals assumes that certain older, fossil-fueled generation will be replaced with carbon-free or lower-emitting resources. Emissions attributed to newer, more efficient power plants may be offset with carbon-free resources or other carbon reduction techniques.
We look forward to working with our stakeholders to develop policies that will enable us to achieve our new goals.
Taken as a whole, changes to our generation fleet are expected to reduce costs to customers, preserve fuel diversity and reduce carbon emissions.
Supporting communities on the path to carbon neutrality Our planned generation changes have the potential to affect our workforce and our communities. We recognize the importance of addressing social and economic as well as environmental impacts for a just transition to a cleaner energy future. In closing power plants, we have followed the processes outlined in applicable policies, plans and collective bargaining agreements, and worked with local union leadership to relocate employees or offer severance benefits. We also have offered outplacement assistance to employees. Our charitable giving programs support communities across our service areas, and through our foundations, we have donated to economic development efforts in counties where we retired plants.
As we carry out our plan to reduce carbon emissions, we will continue to work hand in hand with our stakeholders to minimize the impact of plant retirements. We also will look to the recommendations of the “Just Transition” framework, which is focused on the well-being of workers and communities, and related climate justice efforts to inform our engagement and decisionmaking.

Methane emissions reduction. 
In May 2019, we announced a goal across our energy companies to reduce the rate of methane emissions from our natural gas distribution lines by 30% per mile by 2030, from a 2011 baseline. At the end of 2020, we were more than halfway toward achieving that goal. Building on that progress, in May 2021, we announced a new goal — to achieve net-zero methane emissions from our natural gas distribution system by the end of 2030.
Methane, a short-lived and potent GHG, is emitted during the production and transportation of natural gas, coal and oil. Because we are a major distributor of natural gas in the Midwest, methane reduction efforts are central to our environmental performance. We plan to achieve our net-zero goal through an effort that includes both continuous operational improvements and equipment upgrades, as well as the use of renewable natural gas throughout our utility systems.
Key to this effort, our Peoples Gas subsidiary is working to replace approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago’s natural gas pipeline infrastructure, switching dated cast and ductile iron pipes with modern polyethylene pipes. As part of this program, we have made voluntary commitments as a Founding Partner in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) Methane Challenge.
For 2020, we reported emissions of approximately 27.0 million metric tons of CO2e to the EPA related to our natural gas distribution business: approximately 98.5% of this amount was from our customers’ use of natural gas (those customers without their own reporting requirements), and the remainder was from distribution system leaks.

41 WEC ENERGY GROUP | 2020 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT. 
Looking to the future of natural gas. 
Electrification has been discussed in our industry as a possible means of reducing methane emissions from the use of natural gas. To stay informed of the latest developments, we actively participate in industry collaboratives and national initiatives for sharing information and best practices. For example, upon its founding in 2020, we signed on as participants in the Low-Carbon Resources Initiative, a joint effort from the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the Gas Technology Institute.
At this time, given the state of the technology and the specific conditions of our service areas, we see more potential in other options for reaching net-zero methane emissions. Continued electrification of space and water heating could play a role in reducing the emissions from natural gas use over the long term. Today, however, electric heat pumps are four to five times more costly than natural gas heating in our region. The distribution system remains essential to serving our customers, especially during the Midwest’s cold winters.
As an alternative to electrification, the industry is looking at opportunities to blend renewable natural gas from dairy farms and other sources with conventional natural gas, reducing the carbon intensity of natural gas supplies. This is our planned approach as we work toward our methane reduction goal. It suits our business especially well due to the strong dairy industry in our region.
In addition, hydrogen is getting increased attention as a promising longer-term strategy. There is potential for hydrogen to be produced with zero-emission energy resources and blended with conventional natural gas. If this technology becomes a viable option for our companies, we expect our modernized natural gas system could be modified to carry hydrogen fuel.
Our ongoing engagement with industry peers and research initiatives will help us apply new technologies as they become suited to our needs.
“ A merciless cold lingers in the Midwest”
This was just one of the many news headlines in January 2019 as record-setting cold, descending from the Arctic, blanketed much of the Midwest. More recently, in February 2021, a week-long cold snap sent temperatures plummeting and raised demand for energy during an otherwise mild winter. Our people and infrastructure were put to the test and performed remarkably, even as temperatures dropped to minus 42 degrees Fahrenheit in the northern portion of our service area.
These cold weather events, which can persist for days, highlight one of the challenges the region faces as we integrate higher levels of renewable energy technologies. Moving forward with renewable resources, we need to consider extreme weather and winter peaks common to our service areas. Our natural gas peaking facilities are important to help meet our demand during the winter season. Renewable resources may not be able to generate and store enough power for the foreseeable future, so our peaking units will continue to be part of our transition to meeting our carbon goals.
We plan to continue to look at alternative options, such as battery storage, to help mitigate the need for peaking plants in the future. We also are contributing to research to address cold weather challenges of electrifying vehicles and buildings. Batteries are less efficient at low temperatures, so additional charging is required during cold winter months. Heat pumps are also less efficient in extreme cold weather, but research continues to show promise. These issues can be managed in a variety of ways, but represent one of the unique challenges in the region.
Electric heat pumps are four to five times more costly than natural gas heating in our region.

Assessing risks and opportunities. 
Changing climate conditions, potential policy measures and the technology changes reshaping the U.S. energy sector pose risks and opportunities for WEC Energy Group that vary significantly by business segment. Our strategic planning processes enable our companies to continuously evaluate these uncertainties in the context of maintaining reliable, affordable energy supplies for our customers that follow the environmental improvement trajectory that we have set.
Scenario and goal analysis In May 2021, we issued our updated climate report, Pathway to a Cleaner Energy Future, to reflect our evolving plans and goals. The report focuses on the risks and opportunities associated with transitioning to a low-carbon economy, based upon the modeling of dozens of potential emission reduction pathways. It builds upon industry-specific research from EPRI and global emissions scenarios used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
As detailed in our first climate report, published in 2019, we evaluated long-term emissions reduction scenarios for the region and the state of Wisconsin, home to our largest utility operations. This assessment helped us better understand how the region’s economy and our own carbon profile could be affected by a wide range of variables, including GHG reduction targets, natural gas and other fuel prices, and technology availability and costs. It identified cost-effective and resilient strategies for producing and using clean energy, resulting in reduced GHG emissions at our electric companies.
Our analysis supports our current emissions reduction trajectory while demonstrating the importance of technological and market innovation in the years ahead. We see the potential for economywide emissions reductions through electrification, which our electric companies could help facilitate. As our updated goals demonstrate, we continue to evaluate climate-related risks and opportunities and update our approach as technology, policy and markets evolve. Our new GHG reduction goals described on Page 39 further support the call by the IPCC for even deeper GHG reductions. Our midterm goals exceed the global benchmark discussed in the IPCC report and are aligned with the more aggressive reduction pathways for the U.S. electric power sector embedded in global climate scenarios that are consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement.
Helpful points of reference include the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) from the World Energy Outlook, and the 2 Degree Scenario (2DS) and Beyond 2 Degree Scenario (B2DS) from the Energy Technology Perspectives. By 2030, IEA projects that the average global carbon intensity (CO2 emissions per megawatt-hour of electricity production) will decline to roughly 0.23 metric tons of CO2 per megawatt-hour (metric tons/MWh) in the B2DS scenario and the 2DS scenario. By comparison, we estimate a carbon intensity of 0.17 metric tons/MWh for our operations by 2030, as we work toward our 80% reduction goal.
Regulation of GHG emissions from fossil fuel sources Current and potential GHG emissions regulation carries with it a wide range of possible effects on our energy business. As a result, we strive for flexibility in reacting to the variety of potential outcomes to ensure a secure, low-cost and reliable supply of fuel for generating needs. Our electric energy companies build adaptability into fuel supply and transportation contracts to address climate change regulation.
We are continuing to analyze the GHG emission profile of our electric generation resources and to work with other stakeholders to determine the potential impacts to our operations of federal and state GHG regulations. We also are engaged with Wisconsin agencies, organizations and other stakeholders as participants on the Governor’s Task Force on Climate Change.

Innovation. 
We continue to improve the efficiency and environmental impact of our operations through new technology and research.
Since 2006, we have invested nearly $6 million in climate change research and development programs through in-house work and membership in the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). Through EPRI and elsewhere, we have made other investments related to renewable energy and demand-side energy efficiency that also may reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
Peoples Gas has partnered with the Gas Technology Institute (GTI) since 1985, and has invested more than $9 million in research, innovation and development. The research has brought technologies to the natural gas industry that have benefited customers and employees through improved safety, operational efficiencies, reduced environmental impacts and increased energy efficiency.
In 2020, WEC Energy Group joined EPRI and GTI’s Low-Carbon Resources Initiative, which will focus on large-scale deployment of low-carbon technologies. The five-year initiative plans to: • Identify and accelerate development of promising technologies, including hydrogen, bioenergy, carbon capture and renewable natural gas.
• Demonstrate and assess the performance of key technologies and processes and identify possible improvements.
• Inform key stakeholders and the public about technology options and potential pathways to a low-carbon future.
This research and development effort will help to inform our longerterm strategy to address the emissions from our natural gas-fueled power plants and natural gas distribution system.
Renewable energy programs Two innovative renewable energy pilot programs are providing opportunities for We Energies’ commercial and industrial customers to support renewable energy generation.
Participants in the Solar Now program receive monthly payments based on the capacity value of their hosted solar photovoltaic systems, while We Energies distributes the energy they produce throughout the system. In 2020, Solar Now systems: • Resulted in 4,959 metric tons of avoided carbon dioxide equivalents.
• Supported our green pricing programs, with 86% of Solar Now generation going to Energy for Tomorrow® customers.
Through the Dedicated Renewable Energy Resource program, We Energies partners with large commercial and industrial customers that have set ambitious renewable energy goals and builds specific renewable resources to serve their commitments.
As we implement and refine our plan to meet our GHG reduction goals, we are considering various opportunities to help reduce or mitigate GHG emissions, including local generation, sometimes referred to as distributed generation. Local generation is power production or energy storage technology dispersed throughout the power grid that provides electricity close to the point of use. We continue to evaluate the impact of local generation, including our Solar Now pilot program, across our electric service areas. Generating power at central station power plants, including at our utility-scale renewable energy facilities, helps us achieve economies of scale and produce continuous sources of power reliably, and at a competitive price.
Technology integration In addition to reducing GHG and other air emissions, research and experimentation with new technology benefits many areas of our business.
For example, our utilities are applying augmented reality hardware to improve safety, quality, timeliness and effectiveness of substation inspections with existing software tools. Another promising area of innovation is the deployment of drones (remotely piloted aircraft systems) to complete inspections, update aerial asset photos and make other observations in a more cost-effective manner than past methods. In addition, we have been experimenting with the growing field of data analytics, using machine learning and natural language processing to identify trends and take action to prevent failures on the distribution system.

The bedrock of the company, our employees strive to achieve optimal results with a customer focus to help us realize our full potential and business goals. We value their contributions and develop their talent in support of a strong, skilled workforce.
Diversity and inclusion. 
We are dedicated to ensuring a diverse workforce and inclusive workplace. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is more than following policies and procedures; it is a core strategic competency. We have a long history of valuing diversity as an integral part of our corporate culture that is recognized in our annual Top 10 goals. Making sure our workplace is inclusive and respectful means employees can bring their best and do their best. We value diversity and inclusion as an opportunity to strengthen our company’s success. We are committed to maximizing both individual contributions and organizational effectiveness through the diversity of our workforce.
This commitment reflects our strong determination to be a high-performance, pluralistic organization with a sustained competitive advantage in the global energy marketplace as we provide safe, reliable service and the best customer care.
We encourage diverse workforce development by fostering inclusion and equal opportunity. Diversity and inclusion are values and strengths that drive success and help us realize our full potential and business goals. A number of initiatives promote diverse workforce contributions, educate employees about diversity and inclusion and make our companies attractive employers for persons of diverse backgrounds. These include company support for a variety of development opportunities, such as programs for current leaders, an Emerging Leaders program that helps employees in nonsupervisory roles develop their leadership skills, and newly created webinars to educate employees and leaders regarding the company’s individual development plan process. We also support external programs such as Mount Mary University’s Women’s Leadership Institute, African American Leadership Program, McKinsey’s Black Academy, and Chicago United Corporate Inclusion Institute.
With a focus on inclusion, we promote business resource groups with executive sponsorship. The company has eight active and engaged groups: African American Business Resource Group, Asian Americans and Friends, Listo!+, Management Development Network, Military Service Members Association, Next Generation Network, WEC PROUD (LGBT+) and Women’s Development Network. These groups foster an atmosphere of inclusion and engage our employees in using their talents and interests to spark innovation and support our strategic goals. Each group helps strengthen alignment throughout our companies and our communities. They provide opportunities for networking, career and leadership development, and community engagement. Our business resource groups also serve as an avenue for feedback to the company on key opportunities and a means of providing diverse insights into promoting and further advancing the company’s business. For example, the business resource groups partnered with their executive sponsors and hosted a variety of virtual sessions throughout 2020, focusing on relevant topics such as partnering with. 
We commit to: • Supporting a highly qualified and diverse organization in all areas and at all levels.

Human rights. 
We support the principles of human rights as outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We are committed to maintaining a culture that supports human rights, and we demonstrate our commitment through various means, such as employee training and education. We educate all new employees on our Code of Business Conduct policies, which cover relevant aspects of human rights issues. All employees are trained on ethical standards, including anti-harassment and diversity appreciation.
Nondiscrimination We are committed to providing a work environment that respects the rights and dignity of each employee. Discrimination on the basis of race, gender, age, sexual orientation, country of origin, disability or other protected classes is not tolerated. Complaints are taken seriously and investigated thoroughly.
Federal and state laws We are subject to federal and state labor laws, which address: • Freedom of association and collective bargaining • Child labor • Forced and compulsory labor. 
Company operations do not interfere with employees’ freedom of association and collective bargaining, and we are committed to continued compliance with child labor laws, forced and compulsory labor laws, and the rights of indigenous people.
We support compliance with federal and state laws by continuous monitoring and auditing of our internal processes, such as hiring and promotion practices. Additionally, we actively encourage all employees to speak up if they believe our Code of Business Conduct or labor laws have been violated. All such reports are taken seriously and investigated. We expect the same standards from our suppliers and all other entities with which we conduct business.
Our board of directors has oversight responsibility for human rightsrelated policies, including the Code of Business Conduct, while our senior vice president — human resources and organizational effectiveness and other senior management are responsible for the development and implementation of these policies.

Additionally, we systematically analyze pay equity among employees, including a review of gender, race and ethnicity issues. Our compensation package offers a variety of benefits to both full- and part-time employees. Fulltime benefits include: • Medical insurance • Prescription drug coverage • Health savings accounts • Employee Assistance Program (including mental health counseling) • Dental insurance • Vision insurance • Employee retirement savings plan — 401(k) • Life insurance • Accidental death and dismemberment insurance • Business travel accident insurance • Flexible spending accounts • Long-term disability benefits • Vacation/paid time off days • Payable absence plan • Sick leave/short-term disability benefits • Pension plan • Tuition reimbursement • Commuter benefits • Wellness incentives • Service awards • Adoption assistance • Matching gifts program. 
External talent development. 
Strategic talent development is a business driver for our companies. We focus on growing a superior organization by attracting, selecting, onboarding, developing and retaining the right talent to meet business needs.
Our recruitment strategy is multifaceted. We use local, state, and national partners to share our job postings in an effort to ensure our opportunities are visible across a wide audience. Our companies use behavioral-based interviewing to identify top talent in a fair and unbiased manner. We have built relationships with agencies, high schools, colleges and universities in the areas our companies serve, and we invest in programs such as City Colleges of Chicago Gas Utility Workers Training Program, Urban Alliance and Cristo Rey Work Study Program. Each year, our companies employ students in internships and cooperative education programs.
Our companies have been recognized by local schools and universities for placing students in meaningful assignments leading to full-time jobs after graduation. We partner with military organizations and veterans groups to attract people with technical and leadership skills. Strong ties with community organizations and local government workforce development programs help us find diverse talent. For example, we post open positions with RecruitMilitary and a variety of community agencies, including the Hispanic Alliance for Career Enhancement, Urban League in Milwaukee and Chicago, Women in Trades and YWCA.
of open positions were filled through external recruiting ~50%
As a strategy for developing the external labor pool, our companies contribute to nonprofit organizations that support recruiting needs for a diverse, promotable workforce.

Employee development and engagement. 
Our leaders have the responsibility to continually develop the talent of their organizations through the broadening and deepening of business and leadership knowledge. Over the next five years, approximately 40% of the employees at WEC Energy Group companies will be eligible to retire. Succession planning and internal talent development are integral components of our workforce planning process.
As part of a proactive approach to ensure continuity of service delivery and the continuous development of our people, employees complete individual development plans on an annual basis to identify their short- and long-term career interests. Development is structured to meet the needs of the individual’s career interests and our companies’ business objectives.
Our board of directors reviews executive-level succession plans annually for leadership continuity. Senior management conducts an annual talent review to ensure talent is being identified and developed for future senior leadership roles. Development plans may include rotational assignments, project leadership, mentoring or other opportunities for enhancing their operational and leadership skills. Succession planning also is conducted annually in the business units to identify early career talent and assess future leadership potential. Talent pools are identified for critical operational and support roles along with plans to support their development.
To sustain a strong workforce, we have established efforts to foster employee well-being and achievement. We conducted a confidential employee engagement survey in 2018, gauging employees’ perceptions of their work, their leadership and the company as a whole. Our overall engagement index was on par with IBM’s database of best-in-class companies, with results above the IBM norm in employee commitment to the organization. We also found that an overwhelming majority of our employees embrace our safety culture and believe they have the resources to perform their jobs safely. Action plans have been created, and implementation is ongoing to continue to make improvements in identified areas. We plan to conduct another employee engagement survey in the second half of 2021.
Performance management. 
Employees are expected to hold each other accountable for demonstrating the top five competencies directly linked with business success: • Safety • Customer focus • Sense of urgency • Personal responsibility for results • Financial discipline. 
This clear expectation affects the entire performance management process. It requires a determined effort on the part of employees to apply the right energy and focus to achieve their objectives, and calls upon leaders to provide support and guidance aimed at encouraging the behaviors critical to company success.
Performance management is the process of aligning employee performance with the needs of the business. It includes goal setting, performance monitoring, measuring and appraising, and providing feedback and recognition. Leaders and employees have an ongoing feedback tool to ensure continuous conversations throughout the year. Every year, we publish our “Top 10” goals aligned with the core competencies to serve as an overarching guide for employees.
All management (nonrepresented) employees have a component of their pay affected by performance. This is accomplished through the annual incentive pay plan, which promotes the achievement of corporate goals while recognizing individual performance. Award funding for management employees is based on achievement of company performance related to targets for cost control, customer satisfaction, safety, and supplier and workforce diversity. Individual awards are based on individual performance toward objectives.


49 WEC ENERGY GROUP | 2020 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT. 
Training and education. 
Talent management is a primary focus for our companies, and employee training and development of both technical and leadership skills give us a sustainable competitive edge for the future. Training, mentoring and coaching are key elements in improving employee performance and, therefore, improving customer service, safety, corporate performance and system reliability.
In 2020, more than 204,000 classroom and e-learning training events took place throughout our companies. The vast majority of those learning events were delivered online, including annual ethics and compliance training, safety refreshers, operator qualification training and other job skill training. Leadership development also was augmented with online training. All employees had access to online training, ranging from learning software programs to business and leadership competencies, as well as access to portals that include topical references, job aids and simulations.
Assessment tools for individual contributors and leaders were used for a variety of development needs — in both program and individual consulting scenarios. In all instances, employees were provided expert guidance in using their assessment results and tying them to their individual development plans.
Meeting the needs of an evolving workforce: a case study. 
The natural gas distribution workforce in the U.S. is experiencing a large generational turnover. In recent years at our We Energies utility, we found historic developmental methods were focused mainly on job-specific qualifications, with limited opportunities for new employees to gain a wide range of education in the field.
In response, we embarked on a rebuild of our developmental path, and ultimately created a formal apprenticeship program. A committee was established to serve in an oversight and administration role for the program, with membership consisting of both management and union-represented field employees.
We concentrated on identifying activities and simulations to develop and verify skills within the formal training process. We also made an effort to ensure apprentices would receive exposure to several different operations and maintenance areas, and avoid being prematurely assigned to a specific function or area concentration.
New We Energies natural gas employees are now required to complete the apprenticeship program before receiving training in a more advanced tier of coursework. Apprentices can enter into the program at a progression step corresponding to their prior experience and understanding.
We hired our inaugural class of gas distribution apprentices in 2019, and the first apprentice from that class received their diploma in early 2021. The program has received positive feedback from apprentices, existing employees and leadership. We successfully registered the program with the State of Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development — Bureau of Apprenticeship Standards.


50 WEC ENERGY GROUP | 2020 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT. 
Leadership development Development of leadership skills remains a top priority. The corporate leadership development program begins with aspiring leaders. The Emerging Leaders program is a self-paced, online program consisting of seven required courses, supplemented with learning circle discussions and webinars.
The Foundations of Leadership program is for new supervisors. This curriculum includes training on leadership, employee engagement, talent management, diversity and inclusion, labor relations, crucial communication skills, and other important business and management skills for supervisors and leaders.
A new program, Foundations of Leadership II, was introduced in 2020. This program focuses on developing coaching and conflict management skills. It combines online courses with presentations by experienced leaders. A discussion board and learning circle conversations further enhance the learning experience.
Developing leaders at the manager level is accomplished in partnership with the Sheldon B. Lubar School of Business at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Leaders are offered an intensive curriculum with training on accountability, developing and implementing strategy, improving financial performance, team effectiveness, decision-making, negotiation, leading change and more. Participants begin and end this program with a focus on the feedback they have received from a 360-degree feedback survey.
In addition, leadership development is offered annually to director-level employees, also through the Lubar School of Business, consisting of executive education tailored to align with specific leadership competencies.
Supporting veterans in the workforce. 
In 2012, our Peoples Gas subsidiary partnered with the Gas Workers Local 18007 union, the Utility Workers Union of America’s Power for America Training Trust Fund, and City Colleges of Chicago to create the Utility Workers Military Assistance Program. The seven-month program prepares veterans for careers in the natural gas industry through both classroom instruction and in-field training. Graduates receive 52 college credits for an associate degree, as well as a Gas Utility Worker Advanced Certification at Dawson Technical Institute, a satellite site of Kennedy-King College. We now have trained more than 500 veterans through the program.

Safety and health. 
Our companies build and operate electric and natural gas distribution lines and facilities with the safety of our employees and the public as our top priority.
Internal safety. 
Our safety strategy includes use of integrated scorecards, quality control principles, employee engagement techniques and best practice programs. All employees are expected to work safely and foster a safe workplace.
Safety commitment. 
We are committed to keeping our employees and the public safe. Over the past decade, our companies have improved their safety records by implementing and improving key programs. These efforts have helped reduce the total numbers of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)-recordable incidents and lost-time incidents by 48% and 33%, respectively, since 2010. Because we understand the negative effects that injuries have on employees, their families and friends, and their co-workers, our goal is to have one of the best safety records in the nation.
We are working continuously to promote additional improvement across all companies in 2021 and beyond, and to ensure that our safety efforts are sustainable. Our unwillingness to view injuries as inevitable is an important part of our cultural platform, an ongoing safety commitment that we refer to as “Target Zero.”
Management and union leadership work together to reinforce the Target Zero culture and provide a safe work environment. We urge each employee to make a personal safety commitment and to talk with co-workers about safety on a regular basis. Supervisors and managers are responsible for hearing employee concerns, training to current standards and recognizing those who demonstrate concern for safety. We further encourage all of our employees to bring that personal commitment home to their families, friends and communities.
OSHArecordables down 48% since 2010. 
Lost-time incidents down 33% since 2010 


52 WEC ENERGY GROUP | 2020 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT. 
Targeting top-quartile safety performance. 
Across the organization, we are focused on reinforcing the understanding that a strong safety culture is built on a culture of caring. A broad-based team has been assembled with the goal of improving engagement, reducing risks and injuries, and being on a clear path to top-quartile safety performance by the end of 2021. The team includes representation from senior leadership, as well as experienced field professionals from across WEC Energy Group. The team is advised by union leaders and receives input from business unit safety steering committees, management and represented safety committees, and other safety teams.
As its first order of business, the team charged frontline leaders with creating shared safety plans with their work groups, in support of broader business unit safety plans and initiatives. Leaders also provide quarterly updates to their respective executives and chain of command.
The team identifies locations with strong performance, as well as those with opportunities to improve, and shares lessons learned from those cases to promote best practices. Employees are encouraged to work together to discuss how a task will be done safely or to express concern when they see something that may lead to a potential injury. Leadership recognizes a job well done and celebrates them across the organization so everyone can learn from them.
In addition, executive leadership takes an active role in personally reaching out to injured employees, to make sure they are doing well and to learn what we can do to eliminate future injuries throughout the company. There also is a regular call that includes senior executives and department leadership to review any OSHA-recordable and lost-time incidents and take the appropriate actions to mitigate a recurrence.
Ultimately, the top-quartile team aims to establish a more sustainable approach and platform for safety, while reinforcing a culture of caring.


53 WEC ENERGY GROUP | 2020 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT. 
Company safety structure. 
Employee safety success is supported by increasing employee engagement and accountability at all levels. Through Safety Action teams and Regional Safety teams, every employee has a voice. More employees are becoming actively engaged in safety, leading to new ideas and improvements in system designs, programs, tools and procedures.
Our Executive Safety Committee directs our safety and health strategy and works to ensure consistency across work groups. The committee provides a forum to review and discuss accidents and injuries, implement injury-prevention activities, develop new programs, and enhance ongoing safety and health initiatives. Management uses weekly safety conference calls to focus on safety for occupations that are exposed to a large number of hazards. During calls, management discusses injuries, accidents and significant events that have taken place and ways to prevent recurrences. We are increasingly focused on incident potential.
Management and represented employees work together to identify risks and prevent injuries. To maintain a positive safety culture, management employees are expected to provide daily information and communication about safety topics. In addition, they are responsible for implementing and evaluating safety programs and outcomes. Employees who work in the field and at power plants use a variety of tools to identify and manage risks on the jobsite, follow rules and procedures, and speak up about safety issues.
Work group-specific safety events are held throughout our companies. For example, many employees in highly hazardous occupations participate in safety conferences or periodic meetings with management to discuss safety goals, techniques, tools and equipment.
Safety goals In addition to measuring OSHA-recordable and lost-time incidents, we set goals around measurable leading indicators, which raise awareness about employee safety and guide injury-prevention activities.
Each department monitors shared leading-indicator goals. Some work groups track additional leading indicators, such as proactive audits, drills and inspections, to address specific concerns and areas of opportunity. A safety performance scorecard allows employees to monitor progress toward safety goals.
We are working with industry allies to identify and use standardized classifications to help manage risk and share findings within our industry network as leading indicators. Those incidents that have potential for or result in an actual significant injury or fatality (SIF) are acted upon for investigations using a safety classification and learning model.
Additional leading indicators that relate to managing risk exposures are being implemented. Key control measures for hazard recognition and control are part of that scope, such as validation of the quality of daily pre-job briefings and discussions.
Tasks with high levels of risk have been and continue to be proactively assessed for consistent work practices across various segments within our footprint. Doing so helps ensure compliance with procedures and engage workers in improvement opportunities, in particular those with high SIF potential.
We evaluate all incident types (injuries, property damage, fleet asset damage, and near misses and unsafe conditions) for their potential for injury severity, in addition to the actual consequences. This risk evaluation allows us to assign more resources to those incidents that offer high-value opportunities for risk reduction and improvement.
Our companies have monitored OSHA-recordable and lost-time incidents for decades and began monitoring safety leading indicators in 2009. Our safety record indicates employee commitment to working safely, and we continue to work to do even better.
Safety leading-indicator goals include:
Near miss / unsafe condition (NMUC) program metrics — Our companies are focused on increased reporting of near-miss events and unsafe conditions. We respond to action items and communicate results to employees.
Observation programs — Our companies incorporate observation programs to identify and address at-risk behaviors, while also reinforcing positive behaviors. Most of our utilities have some form of peer-to-peer observation program, enhancing our safety culture.
Employee health — Since health impacts safety, we encourage employees to complete a biometric health screening and to increase physical activity, as appropriate. We also have increased our communications to employees and their families about the mental health benefits available to them.

Near miss / unsafe condition reporting Identifying near-miss events and unsafe conditions can help reduce risk and prevent injury. Reporting these incidents is an essential first step. The NMUC reporting program used throughout WEC Energy Group encourages all employees to own accident prevention and allows situations to be publicized to a wide audience, providing an educational benefit to all. All employees are encouraged to report unsafe conditions or incidents that could have led to injury, including NMUCs that have occurred at home or in their communities.
For work-related incidents, a variety of stakeholders may analyze the reports and assign and/or escalate issues for resolution.
Our employees have improved reporting of NMUCs over the past three years. Only a small fraction (less than 0.1%) of the total reports in 2020 were work-related NMUCs of a higher risk potential. We will continue to foster a strong reporting and action-oriented culture in the workplace.
Contractor safety expectations WEC Energy Group companies provide contractors with safety program expectations to help ensure that all work performed on company property and at company facilities is completed safely and without unnecessary risks and hazards. Contractors are selected, in part, by their OSHA-recordable incident rates and experience modification rates. Prospective contractors may be required to provide a detailed explanation of their employee health and safety obligations, programs and safety record. In many instances, each prospective contractor’s safety performance is reviewed prior to awarding contracts.
Ergonomic enhancements The most common injuries across the company continue to be strains and sprains. Companywide, safety teams analyze tools, equipment and job techniques based on ergonomics to prevent such injuries. Results include the creation of handbooks and videos to demonstrate proper tool use. Stretching and strengthening programs also are available to employees.
The company has an advocacy program in which medical nurses work with the injured to get the best quality medical care possible. The nurses will continually assist these employees until they return to their normal job functions or until they have reached maximum medical improvement.


55 WEC ENERGY GROUP | 2020 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT. 
Employee health and wellness We provide various benefits and resources designed to promote healthy living, both at work and at home. The companies offer competitive benefit plans designed to help employees actively manage their health.
We encourage employees to receive preventive examinations and proactively care for their health. Condition-management support and health coaching for lifestyle issues are available to employees who participate in the medical plan. Free health screenings (provided onsite in many instances) and other incentives encourage all employees to know which healthy targets — related to cholesterol, weight, blood glucose and blood pressure — they have under control and which may need more attention. Employees also are encouraged to complete a health risk assessment and work with their medical providers to further understand their health status.
Our companies also work to provide employees a safe, drug-free environment. All employees are part of a drug and alcohol testing program to maintain that environment. Those who have an addiction are offered the opportunity to self-identify, and we will work with them to seek assistance. For substance use and mental health support, we encourage use of the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), a free benefit for all employees and their families, administered by an external counseling agency. EAP is a confidential way to get professional assessments, referrals, short-term counseling and treatment monitoring related to behavioral health concerns.
Our companies also offer wellness programs for employees and their families. By engaging employees in health education activities and promoting healthy lifestyle habits at work and home, the wellness programs promote a proactive approach to health care decisions. The wellness programs facilitate health screenings, host health challenges for individuals and teams, and provide other resources to encourage employees to take care of their health and manage stress.
Safety Charity Challenge. 
To further foster a positive safety culture, WEC Energy Group holds the Safety Charity Challenge, a quarterly incentive in which employees whose companies meet their safety improvement goals may vote to direct donations to local nonprofits. The purpose of the program is to rally employees around workplace safety and create a positive impact in the communities in which they live and work.
In 2020, WEC Energy Group charitable giving programs and foundations contributed a total of $50,000 to local charities through the Safety Charity Challenge.


56 WEC ENERGY GROUP | 2020 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT. 
Public safety. 
We have developed and implemented an integrity management program for natural gas transmission mains in accordance with local, state and federal regulations. We complete risk analyses annually and identify high-consequence areas. We perform physical assessments of transmission mains and remediate as necessary.
Likewise, we monitor the integrity of electric distribution lines through routine patrols, and a dedicated tree-trimming plan focuses on maintaining adequate clearance around electric distribution wires and poles. Electric distribution infrastructure upgrades replace aging equipment according to a plan that supports system safety and reliability.
Across the organization, we conduct comprehensive incident response planning to uphold public and employee safety. Our plans address immediate emergency response at each of our sites, as well as business continuity for each critical business process and communication protocols for notifying external stakeholders — including customers, local media, government and regulatory agencies. We test or drill every plan and have established critical leadership teams for crisis management. In addition, we have participated in national drills with our peers in the energy industry. These methods help us prepare for and, if need be, respond to a range of potential threats, including natural disasters, loss of critical IT or telecommunications systems, loss of gas and electric operations, and damage to facilities.
Education and outreach Our companies proactively share safety information with a variety of audiences, including students, teachers, families, contractors and first responders.
Students Education programs for schoolchildren include classroom materials such as brochures, posters and other teacher workshop materials provided free to educators upon request. Wisconsin Public Service (WPS) offers the award-winning Path-to-Ground Electric Safety and Natural Gas Safety modules for middle school students. WPS also collaborates regularly with the Einstein Project in Green Bay, Wisconsin, to promote electric and natural gas safety and efficiency education.
Contractors Construction contractors are a key audience. Annually, our companies reach out to this audience to provide needed instruction on working safely around energy facilities.
By state law, customers and contractors must use a one-call system to have underground facilities marked before they dig. We communicate the importance of safe digging through a variety of channels, including social media campaigns, customer newsletters, and presentations to contractors and first responders.
When we hire construction contractors to work on major company projects, we hold pre-construction meetings that focus on safety practices.
First responders We also work closely with first responders: public safety agencies, police and fire departments, rescue services, emergency government representatives, and public officials. They need to know how to reach our companies and work safely with us during emergencies.
For example, Michigan Gas Utilities partners with other Michigan pipeline operators to review and train firefighters, police, emergency medical personnel and contractors on proper procedures for identifying and working near natural gas lines.
Agriculture services and safety We Energies and WPS have well-established agriculture services programs. Employees work closely with farm customers on issues of wiring safety, efficiency and reliability. Livestock confinement facilities often receive additional attention because of the possibility of stray voltage from farm and/or company sources.
Stray voltage is a term used to describe low-level voltages found on metal surfaces with which livestock may come into contact. Trained technicians perform cost-free stray voltage investigations and have helped hundreds of agricultural customers identify farm wiring deficiencies and reduce stray voltage sources.
We Energies and WPS representatives participate on the Midwest Rural Energy Council and the University of Wisconsin Stray Voltage Investigator Training Series. Additionally, representatives participate on many committees and boards within the agriculture industry.


Community engagement. 
Our companies provide financial support for nonprofit, tax-exempt organizations in our communities. In support of our priority sustainability issues, focus areas include education, community and neighborhood development, arts and culture, health and human services, and the environment.
Our employees take an active role in their communities, serving on nonprofit boards and volunteering their time. Our companies and associated business resource groups promote a range of volunteer opportunities for current and retired employees. Workplace giving campaigns in our subsidiary companies also support the arts and numerous United Way organizations in the areas we serve.
2020 giving to nonprofits. 
Funding through foundations, operations. 
We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service (WPS) each operate foundations. The We Energies Foundation supports organizations within the We Energies and Upper Michigan Energy Resources service areas. The WPS Foundation operates within the WPS, Minnesota Energy Resources, Michigan Gas Utilities and Upper Michigan Energy Resources service areas. Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas have a corporate contributions program that supports nonprofits in the same manner.
We review grant proposals from local nonprofit organizations and direct donations based on a variety of factors, including community needs, the requesting organization’s strategy and the proposal’s projected impact. In addition, we operate matching gifts programs for each of our utilities that double eligible donations made to nonprofits by active and retired employees.
We strive to develop ongoing relationships with these nonprofit organizations. Many have received multiyear or renewed grants from our foundations and giving programs, and we continue dialogue with them to understand the impacts of our contributions. We evaluate progress on initiatives along with the success of programming. In 2020, company and foundation leaders engaged with nonprofit representatives through approximately 200 virtual or in-person visits with our community partners.
Charitable outreach goals: • Pursue a sustained, consistent approach to funding within the focus areas, better enabling the organizations to achieve lasting results.
• Foster mutually beneficial relationships between our subsidiaries and community organizations.

North Shore Gas has provided funding for curriculum development and a commercial composting initiative in participating schools. Through recycling, composting and food recovery, the schools divert roughly 85% of their waste from landfills.
Creating educational opportunities. 
Believing every child deserves equal access to education and opportunity, our foundations and operating companies partnered with local schools and organizations to support remote learning.
During the pandemic, our North Shore Gas utility provided Comp-U-Dopt funding to help support distribution of over 5,000 computers to underserved youth in Chicago and Northern Illinois. The We Energies Foundation provided more than $40,000 for technology and computers to better support Milwaukee Public Schools and other Milwaukee students remote learning.
Supplying much-needed resources. 
United Way of Metro Chicago is committed to fighting for the health, education, financial stability and safety of every person in every neighborhood across the Chicago region.

Energy reliability. 
Reliable service remains a top priority across our companies. In 2020, we continued strengthening and modernizing our generating assets, as well as our electric and natural gas distribution networks, to support reliability, safety and customer satisfaction.
Electric reliability. 
Our employees are there, no matter the weather conditions, to provide customers with the energy they need. Providing customers with useful information during electric power outages also is important to customer satisfaction.
That’s why, when bad weather threatens, our electric energy companies mobilize to provide customers with proactive, accurate and consistent information about the potential impact to their electric service. We want customers to know we are monitoring forecasts, assessing employee and contractor availability, and checking inventories for poles, wires and other equipment that may be needed.
When outages occur, we provide customers with regular updates on both their specific outage and the overall damage to our system. We also keep them up to date on our progress in restoring service. We share messages with customers through online outage maps, automated call-handling equipment, care center agents, account managers, and public and social media. Outbound calls also let customers know the reason for and status of their outage, and confirm that their service has been restored.
Natural gas reliability. 
We deliver reliable natural gas service to residential and business customers through a network of underground pipes. Our natural gas distribution companies regularly monitor our pipes to ensure their integrity and follow a plan to upgrade aging equipment to maintain reliable service.
To ensure reliable service and less volatile prices throughout the year, our companies buy natural gas when prices are lower — usually in summer — and place it in storage. This stored natural gas is then blended with natural gas that is price-locked through contracts and with natural gas that is purchased on the spot market. This strategy reduces the impact of natural gas price spikes on our customers.
For the 10th consecutive year, We Energies earned PA Consulting’s ReliabilityOne award for outstanding electric reliability performance in the Midwest.

Post-interaction surveys Many customers have the option of completing a survey immediately after they interact with customer care centers. Approximately 82,300 customers took advantage of this opportunity in 2020. We review survey results daily and follow up promptly when an issue or concern is identified.
Digital engagement Many of our companies use social media to communicate with customers and enhance their customer experience. Social media channels are monitored, and customers receive personal responses to specific questions and concerns. Our companies continue to expand their social media platforms.
During storms and other events, our companies use traditional channels, online outage maps and social media to warn customers about the dangers associated with downed wires and damaged natural gas mains. Customized alerts provide some customers with proactive, real-time communication about electric outages.
Over 4,500 residential customers have joined MyEnergyPanel, our online feedback group. They share their opinions with us through monthly surveys and discussions. MyEnergyPanel is dedicated to improving the overall customer experience, focusing on experiences with customer service, energy reliability, bill paying and other topics.
'We Care' calls. 
We want every customer interaction to be a positive experience. In many cases, employees follow up with a phone call to confirm that customers who recently had service calls were completely satisfied with the service they received. In 2020, we contacted 306,427 residential and business customers with personal or automated We Care calls. Customers who express concerns receive additional followup to ensure that their concerns are addressed.

Energy affordability. 
We enable customers to take an active part in managing their energy use and expenses, and our energy companies provide them with tools and programs to achieve those goals.
Offering options. 
Customers have different needs and preferences, and having choices is important to them. Billing options, which vary by energy company, include online billing, seasonal billing, renewable energy pricing, and budget billing to spread energy charges more evenly over 12 months.
Payment arrangements. Difficult circumstances can arise that may prevent customers from paying their bills in full. We encourage customers having problems paying their bills to work with our companies to keep their service connected. We offer flexible payment arrangements based upon each customer’s individual situation. Flexibility may be reflected in timelines, required down payment amounts and payment plan time frames.
Options for low-income customers. Our companies work collaboratively with government agencies and community-based organizations throughout their service areas to address the needs of our low-income customers. We inform customers about home energy assistance through federal and state funding. We also offer weatherization services for some customers on our low-income pay plans and partner with the Wisconsin State Weatherization program.
Our companies make regular contributions to nonprofit organizations to help provide financial assistance and case management services. Through phone consultations, our company websites and other communications, we provide our customers with efficiency tips to help save money on their energy bills.
Our companies contributed approximately $3.2 million to low-income customer programs in 2020.

Providing personalized assistance and savings. 
Our energy efficiency programs support customers across our service areas. Headwaters Science Center, an educational organization in northern Minnesota, converted a nearly 100-year-old building into a hands-on learning space for visitors to explore science and technology through interactive exhibits and programs. It became apparent over time that costly heating and cooling extremes would need to be addressed. The center was too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter, and the poor circulation of fresh air was not optimal for a building with more than 20,000 visitors a year and hundreds of animals in residence.
By partnering with our Minnesota Energy Resources subsidiary, Headwaters Science Center participated in an energy-saving audit to identify ways to save energy and reduce operating costs. The audit indicated that an HVAC system renovation would improve efficiency and comfort. The center received more than $2,000 in natural gas rebates from Minnesota Energy Resources for high-efficiency furnaces and Wi-Fi enabled thermostats. After the improvements, the center’s HVAC costs decreased by one-third, and it could afford to operate the new system year-round, improving indoor temperatures and air quality.
Efficiency programs made an impact in our communities in 2020.

While specific programs and services vary across our companies, we are committed to offering options that support sustainable economic development in our region.
Our largest customers are supported by a companywide team led by account managers who work proactively to help manage their energy needs. Annually, account managers and key customers develop joint plans outlining energy-related goals, expectations and initiatives. In addition, account managers look for opportunities to introduce emerging technologies, reduce energy waste, identify power quality enhancement opportunities and assist with business expansions.
Other business customers can access targeted services and receive recommendations on energy efficiency measures through our customer care centers.
Public-private partnerships. 
Company leaders, account managers and other company representatives serve as liaisons with state, regional and local economic development agencies, providing financial and/or in-kind support, such as: • Board and committee involvement • Site selection support • Project analysis related to energy infrastructure and rates • Project oversight and monitoring. 
Dedicated leaders forge relationships with these agencies to equip existing and prospective customers with the tools they need to grow sustainably.
Market-based rates. 
Qualifying We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service commercial and industrial electric customers may purchase a portion of their load at market prices. Customers on these rates can manage their energy usage in a market environment of risks and rewards. Using day-ahead prices, customers can strategically plan operations while maximizing the benefit of a market rate.
Online tools. 
Where available, online tools make it possible for business customers to analyze and manage their energy use. Customers can receive monthly alerts of energy usage changes, identify usage trends and patterns, forecast forward-looking energy budgets, and access an online library of energy efficiency information.
WEC Energy Group partners with local economic development organizations to attract and retain new businesses and talent.

74 WEC ENERGY GROUP | 2020 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT. 
Strategic governance. 
We believe that effective and transparent corporate governance is an essential driver of stockholder value and the foundation for long-lasting sustainability.
Governance structure and practices. 
Our governance structure is aimed at transparent accountability to key stakeholders. Strong business processes, coupled with diverse leadership perspectives, are at the heart of our operations, and provide the enterprise with effective guidance to anticipate, plan and manage corporate initiatives and risk, while remaining focused on ethical stewardship. More on the board’s oversight structure is detailed on the next page.
In 1996, WEC Energy Group became one of the earliest adopters of a formal set of corporate governance guidelines, a framework through which our board of directors conducts its business. As part of its normal cadence, the Corporate Governance Committee annually reviews the board’s structure and governance practices, taking into consideration input derived from industry surveys, benchmarking studies, sustainability ratings providers and disclosure frameworks, stakeholder engagement sessions, and proxy voting guidelines issued by institutional investors and proxy advisors. To ensure the board maintains governance best practices, the Corporate Governance Committee recommends to the board revisions to the guidelines as often as needed.
Robust disclosure on the board’s governance structure and practices is readily available on the governance section of the company’s website, as well as in publications devoted to those topics, including the annual proxy statement.
Risk management. 
Our board of directors is responsible for providing oversight with respect to our major strategic initiatives, which requires ongoing dialogue with our senior management team about opportunities and risks, and the processes through which senior management maintains focus on the organization’s key financial and business objectives, corporate policies, and overall economic, environmental and social performance. Senior management, in turn, is responsible for effectively planning and executing daily operations within a strong risk framework.
Internal reviews and audits Management’s enterprisewide approach to managing risk and compliance is facilitated through our Enterprise Risk Steering Committee (ERSC), which is chaired by our chief operating officer (COO) and consists of the CEO and other senior-level management employees. ERSC members regularly review the company’s key risk areas and provide input into the development and implementation of effective compliance and risk management practices.
As a standing corporate practice, each year, the company’s risk areas are systemically evaluated. The Audit Services department conducts an annual enterprise risk assessment, whereby business leaders identify existing, new or emerging issues or changes within their business areas that could have enterprisewide implications. Risk areas are then mapped to create a cumulative assessment of their significance, likelihood and velocity of risk impact, taking into consideration industry benchmarking information, as appropriate. The mapping also identifies lines of responsibility for managing the risks to ensure accountability and focus.
On a bimonthly basis, the ERSC discusses findings of the Audit Services annual enterprise risk assessment, holds in-depth discussions with members of management on identified subjects, and tracks progress and status of mitigation efforts. Updates from these meetings are shared with the board as directed by the CEO. The CEO provides reports to the board at each board meeting and routinely calls upon members of his staff, including the COO, CFO and executive vice president of external affairs, to provide detailed updates to the board in their respective areas of responsibility, including matters of enterprise risk.


75 WEC ENERGY GROUP | 2020 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT. 
Board oversight To carry out its oversight function, the board and its committees meet regularly throughout the year. Board members receive briefings prepared by management and outside advisers on specific areas of current and emerging risks to the enterprise as captured through the company’s enterprise risk management framework. The committees routinely report to the full board on matters that fall within designated areas of responsibility. Examples of risk oversight responsibilities assigned to each committee include:
Audit and Oversight Committee: Financial reporting; outside auditor independence; and legal and regulatory compliance matters including environmental, data privacy and security (including cyber, physical and operating technology), litigation, ethics and compliance, and electric reliability standards compliance.
Compensation Committee: Compensation practices and programs, executive succession planning, human capital management and development, and CEO performance.
Corporate Governance Committee: Governance structure and practices, director independence, board performance and board succession planning.
Finance Committee: Capital allocation, capital structure and financings, employee retirement and benefit plan assets, and insurance management.
With the exception of the Executive Committee, the members who serve on the board’s committees are independent.
While the board delegates specified duties to its committees, it retains collective responsibility for comprehensive risk oversight, including short- and long-term critical risks that could significantly impact the company. The board believes that certain matters should be contemplated by the diverse perspective of its full membership. This includes oversight of risks that have the potential to result in significant financial or reputational consequences that could impact the company’s brand and jeopardize its value to stockholders.

76 WEC ENERGY GROUP | 2020 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT. 
Policies and procedures. 
We have policies in place, such as the Code of Business Conduct, that address situations that could lead to improper or illegal behavior on the part of employees. All employees and members of the company’s board of directors are expected to comply with our Code of Business Conduct, in addition to laws and regulations. The code addresses key aspects of our ethical culture and work environment, including: • Focus on safety • Anti-harassment and nondiscrimination • Anti-bribery and corruption • Diversity and inclusion • Accountability for conflicts of interest, confidentiality and fair dealing • Proper use of company assets • Protection of information. 
Ethics and compliance. 
Employees have a responsibility to preserve the ethical standards of our company as it conducts business affairs. The purpose of the ethics and compliance program is to promote an organizational culture that encourages ethical conduct and a commitment to compliance with the law, and to inspire high standards of professionalism and integrity.
Program elements The ethics and compliance program is designed to help our employees sustain an ethical workplace and help the company comply with applicable legal requirements and good corporate governance standards. Key responsibilities of the Ethics and Compliance office include: • Administer the Code of Business Conduct and related policies and procedures.
• Manage a confidential reporting system, in which reporters may choose to remain anonymous, to receive and respond to allegations of violations of the Code of Business Conduct • Provide guidance and advice to employees on policy questions and ethics and compliance matters.
• Protect employees who make good-faith allegations of misconduct with strong nonretaliation provisions.
• Provide regular education on ethics and business conduct standards.
• Provide regular reports to the Audit and Oversight Committee of the board of directors.
• Conduct periodic assessments of the effectiveness of the ethics and compliance program.
Elements of the ethics and compliance program are aligned with the criteria articulated in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines to demonstrate an effective program. Annual review of program effectiveness is reported to the Audit and Oversight Committee of the board of directors.
Reporting and investigating We encourage employees to seek advice in doubtful situations, express concerns or report suspected violations through any established channels without fear of retaliation. The established channels include: supervisors, confidential EthicsLine (phone and web portal), compliance officer and Corporate Security. It is the responsibility of the Ethics and Compliance office to maintain the integrity of the reporting channels and to address any potential for retaliation, in accordance with our Non-Retaliation Policy.
The Ethics and Compliance office oversees investigations, tracks progress, and ensures that a proper record of the investigation and resolution is made. After the investigation is completed, reasonable steps are taken to prevent further instances. This may include, among other things, examining the designs of the internal controls in place to prevent or detect the instance, revising policies and/or procedures, communicating policies to employees, and developing and requiring employees to take additional training.


77 WEC ENERGY GROUP | 2020 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT. 
Communication and training Continual employee development and awareness of potential ethical dilemmas remain priorities. All new employees receive Code of Business Conduct and other core compliance training to be completed within 30 days of hire. To maintain a high level of awareness, all employees are required annually to confirm their personal commitment to compliance. We strive for a 100% completion rate for compliance training and affirmation.
Materials are available on the company intranet to help leaders guide discussions with their staff about ethics and compliance matters. In addition, leaders receive materials on specific topics, such as identifying, disclosing and addressing conflicts of interest through various channels.
Monitoring and auditing Periodically, employees are invited to participate in a workplace ethics survey gauging their perceptions of the company’s actions, processes and operating style. The results provide management with the ability to assess our ethical climate.
Enforcement and discipline Enforcing standards underscores our commitment to compliance.
Corporate policies include consequences for noncompliance. Failure to comply with corporate policies shall result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. We track reported violations of corporate policies, along with the actions taken to ensure consistent and appropriate disciplinary measures. Violations of corporate policies that lead to discipline are reported to the Audit and Oversight Committee of the board of directors.
Response and prevention We provide a structural foundation to promote a culture of prevention, detection and resolution of instances of unethical and unlawful business conduct. We collaborate with appropriate personnel to ensure that consistent corrective action is taken in response to substantiated ethical misconduct. We monitor that actions taken by case investigators are objective and that proper controls are put in place to prevent future occurrence.
We encourage employees to seek advice in doubtful situations, express concerns and report suspected violations through any established channels without fear of retaliation.


78 WEC ENERGY GROUP | 2020 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT. 
Cybersecurity is the responsibility of all employees and contractors. As such, all employees and contractors are required to complete training annually regarding information security and acceptable use of corporate electronic resources. Rolebased cybersecurity training also is required annually. Our cybersecurity awareness program delivers key and topical cybersecurity messages throughout the year via posters, flyers and intranet announcements.
Cybersecurity. 
The energy industry requires the use of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, and we understand the importance of securing these systems against intrusion and attack.
The cyberthreat landscape is constantly evolving, and we manage related risks through cybersecurity monitoring, defense and response tools, effectiveness assessment, governance, collaboration throughout the industry, and employee training and awareness.
Our cybersecurity governance model includes oversight by senior management from our Enterprise Risk Steering Committee, along with steering committees for information security, operational technology security, third-party vendor security controls, Sarbanes-Oxley security controls, and North American Electric Reliability Corporation Critical Infrastructure Protection (NERC CIP) compliance. The chief operating officer and chief information officer report regularly to the board and its Audit and Oversight committee about the company’s enterprise risks, which include cybersecurity matters.
Using recognized cybersecurity framework and maturity models from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Department of Energy, we continuously assess the maturity of our cybersecurity program and incorporate improvements as needed.
We strive to follow industry best practices for computer network protection and provide effective physical security for our critical cyber assets. Following a 2019 audit of our compliance with NERC CIP standards, the external auditors positively noted our demonstrated “culture of compliance,” with only minor findings.
We participate in cyberattack response exercises, including GridEx events, the Grid Security Exercise sponsored by NERC, as well as information sharing, vulnerability analysis and emergency response with federal, state and industry organizations. To better comprehend the scope and magnitude of any active threats to our industry and nation, we communicate with other energy companies and other sectors of the economy concerning cyber incidents.


79 WEC ENERGY GROUP | 2020 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT. 
Stakeholder transparency. 
We seek to build strong, collaborative relationships with our stakeholders, including customers, communities, investors and employees.
Communication on projects. 
As our companies make progress on our capital projects, our External Affairs and Corporate Communications teams keep our customers and communities informed about the work we are doing and the investments we have planned. Our executive vice president — external affairs is responsible for outreach to local government and regulatory officials, and our senior vice president — corporate communications and investor relations is responsible for our customer communications.
We notify customers in writing if they may be adjacent to or impacted by our projects. In the early stages of our major projects, we also typically contact affected individuals, businesses and local officials through face-to-face visits and phone calls, welcoming questions and feedback. This dialogue informs our subsequent communications and project strategies. Depending on the size and scope of a project, we may host informational meetings.
Stockholder engagement. 
We have a comprehensive outreach and engagement program in place to ensure management and the board hear, understand and consider issues that matter most to our stockholders. This ongoing engagement provides valuable insight into how our stockholders view the company’s practices and policies, shapes the processes used to evaluate goals and expectations, and identifies emerging issues that may affect our corporate governance practices and compensation.
During 2020, we proactively communicated with stockholders, representing more than 37% of the company’s outstanding common stock, about our environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. We also engaged with key constituents across the broader ESG community , including Climate Action 100+, a global investor-led initiative focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Specific topics of engagement included corporate strategy, climate change and decarbonization, diversity and inclusion, COVID-19 response, and our newly assessed priority sustainability issues.
Employee involvement. 
Many internal communications are designed to inform and support our employees as they contribute to sustainabilityrelated projects. Our environmental, social and governance plans and targets have been highlighted across subsidiaries through our ‘Top 10’ goals, regular corporate news and quarterly leader communications on our progress.
To encourage feedback and ideas for potential improvements, a number of location- and departmentspecific channels are open to employees. These include the companywide near miss and unsafe condition reporting program and a Power Generation effort publishing answers from leaders to questions submitted anonymously.
Environmental, social and governance reporting. 
In addition to engaging directly with our stakeholders, we report on sustainability-related topics in a number of ways. We have published this annual corporate responsibility report for the past two decades, and our climate report, updated this year, presents our climate-related governance and strategy in more detail.
We routinely respond to data verification and survey requests from third-party organizations, and we have disclosed information on our operations and climate-related risks and opportunities to CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) for over a decade. We also are participating in initiatives led by Edison Electric Institute and American Gas Association to promote consistency and transparency in sustainability reporting across the energy utility sector.
Reports can be found on the Corporate Responsibility page of our website: www.wecenergygroup.com/csr/
Many areas of the company work together to ensure stakeholders get key information on our services and activities, as well as opportunities for dialogue with us.


80 WEC ENERGY GROUP | 2020 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT. 
Government relations. 
We advocate on behalf of our customers, stockholders and employees for safe, reliable and affordable energy before local, state and federal elected officials and government agencies.
We maintain governmental and regulatory relations offices in Chicago, Illinois; Rosemount, Minnesota; Madison, Green Bay and Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Washington, D.C. We also hire contract lobbyists and work with trade organizations to assist in advocacy activities. Our lobbyists are lawfully registered in each jurisdiction where they perform services for us.
Political action disbursements. 
Contribution amounts are limited by law, and we adhere to all applicable federal and state laws where we do business. As part of its oversight function, the board’s Audit and Oversight Committee, which consists solely of independent directors, conducts an annual review of the company’s Political Contributions Policy. This policy governs contributions to organizations operating under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code and organizations that qualify as national political committees. In 2020, we made no contributions of this nature, nor did we contribute to 501(c)(4) organizations or make any independent political expenditures in direct support of or opposition to a campaign or ballot measure.
The company has five political action committees (PACs) across its geographical footprint, which are authorized by elections laws to collect voluntary contributions from employees who choose to participate. The PACs support causes and candidates for federal, state and local offices to benefit energy safety, reliability and affordability, without regard for executives’ personal political preferences. In Illinois, Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas are allowed to make corporate political contributions to candidates for election to state and local offices, subject to statutory limits. In Wisconsin, WEC Energy Group may make corporate contributions of up to $12,000 per calendar year to a segregated fund account of a political party committee or a legislative campaign committee. All other political contributions in Wisconsin and our other state jurisdictions can only be made by individuals or through PACs.
All of our PACs are administered by oversight committees that include appointed and elected members. Oversight committees make decisions on how and where dollars are spent. The committees also review a summary of political activities and associated reporting excerpted from the Corporate Responsibility Report in advance of its publication each year.
