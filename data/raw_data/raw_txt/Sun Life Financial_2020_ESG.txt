Global Context and Megatrends. 
A look at global events and trends during the past year that influence the context in which we operate and informed our sustainability actions.
Global pandemic. 
Climate crisis. 
Racial injustice. 
Data security. 
Demand for sustainability disclosures. 
Mental health crisis 1 World Health Organization. “COVID-19 disrupting mental health services in most countries, WHO survey”. Oct 2020.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a global pandemic. It has resulted in the loss of lives, impacts on disability, pressure on health-care systems, supply chain disruptions, financial stress and more.
The pandemic affected our stakeholders and all areas of our business. We adjusted our operations as government restrictions and measures evolved around the globe. And we acted quickly to provide extra support for our Clients, employees and communities. Learn more about our response throughout this report.
Over the course of 2020, the world continued to witness the intensifying impacts and risks associated with climate change. At the same time, we saw more people and organizations responding to the crisis with various actions. Sun Life’s current focus is to mobilize investments in businesses and assets that support the transition to a low-carbon economy, reduce our operational impacts, and integrate climate resiliency factors into our buildings and continuity planning. To learn more, refer to pages 28-30 and 41-46.
2020 provided a wake-up call. Racial injustices shook us to our core, highlighting systemic barriers affecting the lives of Black and Indigenous people, and People of Colour. These barriers hurt us as a society, but are particularly painful for members of underrepresented communities who face discrimination and lack equal access to opportunities. As an organization that values equality, inclusion and justice, we recognized our responsibility to help drive social change. We took new measures to address and eliminate systemic racism. To learn more, refer to pages 37-40.
Cyberattacks continued to impact people and organizations while making headlines in 2020. Most industries and stakeholders are understandably concerned about rising cybercrime and how to stay ahead of the risks. Sun Life continues to strengthen its defences and monitoring to prevent all types of cybercrime. To learn more, refer to pages 47 and 48.
In 2020, sustainability became a much bigger focus. More Clients, investors, rating firms and regulators wanted more information on company strategies and performance across a host of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. Sun Life expanded its ESG reporting. We have begun disclosing in-line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (in our Annual Report). We continue to align our reporting with the GRI Standards and for the first time are reporting on relevant Sustainability Accounting Standards Board metrics.
The World Health Organization estimates that 450 million people currently struggle with mental illness. It’s the leading cause of disability worldwide.1 The global pandemic amplified the problem. It disrupted mental health services in many countries at a time when demand for these services skyrocketed. In 2020, Sun Life increased investments to boost mental health support. To learn more, refer to pages 16-23.

HOME / Introduction Message from the President and CEO. 
Through our asset management businesses, we support sustainable investments that contribute to the transition to a low-carbon and more inclusive economy. We have committed to $20 billion in new sustainable investments over the next five years in assets and businesses that support this transition. Last year, we completed our majority acquisition of InfraRed Capital Partners. InfraRed invests in infrastructure projects, including renewable energy, and the addition broadens SLC Management's alternative investment solutions for institutional Clients.
Our Canadian Group Retirement Services business introduced a new Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) evaluation framework that helps our Clients make informed decisions for sustainable investing.
Diversity, equity and inclusion is an essential driver of a resilient and sustainable business. At Sun Life, we are making the changes to create a place where everyone is treated fairly and respectfully, has equal access to opportunities and resources, and can fully contribute their thoughts, beliefs, perspectives and talent. We are committed to reaching gender parity, and to having 25% under-represented communities with specific goals for Black, Indigenous and People of Colour in senior management roles in North America by 2025.
We continue to push ourselves to achieve more on our sustainability journey. To guide our efforts, we align to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and five of the. 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): good health and well-being, gender equality, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth and climate action. We have also developed disclosures in line with recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).
I am proud of the actions we’ve taken during my tenure to become a more sustainable organization, but there’s so much more to do. Kevin Strain will succeed me as President and CEO in August 2021, and I know Kevin shares the same dedication and commitment to our sustainability journey.
Despite the challenges of the pandemic, we drove meaningful change in 2020. Through it all, we remained laser-focused on our purpose: to help our Clients achieve lifetime financial security and live healthier lives. Thank you to our employees and advisors for their commitment and dedication to help our Clients, our communities and each other through this extraordinary time.
Dean A. Connor. 
President & Chief Executive Officer. 
Broadening the availability of products and services is key to helping Clients increase their financial security.
In Asia, new digital solutions across the region, and two new bank distribution partnerships in Vietnam, made it easier for millions of Clients to get the coverage and advice they need.
As part of fostering healthier lives, we launched Lumino Health Virtual Care in Canada, which connects Clients with medical practitioners for virtual consultations. In the U.S., our Maxwell Health digital platform helped Clients enrol easily in the benefit choices they needed through their workplace. We also expanded our mental health programs and services to help Clients and employees during these challenging times.
2020 challenged us in ways we never imagined. The pandemic, Black Lives Matter and severe weather events cast a light on society's vulnerabilities, including access to health care, social unrest, systemic racism, diversity and inclusion, and climate change.
As a global industry leader, Sun Life has the responsibility and ability to create meaningful change in these areas. This has meant further embedding sustainability as a critical part of our business strategy.
In 2019, we launched a new purpose-led Sustainability Plan.
Our plan starts from a foundation as a trusted and responsible business. We then build on the areas where we can have the most significant impact: increasing financial security, fostering healthier lives and advancing sustainable investing.
This past year we took significant actions to progress our plan and achieve measurable outcomes.

Our Sustainability Plan. 
Advancing sustainability is a core strategic priority that supports our Purpose. We aspire to lead the global financial industry in helping to create a cleaner, more inclusive and more sustainable future. Our commitment to lead responds to global challenges and an increasing public desire for corporations to support sustainability. Strong sustainability initiatives and practices are crucial for business longevity and better outcomes for all.
Collaboration is a cornerstone of our approach. Along with people and partners from around the world, we work to support broader sustainability initiatives. We’re doing this in markets where we operate, as well as at the global level.
Sustainability Governance. 
Our governance and oversight of sustainability reflects its priority to Sun Life.
Our Executive Vice-President, Chief Legal Officer & Public Affairs serves as Executive Sponsor of Sustainability. She chairs our International Sustainability Council (ISC) and champions our strategy to maximize our positive impact on society while supporting business goals.
Executive Sponsor. 
The ISC is composed of senior executives from each of our businesses, key functions and regions. ISC members are responsible for implementation of our sustainability plan, through the areas of focus that align with their business. ISC members champion, influence and drive action. This group meets at least four times per year. ISC members also meet regularly in smaller groups to focus on specific areas of our sustainability plan.
One of the most prominent and ambitious campaigns we stand behind is the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) developed by the United Nations. The SDG framework is composed of 17 goals and 169 underlying targets. The SDGs aim to end poverty, advance human rights and protect the planet. For Sun Life, the SDGs embody many opportunities to offer innovative, sustainable solutions for a better world. They serve as a compass to better our own operations.
Sun Life focuses on supporting five SDGs where we believe we can have the greatest influence and impact. These are: • #3 Good health & well-being • #5 Gender equality • #7 Affordable and clean energy • #8 Decent work and economic growth • #13 Climate action. 
Read our separate report, Supporting the Sustainable Development Goals, to learn how we’re contributing to each of these SDGs.
International Sustainability Council. 
This team acts as a central resource and expert for all sustainability activities. The team manages the sustainability plan, its implementation and reporting of our global environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance. Supporting the team’s efforts is a network of sustainability champions from business groups and regions in which we operate.

FINANCIAL SECURITY / Financial security. 
Our experience shows that with greater knowledge and confidence, people can make better financial decisions. Across our regions, we’re increasing our financial education campaigns for Clients and community members. We use social media as a key platform to reach new segments and amplify the importance of being financially secure. Working one-on-one with Clients, advisors offer education on the importance of insurance, savings and investments. Advisors also help Clients build financial plans to meet their goals today and in the future.
1 World Economic Forum. “Investing in (and for) Our Future”. June 2019.
2 Natixis Investment Managers. “2020 Global Retirement Index”. September 2020.
3 Sun Life. “Nearly half of all Canadians feel less financially secure due to COVID-19”. September 2020.
4 Bain. “Making the Most of Asia-Pacific’s Insurance Boom.” May 2019.
Around the world, we see firsthand the importance of developing financial security. The need to help people create more stable and secure financial futures is growing: • The World Economic Forum projects retirees around the world will outlive their savings, with the highest burden being on women.1 • The economic and social effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are putting increasing pressure on retirement savings.2 The pandemic has also elevated financial stress: 45% Canadians surveyed in 2020 felt less financially secure than previously.3 • Many people around the world are underinsured or not insured at all. This leaves them and their dependents financially vulnerable.
Financial Security. 
Our Approach. 
We offer a broad range of protection and wealth products and services. Directly in line with our Purpose, they help our Clients and employees increase their lifetime financial security: • Insurance – including life, health, travel and stop-loss insurance products. These products give people a financial safety net, allowing them to protect themselves and their families in moments that matter; • Investments – including individual and workplace savings, investment, pension, mutual fund and annuity options. These options enable Clients to build savings and to enjoy their savings in retirement; and • Advice – including financial planning and retirement planning services.
Through our public policy and business activities, we also advocate for ways to improve financial resilience in society.
A key pillar of our sustainability plan is to expand and create new opportunities to boost financial security. It’s an area where Sun Life can make a real difference. To maximize our impact, we’re building on our strengths and focusing on three areas:
We’re using new technologies and innovative products to drive better financial habits and decisions. An example in Canada is our digital coach, Ella. She inspires our Clients and employees to take advantage of opportunities to save and prepare for the future. In the U.S., we offer the ability for plan sponsors to autoenroll their employees for disability coverage. In Hong Kong, we provide Clients and the broader community with education, guidance and digital tools like the Retirement Journey Planner to help them achieve ideal retirement results.
1. Driving positive financial action. 
In some countries where we operate, life insurance penetration is low. In fact, it’s as low as 2%.4 The opportunity to help people gain access to affordable insurance represents huge growth potential for any insurer that can help bridge this significant coverage gap. We’ve introduced new micro-insurance solutions and distribution channels to support underserved and low-income people. In Malaysia, for example, our microinsurance product, GOLIFE, helps consumers access affordable insurance.

FINANCIAL SECURITY / Financial security. 
SUPPORTING FINANCIAL RESILIENCE DURING THE PANDEMIC • Offered grace periods for premium payments for individual and group benefits Clients. We offered rebates and credits to group benefits Clients. We also expedited payments to Clients and beneficiaries who were facing financial uncertainty.
• Extended benefits coverage limits (for example, for hospital stays) and covered services at more hospitals and clinics. In Asia, we waived wait periods and continued coverage for policies that lapsed due to quarantine or hospitalization.
• Broadened the documentation and identification Clients could use to access their savings easily. This was particularly significant when Clients couldn’t get their documents certified due to the pandemic.
• Expanded options to help U.S. plan members who were temporarily laid off keep their benefits coverage.
• Worked with the non-profit Credit Counselling Society to offer free credit counselling and debt management services for plan members in Canada. More than 350 Clients benefitted from this offering.
• Added COVID-19 coverage to U.S. critical illness policies. We also launched COVID-19 outbreak coverage and related stop-loss insurance products. Both products serve needs of self-funded employers in the U.S. These new solutions allow employers to focus on creating a safe working environment for employees, with protection for higher-than-expected plan costs associated with COVID-19.
• Worked with regulators to develop flexible administrative and funding relief options for Sun Life Canada's Group Retirement Services (GRS) Clients. These solutions allowed them to maintain their plans and support the financial security of their employees.
• Worked with U.S. Congress to ensure that businesses taking Paycheck Protection Program loans can use the funds to continue providing benefits for their employees.
• Supported GRS plan members in sticking with their plans through market volatility caused by the pandemic. Plan members saw the value in their Sun Life plan, as only 2.5% made fund changes during this period.
• Created more than USD$16.2 million in savings for Sun Life and our stop-loss Clients through our Clinical 360 program in the U.S. The program combines data analytics with clinical experts who act as a second set of eyes for our Clients to identify cost savings and opportunities to improve care. This work leads to better treatment outcomes for plan members and lower costs for our Clients.
• Spearheaded initiatives to encourage retirement readiness among Hong Kong millennials. For example, we introduced “Sunny”, a digital retirement planning buddy. Sunny helps people explore suitable solutions and gain retirement planning knowledge.
2020 Highlights. 
DRIVING POSITIVE FINANCIAL ACTION • Helped Clients in Canada take 1.2 million positive financial actions. For example, thanks to Ella, our digital coach, Clients placed $700 million in savings products and obtained $1 billion of insurance coverage.
• Launched Times & Dimes, a Sun Life podcast available on Spotify. Each episode examines the emotional impact of money and how it affects our lives. In the podcast, Canadians share their struggles and successes.
• Launched a campaign to empower Canadians to achieve their financial, physical and mental health goals. “Let’s get you there” helps people set goals and stay on track for a happy, healthy life. The site offers advice, tools, online resources and connections to a network of advisors across the country.
INCREASING ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE INSURANCE • Introduced hospital indemnity insurance in the U.S. to help offset the high out-of-pocket costs for long hospital stays. This new coverage brings people financial and medical security during a time when they need it most.
• Expanded low-cost insurance options for consumers in the Philippines and Indonesia, through strategic partnerships with MediCard and LinkAja. Refer to the case study on page 14 for details.
microinsurance policies issued to date, including 31,800 in 2020 118,600 positive financial actions taken by Clients in Canada towards financial security.
Examples include:
Working with an advisor to set up a financial plan. 
Adding a voluntary benefits product such as life insurance. 
Increasing payroll contributions to a workplace savings plan for at least three months 1.2 million 13.

CASE STUDY. 
Improving financial inclusion is a priority for Sun Life, particularly in Asia. We’re helping more people, including underserved and lower-income populations, get access to good, low-cost insurance.
In 2020, Sun Life Philippines teamed up with MediCard to offer more affordable personal accident insurance to Filipinos. For only P20.00, qualified Health Check members can avail a one-year personal accident insurance coverage worth P20,000. This coverage provides financial protection in case of loss of life, dismemberment and loss of sight due to an accident.
In Indonesia, we partnered with financial technology company, LinkAja, to leverage their digital distribution channels. Together, we’re expanding access to insurance products through their digital apps, with nearly 10,000 policies sold in 2020.
We also continue to provide low-cost insurance solutions for Clients through partnerships with Lazada (Philippines) and U Mobile (Malaysia).

HEALTHIER LIVES / Client health 1 Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. “Workplace mental health playbook for business leaders”. 2020.
2 Sun Life. “Designed for health: A focus on mental health disability claims”. 2020.
As a company that offers life, health and disability insurance, we know good health is central to overall well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic underscored that. We see first-hand the effect that access to health services and support tools has on Client health, including mental wellness.
Client Health. 
Our Approach. 
We’re committed to being a partner for Clients throughout their health journey. We offer a growing suite of resources, including innovative wellness apps, health education and voice technology powered by artificial intelligence. These resources inspire and encourage healthier living and help Clients find the right support.
Mental health is one of the key issues of our time. That’s why we’ve made it a priority in many of our businesses and regions. According to Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), half a million Canadians miss work each week due to mental illness.1 Sun Life’s own claims data confirms that mental healthrelated disability claims are increasing.2 We continue to prioritize mental health for Clients. Our focus is on removing barriers to effective treatment and recovery. We collaborate with renowned health-care leaders and organizations in the field and help companies create healthy workplaces for their employees.
Virtual care is revolutionizing the health-care landscape. More people are turning to electronic devices to address their health concerns and connect with medical professionals virtually. The COVID-19 crisis transformed an emerging trend into an essential service for many. Sun Life continues to invest in virtual care solutions. They empower our Clients to better manage their health and well-being.
Many of our solutions centre on access to care and helping Clients get back to productive work after illness or injury. Examples include:
This service helps injured or ill U.S. Clients in an employer disability plan remain productive at work or return to work, when appropriate. It provides resources to assist with medical limitations and helps employers manage productivity. We also help Clients find and train for new employment if they can no longer perform their prior job.
Workplace accommodation consultative service:
This service helps Clients on disability leave overcome obstacles in getting physician specialist care and treatment within the health-care system. In Canada, this service is available through Medical Confidence Inc.
Health-care navigation service:
We are leaders in offering access to virtual health-care services in Canada. From the comfort of their home, Canadian Clients can get immediate care. Virtual health-care visits can be with a doctor, nurse or other healthcare professional by live video or telephone.
Virtual health care on demand:
Sun Life Malaysia helps Clients live healthier lives using a mobile app. The app encourages Clients to stay active and live healthy, ultimately developing a more health-conscious society.

Work-family balance is so important these days. Employees first is a reality at Sun Life; maybe a competitive advantage too.
HEALTHIER LIVES / Employee wellness. 
Our global wellness offerings include: • benefit plans to support the health of employees and their families; • Employee Assistance Program (EAP), with free, 24/7 access to third-party confidential advice and help for employees and their families; • paid and unpaid time off to promote mental health and provide work/life balance; • flexible work options to allow employees to choose where, when and how they work.

Through our Global Wellness Strategy, we aim to drive a culture of health and well-being for employees worldwide. In line with Sun Life’s Purpose, the global strategy centres on three pillars – mental, physical and financial wellness.
Physical Wellness. 
Mental Wellness. 
Financial Wellness. 
Employee wellness underpins our ability to deliver excellent service to Clients and to attract and retain top talent. It also helps to support our high-performance culture.
We’ve been fostering employee wellness for years. The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the importance of our wellness programs to Sun Life’s resilience. That’s especially true for programs focusing on mental health.
Employee Wellness • retirement and savings plans to help employees build financial security for the future; and • a Benevolent Fund to help employees facing unforeseen financial difficulties.

I am helping my older parents and the time they need can be overwhelming. At the moment, neither parent can drive, so I am trying to accommodate work, their doctors appointments and my own appointments. Knowing Sun Life is making Flexibility 2.0 an option for its staff is helping people like me and my family - thank you!
MENTAL WELLNESS • Reminded employees of the EAP and other resources available to them. In Asia and the U.S., we arranged access to mental health webinars through our EAP and other providers.
• Fast-tracked our mental health investments for Canadian employees. Actions included launching people leader training, encouraging mental health virtual check-ins, and offering resilience training for employees. Refer to the case study on page 20.
• Encouraged employees to adopt healthy meeting practices while working remotely. Examples include meeting-free lunch hours and Friday afternoons. We also supported more flexible work schedules.
• Introduced Flexibility 2.0 and a virtual summer camp program in the U.S. These programs offer flexible work arrangements and resources to support parents and caregivers while working remotely.
• Launched a parental support network for families to connect during these challenging times.
• Encouraged Canadian employees to sign up for Lumino Health Virtual Care powered by Dialogue. This free app from Sun Life connects users with health-care professionals, innovators and resources.
• Provided all Sun Life employees with paid wellness days. Wellness days allowed employees to step away from the stresses of work during the pandemic.

Amid the global pandemic, our employees faced new challenges in their work and personal lives. To support them, we accelerated and invested in new wellness programs and initiatives. We have also adapted existing ones. At the same time, we made progress on our 2020 priorities to invest in long-term programs that support employee wellness.
1Based on 2020 COVID-19 employee surveys.
FINANCIAL WELLNESS • Incorporated automatic enrollment in our retirement plan for all new Canadian employees. This change helps employees to start saving for retirement right away and get full advantage of the company match, instead of needing to take the initiative to enroll. In addition, we added a Registered Education Savings Plan option to help employees save for their children’s future schooling. For some, the pandemic brought protection gaps into sharper focus. We made a change to allow employees to increase optional life insurance and critical illness coverage at any time during the year.
• Supported initiatives to help employees manage extra costs and financial challenges caused by the pandemic. The temporary programs differed by region and need. Examples include: • maintaining salaries for employees who could not work because their jobs could not be done from home, • extending paid emergency leave, • covering some home office expenses to support employees working from home, and • allowing COVID-impacted U.S. employees to temporarily access more of their 401(k) accounts.
PHYSICAL WELLNESS • Held events in each country to promote physical wellness. Events ranged from virtual runs in Indonesia and Vietnam, to step challenges in Canada and the U.S. In the Philippines, our employees participated in a challenge to reach 1.25 billion steps in 2020. This event was one of the many activities held to mark Sun Life's 125th anniversary in the Philippines.
• Improved access to care so employees could maintain and improve their health. For example, we: • expanded virtual health-care coverage in Canada and the U.S.; • offered a health app in Hong Kong, promoting healthy living; and • waived member cost sharing in the U.S. for testing and treatment of eligible COVID-19 services.
• Offered all Canadian employees and their families virtual fitness classes and stretch breaks as we moved to remote work.

Accelerating our 2020 priority to support employee mental health in Canada. 
CASE STUDY. 
Mental health programs have long been a key pillar of our Canadian employee wellness programs and investment. Benefit plan enhancements launched in previous years (e.g., expanded psychology coverage, virtual therapy) showed good promise. But mental health claims continue to be a top driver of employee disability at Sun Life.
Mental wellness was a top 2020 priority for Sun Life in Canada – even before the pandemic emerged. The isolation and stresses of COVID-19 led us to speed up and intensify our employee mental health plans. In our 2020 COVID-19 employee surveys, 57% of employees in Canada said they were feeling anxious or nervous due to COVID-19. However, 92% also said they have confidence senior leaders will prioritize their mental health and well-being.
We defined a new vision: Sun Life empowers and supports its employees to achieve optimal mental well-being. We established a long-term roadmap to help achieve our vision.
• hosting regular “Ask Me Anything” sessions and webinars, often focused on external mental health. These dialogues featured in-house psychologists and external mental health advocates such as Canadian champion rower Silken Laumann; and • supporting Mental Health Week in Canada. Canadian employees contributed to the #GetReal about how you feel campaign. It encouraged others to understand it’s OK not to be OK in these times.
Staci Werbin-Tanner, Director, National Accounts, Sun Life Canada. 
Sun Life has been providing us with so many tools to have a healthy lifestyle: virtual health care, wellness incentives, and information surrounding mental wellness.
We were always a firm that was amazing with work-life balance. But they have truly shown during this pandemic we can do this!
The roadmap includes offering leading mental health benefits for employees and increasing our focus on data. We’ll use the data to inform the mental health strategy on an ongoing basis, adapting to evolving employee needs.
Talking about mental health in the workplace has always been a challenge. In 2020, we brought this issue into the spotlight by supporting and encouraging employees to openly share their experiences. We initiated several actions that included: • reminding employees about available resources, including the EAP and Lumino Health network; • piloting and quickly expanding mandatory training webinars. We took these steps to help our people leaders support their teams’, as well as their own mental well-being; 2020 GOALS RESULTS • Increase flexibility in employee benefits in select Asia countries • Develop targeted programs in Canada to support employee mental well-being • Implement defined contribution plan auto-enrollment for new hires in Canada √ Achieved – expanded benefits choices in Hong Kong and the Philippines √ Achieved √ Completed 2021 GOALS • Launch benefit plan enhancements in the U.S. to support healthy living • Advance the mental health strategy in Canada to promote mental health and support recovery.

We have a vested interest in contributing to the health and well-being of communities we serve. Our Clients, employees and their families live and work in these communities. That means our shared success depends on supporting their development and sustainability.
Community Wellness 1 International Diabetes Federation. “IDF Diabetes Atlas Ninth edition 2019”. 2019. 
A global crisis1 463 million adults worldwide have diabetes. 4.2 million estimated deaths from diabetes and its complications in 2019.
USD$1.31 trillion total global estimated cost of diabetes in 2015.
USD$760 billion total estimated spend on diabetes care in 2019.
90% of diabetics have type 2 diabetes.
WHY DIABETES? Diabetes now affects over 463 million people worldwide.1 That’s one person in 11 and the numbers are expected to double in the next 20 years. Diabetes is a chronic health condition that can lead to even worse health problems. It can cause diseases of the heart, blood vessels, kidneys, eyes and limbs. Diabetes even influences our cancer risk and mental health.
The good news is, in many cases, Type 2 diabetes can be prevented. That’s why Sun Life aims to slow the advance of diabetes and its related complications by boosting the health and wellness of our Clients, employees and the community. We have focused our corporate giving on diabetes awareness, prevention and care. To date, we have contributed over $38 million to the cause globally. These donations include support for our flagship Team Up Against Diabetes global program.
Sun Life employees and advisors embrace diabetes as our signature cause. They volunteer, donate to and participate in local diabetes initiatives. In addition, we support employees’ community work, tailored to regional needs.
Our Approach. 
Sun Life has a long-standing focus on community health and wellness. We invest in initiatives that encourage healthy and active living in our communities, as well as help create a more inclusive society. We also partner with community organizations that align with our corporate giving values. We’re not only donating, but also striving to make a real, positive difference. We do this by harnessing the full breadth of our resources, including our people and expertise, to generate a positive impact.
In 2012, we announced our commitment to the fight against diabetes. Diabetes is a global epidemic and affects over 463 million people worldwide.1. 
In North America, for example, we match employee donations and pay registration fees to take part in health-related charitable events.
Beyond our philanthropic investments, we support community health and wellness in other ways. For example, Sun Life offers health and wellness resources to Canadians through its Lumino Health network. This free digital tool empowers people to connect with health-care providers and resources. It helps them take charge of their health journey.

SUSTAINABLE INVESTING / ESG integration 1 Friede,G., Busch, T.,Bassen, A.. “ESG and Financial Performance: Aggregated Evidence from More than 2000 Empirical Studies”. Oct 2015.

3 For copies of our 2020 PRI Transparency and Assessment reports, please contact sustainability@sunlife.com.
Both SLC Management and MFS engage with organizations in which they invest to promote sustainability. This engagement may take the form of: • encouraging greater disclosure, • seeking management support of sustainability, or • exercising voting rights in support of sustainability initiatives, in some cases.
Owning and engaging with companies to improve their ESG performance can sometimes be a more effective path to positive outcomes for our investment portfolio and for other stakeholders than exclusion and divestment. Engagement has prompted companies to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and their overall environmental impact. This is particularly true in relation to fossil fuel companies.
Sun Life and the companies in our Asset Management group are all signatories to the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). Sun Life is the largest insurance asset owner signatory in Canada by AUM. Please refer to the websites of each Asset Management business for more details on their specific ESG integration strategies.
Our world is increasingly being challenged by ESG issues, from climate change to social inequality. Integrating ESG factors helps us manage sustainability risks in our investment portfolios. It also helps us identify opportunities. Research shows that the consideration of ESG criteria has a positive or neutral effect on financial performance.1 The pandemic has put a spotlight on sustainable investing. In particular, the focus is on how well companies are able to anticipate and react quickly to ESG issues.
ESG Integration. 
We’re committed to ESG integration. We believe that looking at investments through an ESG lens leads to superior financial results over the long term. We apply this thinking for our Clients’ assets and the assets we own in our general account. ESG is not only about avoiding investments that are less sustainable. It’s also a critical lens for identifying strong investment opportunities.
Each of our asset management businesses supports and contributes to Sun Life’s commitment to sustainable investing. But they may take their own approach. The underlying business value proposition and the asset classes they invest in guides each business's strategy and investment decision-making.
While their approaches and activities around ESG integration vary, all of the businesses: • apply ESG considerations to the data and research rigour they rely on for investment success, • recognize the connection between ESG and value, • integrate ESG factors in their investment analyses and processes to identify risks and opportunities, and • favour engagement over divestment when appropriate, using dialogue and collaboration with company management.
Our Approach • Continued to meet our commitments as signatories to PRI. Sun Life and its asset management businesses scored “A” or higher on all modules for asset classes that represent 10% or more of AUM. SLC Management scored “E” on the listed equity – active ownership module which is optional as this asset class represents less than 1% of its AUM, well below the 10% threshold at which reporting on this asset class would be required.2,3 • The Sun Life General Account scored its best result ever in the GRESB Real Estate Benchmark, placing 2nd in Canada and 6th globally for the Diversified, Non-listed, Core peer group.
• SLC Management named one of the Best Places to Work in Money Management by Pensions & Investments.
• MFS named ESG/SRI Provider of the Year at the 9th annual Irish Pensions Awards for the second consecutive year. The Responsible Investment Brand Index also named MFS one of the top 10 fund houses genuinely committed to ESG.
• Sun Life applied ESG analysis to 100% of its internally managed active investment grade public corporate bond general account assets during both initial and ongoing reviews.

SUSTAINABLE INVESTING / Sustainable investments and products. 
Sun Life is an asset owner and global asset manager. We have the opportunity to invest in highimpact assets and businesses contributing to a low-carbon and more inclusive economy. Our role also enables us to provide sustainable investing opportunities for Clients. We’re seeing a massive shift in the investment world. More and more, institutional Clients and the broader investment community are seeking sustainability-themed investments.
Sustainable Investments and Products. 
We offer Clients sustainable investing opportunities. We also commit to investing our own assets to support the transition to a low-carbon and inclusive economy. Each of our asset management businesses contributes to these goals in different ways.
Supporting Client interest in sustainable investing Across our businesses there is a range of products, policies, practices and governance controls around sustainable investing. For example: • For institutional Clients, such as pension plans, foundations and insurance companies, SLC Management integrates ESG considerations into investment analysis. This analysis covers public and private fixed income, infrastructure and real estate equity and debt. • For retail investors, SLGI Asset Management Inc. (SLGI) works with investment managers around the world to offer a diverse line-up of managed solutions and mutual funds, integrating ESG considerations into manager selection and oversight. • Through our Group Retirement Services business in Canada, we offer plan sponsors access to sustainable investment options. Plan sponsors can then make these options available to their employees. • To help all investors with their decisionmaking, MFS produces company-specific, sectoral and thematic ESG research.
We are the first life insurer globally to issue a sustainability bond. Sun Life issued a $750 million, 10-year sustainability bond in 2019. The bond supports investments in green assets and other assets serving a broader social purpose. The transaction attracted positive feedback and strong investor demand.
Choosing sustainable investments for Sun Life As an organization, Sun Life makes investments too. We hold a portfolio of investments valued at $177.9 billion in our general account. We strive to ensure that these investments are aligned with business objectives including meeting policyholder obligations.
We’re committed to investing sustainably. ESG has become a critical lens for choosing our investments and structuring our portfolios. Sustainable infrastructure is a particular emphasis for our organization. We have more than $60 billion in total assets under management in sustainable investments across our asset management businesses. There’s an enormous societal need for infrastructure spending, to improve everything from hospitals to transportation to power generation that supports the transition to a low-carbon economy.
In Canada, we’re one of the biggest financers of private sustainable infrastructure, providing long-term private capital to support construction, operation and maintenance. SLC Management works with governments, other businesses, local communities and Clients to help bring such projects to fruition and ensure they achieve strong sustainable value. There are six areas of focus for our sustainable infrastructure investments: • renewable energy, • energy efficiency, • sustainable/green buildings, • clean transportation, • sustainable water management, and • access to essential services.
Sun Life also actively buys green bonds and other forms of social finance lending across the globe. Across our asset management businesses and general account, we have $2.6 billion in green, social and sustainability bond holdings. As well, we have invested in a private equity mandate focused on clean energy in China. The fund invests in clean energy and green businesses identified as helping to address environmental pollution in the country.

SUSTAINABLE INVESTING / Sustainable investments and products 2020 Highlights • Launched BentallGreenOak’s proprietary social impact assessment tool. The tool was developed to help assess the social impacts of investments, with the aim to: 1. integrate social impacts into decision making, 2. build social sustainability awareness and literacy, and 3. improve portfolio social sustainability performance over time.
In 2020, BentallGreenOak used this tool to assess the social impacts of over 400 properties, across four funds.
• Broadened investment capabilities to provide our Clients with a wider range of investment opportunities. For example, we: • Acquired InfraRed Capital Partners (InfraRed), a global infrastructure and real estate investment manager headquartered in London. Over the past 30 years, InfraRed has established itself as a highly successful developer and custodian of core infrastructure, renewable energy and real estate assets that play a vital role in supporting sustainable communities. • Announced our intent to acquire Crescent Capital Group (Crescent), a global alternative credit asset management firm. The transaction closed January 5, 2021.
• Introduced new ESG investment options for investors. For example: • Sun Life Asset Management launched an ESG Index Fund in Hong Kong. It brings the first Hang Seng ESG 50 Index fund to retail investors in the country. • InfraRed developed a new fund focused on sustainable investments in renewable energy and core infrastructure in Europe. They are also pursuing an energy transition strategy in North America focused on renewable energy generation and energy storage solutions.
• Continued to decrease our investments in coal-fired power producers in Malaysia with a 6.5% reduction this year. At the same time, we recognize that fossil fuels such as coal and gas continue to be important to meet the country’s electricity demand in the near- to medium-term.

For example, we funded: • an investment with a large non-profit to provide temporary housing and holistic social services for men experiencing homelessness, • energy and water efficiency projects across several school buildings for a K-12 public school district, and • smart meter installations for residential and commercial properties across the UK, allowing end-users to manage their energy use more efficiently.

Proactive contact We are both increasing and personalizing our Client outreach, in ways that make the most sense to each Client. That could be through an advisor, in person or by phone, videoconference, email, digital apps, text or social media.
Superior Client service We view any issues that Clients may have as opportunities to create positive experiences. Across Sun Life, we have processes to handle concerns and complaints while ensuring we learn and improve from them. For example, in Canada our goal is to resolve Client problems within our problem resolution teams.

TRUSTED AND RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS / Client focus 2020 Highlights • Supported transparency and clarity in financial communications with our plain language initiative. This is an ongoing international priority. In Canada alone, we rewrote 1,200 documents in 2020 to make information more clear and understandable for our Clients. These documents ranged from letters to Clients to insurance forms.
• Worked with regulators to help shape the Fair Treatment of Customers legislation in Canada. The new law will set the bar for fair dealings by all insurers. Within Sun Life, we advanced our understanding of mental health issues to ensure our practices are progressive and supportive. We also continued to build our awareness of gender diversity issues and best practices, to ensure we’re inclusive in all our dealings.
PROACTIVE CONTACT • Reached out to our Clients’ families in Canada who were affected by the Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 disaster. We wanted to do what we could to help them while expressing compassion and empathy. For example, we set up a special number and email address for their families to connect with us. Together with Global Affairs Canada, we also engaged and influenced other insurers in Canada to make contact with victims’ families.
This year, we recognized that many of our Clients faced more difficulties because of COVID-19 and lockdowns. We committed to helping them through it. We worked hard to be proactive, visible and relevant. Our roles enable us to be there for our Clients at some of the best and worst times in their lives.
EASY TO DO BUSINESS WITH • Expanded our digital offerings to make managing health and wealth easier for Clients, particularly through the pandemic. Our prior digital investments continue to serve us well and among our new initiatives to provide a seamless, virtual experience, we: • Introduced virtual insurance enrollment in several markets, as well as more forms that take e-signatures. These enhancements make it easier to get insurance any time, on any device, securely and virtually.
• Shared new features on our Client communication platforms to allow Clients to connect on-demand and virtually with an advisor. In the U.S., we introduced text messaging and live chat features on our Maxwell Health digital benefits platform to provide fast and easy support to Clients at a time when they had more questions and needs. Apps like My Sun Life HK allow Clients to manage their health and wealth protection from the comfort of home.
• Launched new digital tools, like Vietnam’s Sun Fast and Canada’s Sun eApp to make insurance applications easier and faster. With the Sun eApp Clients receive a decision on their application in as little as 24 hours.
218 process changes launched in Canada alone to support thousands of Clients during the pandemic • Offered a remote online medical exam service in the Philippines. This service is to help Clients unable to visit a clinic be a step closer to securing an insurance policy in the safety and comfort of their own homes.
• Extended accelerated underwriting in Canada. Accelerated underwriting uses artificial intelligence to determine if Clients need any medical tests to support insurance applications. We can now use this process for applications from people of a wider range of ages and for higher coverage amounts than before. This improvement makes it easier for Clients to get the coverage they need.

Listening to Clients during the pandemic. 
In 2020, we did a COVID-19 Client pulse survey. We wanted to find out how the pandemic has affected our Clients. We also wanted to know how they felt about Sun Life’s response to date and what more we could do to support them.
CASE STUDY However, those that were aware of Sun Life’s efforts during the crisis were substantially more likely to view us in a more positive light.
Sun Life stays in touch with its clients, even if just to say "hang in there" and "is there anything we can help you with?" Communication is one of the most important things in uncertain times - thank you!
Canada Group Benefits Member. 
I have had no interruption of my claims payments/contacts during this time. It has been business as usual.
U.S. Business Client. 
Sun Life is concerned about the health of their employees and also their customers, that’s why I think they are very effective amid covid19.
Philippines Retail Client. 
The findings confirmed that the pandemic has taken a significant toll on our Clients’ overall well-being. Clients across the globe were pleased with Sun Life’s performance through the crisis. We exceeded expectations in two key areas that are important to our Clients: • maintaining our service levels, and • showing care and empathy towards our own employees in the face of so much upheaval.
The large majority of our Clients globally say their opinion of Sun Life has not changed since before the pandemic.
• Engaged Clients through our online forums in North America and our insights communities in Hong Kong and the Philippines. These channels help us gather real-time input and feedback to guide our work. For instance, over 700 U.S. employers and brokers/consultants participated in our proprietary “Voices” online community. We: • shared product prototypes for feedback, • gauged interest in new solutions, and • sought information on how Clients’ needs might be changing.
Clients found the Voices community to be receptive and informative, yielding an 89% satisfaction rating.
• Expanded proactive outreach to U.S. employers, adding thousands of touchpoints in 2020. We also reached out as a result of the pandemic to advise employers about the insurance policy accommodations we offered. Along with individual contacts, we provided 31 employer webinars. They offered solutions for COVID-19 disruptions, updates on compliance, regulatory changes and financial relief programs, and guidance on helping employees cope during times of stress. These webinars reached over 44,000 employers and brokers.
SUPERIOR CLIENT SERVICE • Launched a Client experience quality program in Canada to improve and measure our problem resolution process.
• Experienced a 5% decrease in complaints investigated by our internal ombuds office in Canada. That’s an improvement from 153 cases in 2019 to 146 in 2020.
• Continued to effectively resolve Client issues in the U.S. as measured by post problem resolution Client surveys. 94% of Clients were satisfied, up from 85% in 2019.
• Piloted a program in Canada that used our problem resolution data to predict problems before they occurred. That allowed us to reach out to Clients and avoid inconveniences for them.
2020 GOALS RESULTS • Continue to make Sun Life easier to do business with by using new technology platforms and capabilities • Work with regulators to implement regulation focused on fair treatment of consumers √ Achieved √ Achieved; work is ongoing 2021 GOALS • Continue to improve our Client experience index score • Make it easier for our Clients to have their problems resolved • Continue to digitalize our processes to make it easier for Clients to do business with us.

TRUSTED AND RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS / Talent management. 
There is a pressing need to find and nurture next-gen employees and leaders. They are the future of our business and they inspire us with fresh ideas to meet Client needs.
We have many programs to help us ensure a strong pipeline of talent: • practical learning opportunities for people still in school (co-op and work-study arrangements); • Rotational Leadership Development Program: gives new grads the opportunity to explore different roles at Sun Life; • internal online talent marketplace: matches employees with short-term opportunities to build new experiences and develop skills. Also balances supply and demand of the workforce; • experience leadership program: fast tracks the development of top-talent Directors into roles that are more senior;
Talent and culture is one of Sun Life’s six strategic focus areas. It’s about hiring people with the right skills and investing in their development. It’s about making their jobs meaningful, rewarding and engaging. We also want our employees to feel motivated in their work. When they are, we believe they’ll be more productive and passionate in delivering on our Purpose.
Talent Management. 
Our Approach. 
We’re committed to creating inclusive, sustainable and empowering workplaces where employees can be themselves and reach their potential. The collaboration technologies and flexible learning approaches we offer support our employees working from any location. This includes working from home in most cases. Over the past few years, we’ve updated our workplaces to encourage new and diverse ways of working. We recognize there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach. Our model of open, bright and agile workspaces at many Sun Life locations reflects this thinking.
INVESTING IN THE NEXT GENERATION OF SUN LIFE EMPLOYEES. 
MORE INFO:
We encourage open, two-way dialogue with our employees and seek their input through various channels. These channels include: • a 360-degree feedback program, • performance reviews, • career planning sessions, • our social media platforms, and • surveys on specific topics including engagement.

TRUSTED AND RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS / Talent management 2020 Highlights • Temporarily transitioned more than 95% of employees to work from home and offered flexible, part-time or modified work. This allowed employees to work safely and balance other priorities during the pandemic. We were successful in this transition because of our existing tools and technology, combined with our business continuity planning.
• Launched Kaleidoscope, a diversity-focused social learning platform. It gives employees opportunities to discuss and engage on diversity topics with experts as well as peers. Refer to the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion section for more details.
• Adjusted our performance management approach to ensure equitable treatment given 2020’s pandemic-related challenges. We provided guidance for leaders to fairly measure contributions, considering workload and priority shifts and respecting employees’ personal obligations. We placed more emphasis on succession management activities with a focus on emergency succession in response to risks brought on by the pandemic.
• Invested $26 million in employee training and development. This amount is lower than the previous year. Throughout most of 2020, external training events and conferences were cancelled because of the pandemic. We provided training for our people leaders on how to manage their teams virtually. We also educated employees on how to successfully work from home.
• Achieved an 89% score in our 2020 Global Employee Engagement Check-in Survey, which is above the global financial services norm.2 This survey measures key factors that contribute to employee performance and their overall experience. Almost 80% of our employees took part in the survey.
• Introduced an internal online talent marketplace. It matches employees who are looking to gain new skills, with short-term opportunities outside of their core team. The pandemic highlighted the opportunity to redeploy employees across business areas to adjust for peak demand.

TRUSTED AND RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS / Diversity, equity and inclusion. 
Fostering diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) is the responsible thing to do, but it’s much more than that. It helps our Clients, colleagues and communities shine. And companies with inclusive cultures and diverse teams are more likely to be innovative, collaborative and agile.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. 
AREA OF FOCUS GOAL KEY ACTIONS Commitments and memberships. 
CLIENTS. 
Better reflect and understand the unique needs of our Clients across all lines of business and locations • Inclusive marketing and advertising • Employee education on how to inclusively serve our Clients • Multilingual information materials and services • Internal inclusion networks focused on building community and awareness of diverse Client needs • Inclusive products (e.g., gender affirmation benefits, virtual access to mental health care)
COLLEAGUES. 
Build the foundation for a respectful workplace through inclusive policies, practices, awareness and education • Intensive diversity training for our executive team • Canadian and U.S. task forces to accelerate our DE&I strategies and measure outcomes • Inclusive policies and practices • Diversity targets for women, underrepresented ethnicities and board members • Development and mentoring programs for diverse talent • Training and peer learning on DE&I topics, to help employees embed acts of inclusion into their behaviours • Employee engagement initiatives, including internal forums for fostering learning and discussion • Accessible offices, ergonomic solutions and assistive technologies • DE&I metrics to gauge progress. 
COMMUNITIES. 
Promote more inclusive communities • Donating to and sponsoring diversity causes and charities (e.g., Pride festivals, Women in Insurance STEM program) • Collaboration with groups and leaders working to build awareness and capability (e.g., Right to Play, University of Winnipeg, Canada Learning Code, William Osler Health System) • Supplier Diversity Program. 
Across Sun Life, our practices reflect a promise to be an inclusive business. We support diversity of all kinds – gender, race, religion, age, country of origin, sexual orientation, neuro and physical ability – and encourage diverse perspectives and beliefs. These practices help drive a respectful and inclusive workplace for our colleagues, better service to our Clients and engagement with our communities.
OUR FOCUS AREAS AND STRATEGY We focus our DE&I efforts on three areas: Clients, colleagues and communities (refer to sidebar for details). Our DE&I strategy has three priorities: 1. Make the most of data to inspire action: Use insights to find opportunities; track progress through advanced metrics. 2. Improve policies and practices: Foster a respectful workplace through inclusive policies, programming and education. 3. Focus on ownership and accountability: Build tools to support leaders and drive desired outcomes through accountability.

2020 Highlights. 
INCLUSIVE WORKPLACE • Continued to focus on leadership diversity: • 34% women in VP+ roles globally (target was 40%), and • 15% underrepresented ethnicities in VP+ roles in North America (target 25%).
Our workforce data tells us that we’re doing a relatively good job at recruiting diverse talent. But we have more to do. We need to create more growth opportunities and career development pathways to retain talent and build a strong, diverse leadership pipeline for the future.
• Set a new goal to increase the representation of women in senior management to 50% globally by 2025.
• Intensified our actions to achieve 25% representation of underrepresented ethnicities in senior management in North America by 2025. We have specific representation objectives for underrepresented communities, where we are particularly lagging.
• Created new committees in Canada, U.S. and Asia to accelerate our DE&I strategy. The committees created action plans on metrics and communicated our progress.
For details on Board diversity, refer to Governance and Ethics.
INCLUSION NETWORKS 3,500 employees are members of our internal inclusion networks. These employee-led communities offer an avenue for connecting, raising awareness and exchanging ideas.
PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS As a company that operates around the globe, upholding human rights is fundamental to being a trusted and responsible business. It’s vital to our ability to make all employees feel safe. It helps us mitigate risks in our supply chain. And it’s essential to advancing a more sustainable world.
We integrate human rights protections throughout our business. It starts with our global Code of Conduct. Our commitment is supported by policies on employment equity, health and safety, harassment and discrimination, and procurement. These policies help guide all of us at Sun Life, as well as our suppliers, in respecting human rights and applicable laws. We enforce zero tolerance for any forms of violence, harassment, discrimination and human trafficking, in both our workplace and supply chain.
Sun Life also has programs in place such as: • Mandatory and refresher employee training on various aspects of human rights • Supplier screening procedures that assess performance on human rights criteria such as labour practices • An Ethics Hotline for reporting human rights violations. 
We continue to assess our practices in this area. Learn more in Governance and Ethics.
Diversity is a fact. Inclusion is a choice. We need both if we're to reflect the communities we serve and deliver on our Purpose.
Rowena Chan, President, Sun Life Financial Distributors (Canada) Inc. and Senior Vice-President, Distribution. 
TRUSTED AND RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS / Diversity, equity and inclusion. 
We track our progress over time and identify areas for improvement by benchmarking against external best practices and monitoring various indicators of DE&I. One indicator we monitor relating to gender diversity is pay. One of Sun Life’s five guiding principles for compensation is to support fairness for all employees and reward top performance. We’re committed to ensuring managers make unbiased, performance-driven pay decisions. Supporting that commitment, we regularly review pay by gender. We also provide data on the diversity of our workforce to leaders across Sun Life. This data includes how we are progressing on representation and engagement survey results related to inclusive behaviours that contribute most to company culture. Refer to page 39 and ESG Performance Tables.
OUR DE&I VISION Our vision sees an environment where everyone: • is treated fairly and respectfully, • has equal access to opportunities and resources, and • can contribute their thoughts, beliefs, perspectives and talent fully.

• Introduced new internal forums to engage employees in conversations about racism, racial diversity and inclusion. Facilitated by senior leaders, these forums are safe spaces allowing our employees to share their personal stories and perspectives. These conversations will continue throughout 2021.
• Launched the Kaleidoscope program, by Hive Learning. Sun Life is the first insurer to introduce the leading interactive DE&I digital learning program. Kaleidoscope takes participants on a journey from awareness to action. The program embeds tiny, but powerful, acts of inclusion into participants’ daily behaviours and routines. This way of learning is proven to create behaviour change and help organizations develop a more inclusive culture. Over the past 18 months, we piloted the Kaleidoscope program with 1,500 employees in North America and Asia. We will continue to roll out the initiative in 2021.
• Introduced a new artificial intelligence resume-screening tool to minimize discrimination and bias while recommending top candidates. We also continued to focus on strengthening career paths and opportunities for diverse students. Of the 300 students hired in North America this year at Sun Life, over a quarter self-reported as ethnically diverse.
• Used focused leadership programming to encourage more women in our Asia Service Centre in India to aspire to leadership positions. For example, in partnership with an external agency, women received mentorship support from industry leaders in the region. Women also benefitted from a series of personal development master classes.
DIVERSE TALENT IN OUR WORKFORCE • Expanded analysis of total average pay by gender for roles at the same level, to include U.S. employees.
• In Canada, the results from the previous year were sustained (women earn 98-99 cents for every $1 earned by men), except at the executive level, where the gap increased to 5 cents. This gap was driven by a change in population – the departure of some lower-paid men and the promotion of women, with corresponding “developing” pay packages.
• In the U.S., our analysis showed women earn between 95 and 97 cents for every $1 earned by men depending on level. Demographic factors such as geographic location contribute to these differences as the cost of talent varies across the U.S.
We continue to heighten awareness of potential pay gaps through a tool that shows managers and HR how annual pay decisions (i.e., performance distribution, salary adjustments, annual incentive awards and long-term incentive grants) compare across women and men, as well as other diverse groups.
94 % of employees feel that Sun Life supports diversity in the workplace (recognizing and respecting the value of human differences)1.

During this challenging time, we spoke up to make a very public statement that Sun Life stands for equality, social change and justice. Our company has long maintained a DE&I strategy. But the Black Lives Matter movement caused us to mobilize in new ways, both at the executive level and across our employee population.
In 2020, we augmented many of our existing DE&I initiatives. Enhancements include additional support and services for employees, and solidifying our commitment to supporting underrepresented ethnicities. From expanding employee learning on DE&I topics to creating spaces for open and candid discussions about racial injustice and social changes, we are working to remove systemic barriers that negatively affect the lives of underrepresented communities.
Taking action against racism. 
In a year when the COVID-19 pandemic took centre stage, racial injustices and the ensuing street-filled social protests reminded all of us that the fight for true inclusion remains as critical as ever. Systemic racism is a serious, long-standing issue for society, as well as for businesses. This issue clearly reached a tipping point in 2020.
CASE STUDY INCLUSIVE SOCIETY: CLIENTS AND COMMUNITIES • Signed on to the goals in the BlackNorth Initiative. The Canadian Council of Business Leaders Against Anti-Black Systemic Racism leads this initiative. It aims to remove systemic barriers that negatively affect the lives of Black Canadians.
• Provided an extra $100,000 to support important needs identified in underrepresented communities in Canada. For instance, a portion of the funding will go towards Black researchers at the undergraduate and graduate levels (who are currently disproportionately underrepresented). The researchers will perform health research specific to the Black community, and in diabetes and mental health.
• Supplied $340,000 for community groups, including the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History & Culture in Washington, D.C. and the Canadian Race Relations Foundation. These organizations support underrepresented communities, with an emphasis on Black/African-American coalitions and social justice reform.
• Took more steps to encourage diverse suppliers as part of our competitive bidding process. We focused on increasing our relationships with vendors, suppliers and small businesses owned by underrepresented communities and women.
2020 GOALS RESULTS • Increase representation of women in Vice-President roles and above globally • Increase representation of underrepresented ethnicities in Vice-President roles and above in North America • Expand internal inclusion networks to our businesses in Asia. 
X Recorded minimal change in gender representation globally (1% decrease); however, our executive team achieved gender balance √
√
Achieved 1.5% increase. 
Made progress in establishing a Sun Life Pride chapter in the Philippines 2021 GOALS • Drive action towards our DE&I commitments and regional priorities • Strengthen mentoring, coaching and leadership sponsorship • Set up and begin using a framework to develop, advance and retain underrepresented talent • Develop outcome-based data and performance measurements to hold leaders accountable for our representation and culture objectives • Make progress towards 2025 diversity targets (50% women in Vice-President roles and above globally and 25% underrepresented ethnicities in Vice-President roles and above in North America)

TRUSTED AND RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS / Climate change and the environment • Focusing on reducing climate impact and strengthening the resilience of our own operations around the world, as well as the properties that we own in our investment portfolio; and • Advocating for better data and disclosures, so we can make better-informed assessments of climate-related risks.
We commit to working together across industries and with our Clients to contribute to solving this global challenge. We recognize that we don’t yet have the answers to this complex topic. Our strategy will evolve over time. We will build on our experience and on external developments.
We have a goal of reducing our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 30% by 2030 (based on tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per square foot, relative to a 2014 baseline).1 This goal focuses on all emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) in our corporate and investment real estate portfolios. In 2019, we met our goal to reduce GHG emissions intensity 20% by 20201 relative to a 2014 baseline one year ahead of schedule.
1 We use a rolling base year approach to track cumulative savings that account for acquisitions and divestments.
Two of the greatest threats we face today are a changing climate and natural resource depletion. These threats significantly affect our business and our stakeholders. Around the world, people are demanding that governments and corporations do more to fight climate change. A global pandemic has put even greater emphasis on our sustainability efforts.
Climate Change and the Environment. 
Our Approach. 
Slowing the climate crisis is a global priority. We have an important role to play. We must become more sustainable as a business and support the goal of the Paris Agreement to limit the global temperature increase in this century to well below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels. We need effective, collective action to address this challenge. The long-term resilience of society, and our Company, depends on it.
Our approach to tackling climate change involves: • Recognizing that as a long-term investor, we have the opportunity to be part of the solution to this global challenge and invest proactively in assets and businesses that support the transition to a lower-carbon economy. Refer to Sustainable Investments and Products; • Assessing climate-related impacts on our businesses and investments and adjusting accordingly, while acknowledging the challenges of uncertainty and imperfect data to inform such decisions; • Committing to continuously improving our climate-related measurement, monitoring and reporting. Refer to Risk Management and TCFD Disclosures in our 2020 Annual Report;
We’re working to understand and address potential climate change impacts to our business overall. For example, we assess the potential effects of various climate changerelated impacts on our office locations and investment properties. These include storms and flash floods. Each year, we update our business continuity plans to build in current and developing climate risks.
We review environmental risks within Sun Life’s Risk Management Framework (RMF). Our RMF outlines our risk management process for how we identify, measure, manage, monitor and report current and emerging risks. Refer to our Annual Report for more details on environmental risk.
In our asset management businesses, we consider environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks as part of our investment decisionmaking process. ESG risks include the physical and transition risks that climate change poses. Refer to ESG Integration for details.

ENVIRONMENT-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND MEMBERSHIPS. 
Council CLEAN CAPITALISM for. 
We commit to transparent reporting about our environmental progress and increasing our level of disclosure. We track and report on a number of key performance indicators annually (refer to ESG Performance Tables). Sun Life has disclosed its GHG emissions to the CDP since 2010. We have further expanded our disclosures by reporting in line with TCFD recommendations, in our 2020 Annual Report.
We’re monitoring our environmental program, setting new targets and piloting innovative ideas to improve our overall performance. We reward performance on goals related to our GHG reduction targets and other environmental achievements. For example, objectives related to our GHG reduction target are included in a senior executive’s annual incentive plan goals. Performance against these goals is a factor in determining overall compensation.
MEASURING AND REPORTING ON OUR ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE. 
TAKING ACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND BEYOND. 
We’re adapting our facilities and operations to a changing climate, including through enhanced risk management and building and infrastructure retrofits. We’re partnering with building owners and property managers. Proactively, we examine ways to build climate resilience and human wellness features in our corporate and investment real estate portfolios.
We continue to drive sustainable practices around water, paper and waste management in our operations. Our aim is to be a paperless company in our internal operations by 2030. We’re on the way to achieving that. We continue to improve waste diversion across our global footprint. And we’re reducing the use of plastics and other materials that pose environmental problems. Water use in our operations is minimal. We’ve reduced use where possible; for example, we use low-flow faucets and toilets in our offices, and in some cases, recycled water.
COMMITMENT AT ALL LEVELS OF THE ORGANIZATION. 
Environmental accountability is embedded in our governance structure. Refer to our GRI Index 103-2 for details.
Senior-level involvement ensures proper management and engagement throughout the business. Sun Life has integrated environmental considerations in our business planning and development, as showcased in our Sustainability Plan. Our International Sustainability Council (ISC) drives the implementation of the plan. We also have a dedicated senior executive steering committee that guides our implementation of the TCFD recommendations. Melissa Kennedy, Executive Vice-President, Chief Legal Officer & Public Affairs and Executive Sponsor of Sustainability chairs both the ISC and TCFD steering committee.
Employees play an important role in reducing negative environmental effects of our offices. We engage employees on environmental matters and empower them to take green actions. We encourage this behaviour, whether they’re in the workplace or working from home.
2 SLC Management and MFS are participating.
2 2020 Highlights. 
MITIGATING CLIMATE IMPACTS • Continued to work toward fully implementing TCFD recommendations. Refer to our 2020 Annual Report for our first TCFDaligned disclosures.
• Achieved carbon-neutral operations in our Basingstoke, UK office. Refer to the Sun Life of Canada UK website for more details.
• Installed a solar power plant at our Asia Service Centre in India. The plant will produce five to six percent of the location’s power needs. This will reduce our environmental footprint and help us rely less on the power grid. In India, the power grid supply is not able to meet demand. As a result, additional power is typically generated through fossil fuel burning. Our solar plant effectively offsets a modest amount of generator use and provides greener energy to the grid.

• Decreased GHG emissions intensity and energy use. In 2019 we had already achieved our 20% by 2020 GHG emissions intensity reduction target. That happened before lower building occupancy related to the pandemic affected our energy and emissions performance. Restrictions during the pandemic were responsible for much of the continued reductions in 2020. Our internal decision to support employees working from home for an extended time also helped.
We continued our energy savings and emission reduction programs. We also adapted to maximize savings in buildings that were empty or in use by very few people. A few highlights: • Decreased GHG emissions intensity3,4 by 18.3% vs. 2019. We remain on track to meet our longer-term 30% by 2030 target.5-7 • Decreased absolute GHG emissions3 by 9,630 tCO2e vs. 2019. • Decreased energy use intensity3,8 by 10.7% vs. 2019. • Decreased absolute energy use3 by 26,563 MWh vs. 2019.
We consider 2020 environmental performance as an anomaly as reduced energy use and emissions can be attributed to factors out of our control.
As operations begin to normalize, the pandemic response may affect our emissions in three ways: • increased emissions, for example through increased airflow management and HVAC requirements, in order to help keep our employees healthy through the pandemic; • delayed return to full building occupancy; and • continued flexible work-from-home capabilities.
• Experienced lower travel-related emissions, as the pandemic vastly reduced all business travel throughout most of the year. There was a 79.5% decrease in GHG emissions from corporate travel in 2020 vs. 2019. We plan to report on mileage claimed for travel in low-emission (hybrid or electric) vehicles once business travel resumes. Although some business travel will resume, the pandemic pushed us to find more ways to replace travel with virtual alternatives. We have increased our investments in virtual collaboration tools as they have been proven an effective way to work with colleagues around the globe.
• Decreased emissions per full-time employee (FTE) by 5% from 2017-2019, despite a growing workforce. In 2020, emissions per FTE decreased by 35% largely due to pandemic-related lower building occupancy.
TRUSTED AND RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS / Climate change and the environment. 
REDUCING WASTE • Expanded our centralized waste diversion program to all major and regional offices in North America. Instead of using desk-side recycling bins, a centralized recycling station was set up on each floor. We ran a pilot program at one of our Toronto offices, before starting work from home measures as a result of the pandemic. The pilot increased waste diversion by 15%.
IMPROVING CLIMATE RESILIENCE • Built a sustainability assessment process into all aspects of our corporate real estate operations in North America. We now incorporate sustainability considerations in every step of a building’s lifecycle. In 2021, 3 Normalized value.

Improving the climate resiliency of our buildings. 
CASE STUDY. 
In 2019, we conducted a property risk study at 16 of our corporate offices in North America. We identified a number of risks, with the highest-rated from weather-related impacts. In 2020, we worked on updating and/or closing these risks. Below are a few of the initiatives we completed over the year: 1. Developed climate resiliency assessment processes across our North American corporate real estate portfolio.
2. Set up a risk dashboard for each building. The dashboard will track and continuously evaluate risks.
SUSTAINABILITY CONSIDERED THROUGHOUT BUILDING LIFECYCLE. 
Space design. 
Leasing or new construction. 
Decomissioning 3. Created a risk management plan for all North American major sites. We’ll look to extend this process to our international offices starting in 2021.
We also incorporate WELL9, LEED®10 and BOMA BEST11 requirements in new construction cases.
The work we’ve done is improving our preparedness and business continuity planning, along with employee safety of our buildings. We’ll continue to address the physical risks of climate change to our properties. At the same time, we’ll research new and innovative ways to adapt our buildings.
Improve education, awarenessraising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning.

TRUSTED AND RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS / Risk management. 
As a large insurer and asset manager, Sun Life faces a variety of risks and uncertainties. These risks range from interest rate fluctuations and cybersecurity, to emerging ones such as climate change. Identifying and mitigating these risks is critical to our competitiveness, long-term sustainability and ability to meet financial obligations to Clients.
Risk Management. 
Our Approach. 
Our Risk Management Framework (RMF) is a comprehensive set of protocols and programs for conducting our business activities. The RMF spans all areas and geographies of our organization and includes:
One of the ways we assess risk and the effectiveness of our internal controls is through scenario testing. Scenario testing involves making changes to a number of risk factors to assess the impact of an interaction between these risk factors. These scenarios include stress testing and reverse stress testing. These exercises analyze Sun Life’s resiliency under extreme scenarios and consider the impact of a severe economic shock, a health pandemic, a cyber breach, extreme weather events, and more. Our business continuity plans consider various scenarios under which a disruption may occur. Every year, we update our business continuity plans to better integrate evolving risks and the findings of our scenario analysis.
MANAGING ESG RISKS Many stakeholders are increasingly interested in our exposure to environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related risks and the ways we’re addressing them. Demand for climaterelated disclosure, in particular, is increasing.
Climate risk mitigation and management is a priority amid the increasing threat of climaterelated impacts. We continue working to better understand and address potential climate-related risks stemming from: • Physical risk: risks related to physical impacts of climate change, including extreme weather events; and. 
Everyone at Sun Life is responsible for identifying and managing risks when making business decisions. Our mandatory training program ensures employees are “risk ready". We educate them on how to spot, minimize and report risks that could affect our business. This training covers topics such as: • code of conduct, • emergency preparedness, • health and safety, • business continuity, • financial crime awareness, and • data protection.
Risk-related training. 
Risk culture relates to how we behave and respond as an organization. We need to ensure we consider risk in everything we do. We have a Risk Culture Statement supported by key principles. They include tone from the top, transparency, effective challenge and communication, incentives and accountability. These principles are designed to embed a strong, unified risk culture throughout Sun Life. We encourage discussions on risk decisions and urge employees to speak up about potential concerns.
Our risk culture. 
Our comprehensive suite of risk management policies and operating guidelines promote a consistent approach to managing risk exposure across Sun Life. Our Risk Appetite Policy is one example. It outlines specific constraints that define the total level of risk that Sun Life is willing to accept.
Risk management policies. 
Our three lines of defence model outlines specific duties related to risks, oversight and reporting.

• Transition risk: risks related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy, which includes policy, legal, technology and market changes to address the need to reduce and adapt to climate change.
We highlight some of our work in these areas in the Climate Change and the Environment section.
Sun Life supports the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD recommendations provide a framework for consistent, effective climate-related financial disclosures across industries. We’re applying its recommendations to enhance our climaterelated reporting (refer to 2020 Highlights on the right) and assess risks and opportunities.
We discuss other ESG-related risks in various sections of this report.
TRUSTED AND RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS / Risk management 2020 Highlights • Continued to receive strong financial strength ratings1 from AM Best, DBRS, Moody’s and S&P. The drivers of our ratings include: • the strength of our franchise, • our strong and stable operating performance, • a history of demonstrating robust capital and liquidity management, and • our comprehensive and well-developed risk management framework that encompasses our diverse business, our operations in multiple jurisdictions and our investment risk.
Our goal is to better understand the potential risks to the financial system of moving to a lower-carbon economy.
• Put our ‘pandemic playbook’ into action, to ensure we maintain key business functions and services through the COVID-19 crisis. Led by our Global Crisis Management Team, our actions included: • activating local crisis management teams to identify and respond to local critical needs; • restricting business travel; • communicating openly with employees, advisors and Clients; • implementing work-from-home requirements and tools; and • preparing responses to the rapidly shifting environment.
• Ran a risk awareness campaign during Fraud Prevention Month. The campaign highlighted the growing problem of benefits fraud and how to recognize it.
2020 GOALS RESULTS • Continue to work towards implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures • Continue to profile sustainability risks within our long-term strategic plan • Continue to raise sustainability-related risks with executive management committees and forums. 
Achieved. 
Achieved – climate change considered in the Strategic Plan – Risk Profile Achieved – Executive Risk Committee and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors received √
√ √ quarterly reports on emerging and top risks including climate change. Sustainability Policy approved by the Governance, Investment & Conduct Review Committee.
2021 GOALS • Conduct additional climate change scenario analysis and stress tests with a focus on transition risk • Continue implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures • Continue to profile sustainability risks and opportunities within our long-term strategic plan • Continue to raise sustainability-related risks within executive management committees and forums • Continued to treat climate change as a top and emerging risk. Our risk teams and business leaders monitor potential impacts of climate change and related risks on our business and investments. We also engaged our executive team in deeper discussion of climate change management.
• Included our first TCFD-aligned disclosures in Sun Life’s 2020 Annual Report. We’ve been communicating climate-related risks in our disclosures for several years. But these new disclosures in our Annual Report mark further progress on our journey to fully implementing the recommended disclosures. The disclosures help investors and other stakeholders to assess our management of potential climate-related impacts on our business.
• Actively participating in a climate scenario analysis pilot program between the Bank of Canada and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (our regulator in Canada).

TRUSTED AND RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS / Data security and privacy. 
Our Approach. 
DATA SECURITY Cybersecurity is a top priority for Sun Life. We continue to evolve our cyber defences, as outlined on our security webpage. We’re ensuring these defences are effective against the different threats that are emerging. We do this through: • Employee training: Our global security awareness program teaches all employees about their security responsibilities and how to protect our Clients’ data. The program includes required security training, phishing simulation tests, and regular communications. We also offer resources to help employees deliver on their responsibilities.
• Defence-in-depth strategy: We follow the three lines of defence model to manage security risks (refer to Risk Management). We incorporate a “defence-in-depth” strategy and use multiple control layers to protect all data. These include denial-of-service mitigation, web firewalls, intrusion monitoring, endpoint detection and response technology, antimalware software, and encryption. We also align our security program to leading frameworks such as the Cybersecurity Framework of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. This framework outlines best practices to help organizations manage and lower their cybersecurity risks.
• Security audits and testing: We regularly perform security audits, scanning and testing of Sun Life’s systems and practices involving Client data. Sun Life has established a team that conducts security missions to evaluate how effective our controls are and to drive operational improvements. We use security solutions that incorporate artificial intelligence and machine learning. These technologies help our security analysts to assess threats and respond to cyberattacks.
• Security intelligence: We use several cyber intelligence services to help us identify, assess and update our defences against the latest cyber threats. Sun Life also participates in industry committees to share intelligence and best practices for guarding against cyberattacks. Committees include: the Cyber Security Specialists Group organized by the Canadian Bankers Association, the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association Information Security Sharing Group, and the Canadian Cyber Threat Exchange.
On a quarterly basis, we report on cyber risk and cybersecurity to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors (the Board).
PRIVACY Our global privacy program is part of Sun Life’s enterprise-wide risk management framework and includes various standards and processes. Our Global Privacy Commitment explains how we protect Clients’ personal information in our care.
We use privacy by design in our product development. For new or changed initiatives, we conduct Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs), which help us identify and manage risks. We also include privacy and security clauses in contracts with third parties that handle Client data.
We engage with external organizations such as the Canadian Anonymization Network (CANON) to develop best practices for building effective privacy programs. CANON promotes anonymization as a privacy-respectful way of using data for economic and socially-beneficial purposes.
All employees get annual privacy training as well as guidance through our privacy policies. This support helps them fulfill our corporate privacy commitments and understand relevant regulations.
Privacy Officers across the enterprise help our businesses make privacy-related decisions. On a quarterly basis, we report significant privacy matters to the Board.
In the digital age, organizations like Sun Life hold more personal information than ever before. Our Clients trust us with their information. It’s critical that we take a leadership role to manage Client data safely and responsibly. Across our businesses, we use data to be more personal, predictive and proactive to help Clients reach their goals.

2020 Highlights. 
BUILDING OUR CYBER DEFENCES • Conducted more than 523,000 phishing simulation tests across our global workforces. We established additional learning activities for employees who failed the tests. For example, we launched an online training program available in English, French, Bahasa and Vietnamese.
• Upgraded to a new intrusion detection system. The new tool uses behavioural patterns to detect novel attacks and insider threats at an early stage. This security capability increases the accuracy of detections and reduces false positives.
• Implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Clients on the sunlife.ca website. MFA strengthens the process for verifying Clients when they log in to our website.
• Promoted annual Cybersecurity Awareness Month to employees globally. We held virtual information sessions on topics including cloud security, application security, protecting the remote workforce against cyber threats, and security challenges in the wake of COVID-19.
ENHANCING PRIVACY GOVERNANCE • Took significant steps to embed our new Client Data Privacy Principles into our policies and guidelines. We also launched a communication and awareness campaign to help everyone at Sun Life live and breathe these principles.
• Enhanced the way we conduct PIAs for new business initiatives, including providing guidance around ethical considerations. Conducting a PIA is a strong risk management practice for identifying and mitigating privacy risks. This process generates a wealth of insights for reporting and analysis and will help us target areas for improvement.
• Engaged with Canadian governments at all levels to discuss data privacy issues. We discussed topics like open banking, innovations in health care, and digitization. We also provided our views on amendments to the federal privacy framework. We wanted to ensure that it reflected the importance of protecting the privacy of our Clients as well as all Canadians in the new data-driven economy. In addition, we actively engaged with provincial governments on proposed changes to privacy protection in their jurisdictions.
• Experienced one substantiated privacy complaint from a regulatory body in 2020. The regulator acknowledged the steps taken to resolve the complaint satisfactorily.
Sun Life’s robust and advanced cybersecurity solutions ensured a stable and secure network for our Clients and employees. We used intelligence sources, automation, and web filtering to strengthen our response to high-risk COVID-19 themed phishing campaigns.
The malicious campaigns became a particular concern as many Sun Life employees shifted to working remotely. Working from home presented additional cyber security challenges for our Company, as it increased our “attack surface”. For example, while video conference technology helped many Sun Life employees transition to remote work, the platform’s popularity made it a target and exposed a number of security issues. Our information security and technology teams worked to address the issues identified.
Protecting against COVID-related data attacks. 
The COVID-19 crisis not only spawned major health and economic impacts — it also fostered a new digital danger: malicious online attacks.
CASE STUDY. 
Capitalizing on uncertainty caused by the pandemic, COVID-19 related email phishing campaigns surged significantly from February to May 2020. Hackers and cybercrooks impersonated legitimate organizations and people to solicit donations, tricked users into downloading malware and more.
TRUSTED AND RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS / Data security and privacy 2020 GOALS RESULTS • Use cybersecurity analytics to improve monitoring, investigation, reporting and response capabilities • Continue to improve practices throughout Sun Life to embed ethical considerations in the development of innovative new digital capabilities • Begin global rollout of Sun Life’s new Client Data Privacy Principles introduced in 2019 • Work with the federal and provincial governments in Canada on public policy related to data privacy, portability and innovation. 
Achieved Achieved. 
Achieved Achieved √ √ √

TRUSTED AND RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS / Governance and ethics. 
Our Approach. 
Sun Life has built its business on ethics and integrity. We set strict guidelines and rules to direct the way we work. We follow them, wherever we do business.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE We’re committed to best-in-class practices in corporate governance. We balance the interests of Company management, the Board of Directors (the Board), shareholders, Clients and other stakeholders. Our approach starts at the top with our Board. Ten of our eleven Board members, including the Chair of the Board, are independent. This helps to ensure that we address the long-term interests of our stakeholders. The Board strives for continuous improvement and regularly reviews its governance practices. This practice is to ensure that Sun Life stays on top of changing regulatory and market expectations.
Our Board Diversity Policy considers multiple aspects of diversity, including gender, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and geography. The Board has committed to having a minimum representation of at least 30% female directors, with an aim towards balanced gender representation.
To learn more about our diversity efforts, refer to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.
The Board also oversees our sustainability agenda – refer to Sustainability Governance.
STRONG CULTURE Acting ethically is the foundation of a healthy business culture. We expect everyone representing Sun Life1 to behave responsibly. And we expect them to take accountability for their actions and comply with applicable laws wherever we operate. It’s not just about following rules and policies. It’s about doing the right thing and empowering our people to model an ethical culture.
Our Code of Conduct (the Code) sets out clear standards for proper behaviour. We have a robust framework of controls, policies and programs to support the Code and to help prevent and detect all forms of corruption. This protects our business and our Clients, and helps us meet legal and regulatory requirements.
We review the Code annually, with an indepth review at least every three years. These reviews help us stay relevant with emerging topics and the current environment, and reflect evolving industry standards. All employees and Board members must complete annual training and a declaration of compliance with the Code.
We’re committed to complying with the letter and the spirit of anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in the countries where we operate. It’s our policy to never engage in any form of bribery or corruption and to report potential violations immediately.
Our Code promotes speaking up and it outlines our commitment against retaliation. Employees and Board members are required to report all known and suspected Code breaches. Our Ethics Hotline empowers our employees to play an active role in protecting the organization. Employees can seek guidance and report misconduct anonymously. Our enterprise compliance team monitors and investigates reports to the Ethics Hotline.
Good governance and behaviour are essential for any sustainable business. This is especially important for financial services companies like ours, which depend on public trust.
Governance and Ethics 1 All employees, all Directors of Sun Life and their subsidiaries and controlled joint venture companies, and third parties acting on our behalf or representing us.

TRUSTED AND RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS / Governance and ethics. 
RESPONSIBLE SALES AND MARKETING The fair treatment of Clients is an integral part of our ethical culture. We, and our third-party representatives, are committed to keeping Clients top of mind. That’s true for all aspects of our business operations and activities, including designing, marketing, selling and delivering our products and services. Our compensation, commission and incentive structures help encourage good sales practices. Our advertising and sales materials, including prospectuses and point of sale materials, are accurate, clear and offer full disclosure. We all have a responsibility to consider our Clients’ interests at all stages of the product life cycle. We’re committed to offering products and services that provide fair value.
ADVOCACY AND PUBLIC POLICY We engage with governments and regulators in public policy discussions to share our views and those of our Clients, employees and communities on issues relevant to our business.
We do this both directly and through our participation in industry associations, including the: • Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association, • American Council of Life Insurers, and • Hong Kong Federation of Insurers. You’ll find 2020 highlights of our public policy activities throughout this report.
Wherever we operate, we comply with local lobbying laws and regulations. We’re committed to being transparent about our public policy positions and activities. Our Compliance Risk Management Framework and Prevention of Bribery and Corruption Operating Guidelines, supported by our Code, set out clear rules and restrictions for engaging with politicians and government officials.
• Achieved our gender representation goals for Board membership, with 36% women directors and 64% men directors. Also, three of our four Board committee chairs (75%) are women.
• Participated in Ontario’s Capital Markets Modernization Taskforce. Melissa Kennedy, Executive VicePresident, Chief Legal Officer & Public Affairs, was one of five members who comprised the Taskforce. Its 70+ recommendations range from requiring board and executive management diversity targets and TCFD-aligned climate disclosures from public companies, to changing the Ontario Securities Commission’s mandate and structure. Refer to the Final Report released in January 2021 for details.
2020 Highlights • Held regular education sessions in conjunction with Board and Committee meetings. These sessions give directors a deeper understanding of our business and operating environment, and encourage more in-depth discussion in specific areas. Refer to the 2021 Management Information Circular for a full list of education sessions completed in 2020.
• Held our 2020 Annual General Meeting virtually in light of the pandemic. This change made the meeting more accessible to shareholders and policyholders globally. They gave us positive feedback on having a greater opportunity to participate. There were more than three times the number of participants in 2020 compared to 2019.
• Proactively engaged with governments at all levels to assist in addressing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the early days of the lockdown, for instance, our Government and Regulatory Affairs team informed public officials about the impacts our company was seeing on healthcare services and the economy. We also provided suggestions on plans for a longer-term economic recovery, such as the opportunity for investment in sustainable infrastructure.
• Improved and streamlined our Code content for easier reading and comprehension. We also made the corresponding updates to our annual employee training on the Code to ensure our people understand their obligations.

APPENDICES / Stakeholder engagement and materiality. 
Stakeholder Engagement and Materiality. 
Our key stakeholders are: Clients, employees/ advisors, governments and regulators, industry associations, shareholders, investors, analysts, suppliers, and community organizations and members.
We regularly engage with our stakeholders in a variety of ways. Refer to our GRI Index.
Our sustainability reporting covers the ESG topics that matter most to our stakeholders. We review and evaluate these topics through a process that includes assessing our stakeholders’ needs. This process ensures we’re acting and reporting on the right topics. Under the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards for sustainability reporting, this overall process is called a materiality assessment. We conducted our latest materiality assessment in 2019. An independent third party managed the process, which involved three stages: topic identification, prioritization and validation.
As a result of this analysis, we identified a list of 24 ESG topics relevant to Sun Life. 12 of those topics are our most material. The matrix on the right shows the findings. In this report, we grouped some topics into broader themes, as certain topics are similar or interrelated. We plan to reassess this list again in 2021.

APPENDICES / ESG performance tables 1 Some corporate real estate offices are located in Real Estate Investment properties. Energy/water/emissions are counted under only one of the Real Estate Investment or Corporate Real Estate portfolios total emissions to avoid double-counting.
2 Utilities billed directly to Sun Life by the utility vendor, or submetered by the landlord and paid for by Sun Life based on actual consumption.
3 Scope 3 emissions related to utilities for Corporate Real Estate where utility bills are paid by the landlord are prorated for Sun Life's share of the building’s total gross leasable area and Real Estate Investment properties only include consumption where there is submetering. Scope 3 emissions from utilities that are directly billed to third party is excluded from reporting as it is considered outside of Sun Life's financial control.
4 Market-based electricity emissions reflect contractual instruments implemented with respect to electricity purchases, i.e. renewable energy credits (RECs).
5 Emissions resulting from waste are reported for Real Estate Investment properties, where available. Emissions from waste used to produce energy at Waste to Energy facilities are not considered to be in scope.
Sun Life obtained external and independent limited assurance of its Scope 1, 2 and selected Scope 3 data for its 2020 GHG emissions, and target performance methodology. Refer to the Assurance Statement and GHG Emissions Reporting Methodology for more information. Refer to additional notes on page 56.

APPENDIX III 6 The portion of emissions associated with landlord paid utilities for Corporate Real Estate and sub metered tenant paid electricity for Real Estate Investments (sources included in the assurance process) is reported as Scope 3. In 2020, the location-based emissions related to these sources was 7,292 tCO2e and market-based emissions related to these sources was 6,782 tCO2e.
7 Net emissions account for carbon offsets purchased to compensate for property emissions.
8 Location-based electricity emissions reflect the grid-average emission intensity (gCO2e/kWh) for the region in which a property is located.
9 Sun Life determines consumption based on utility bills or meter readings from third party providers. Where data is incomplete, Sun Life uses linear regression of historical consumption compared with weather data or uses a portfolio average consumption intensity to estimate consumption. The proportion of estimated location-based emissions in 2020 for the combined Corporate Real Estate and Real Estate Investments portfolio is approximately as follows: Scope 1 emissions is 20%, Scope 2 emissions is 13% and Scope 3 emissions (related to landlord-paid utilities where Sun Life is the tenant or submetered tenant-paid utilities where Sun Life is the landlord (excluding waste and water) is 34%.
