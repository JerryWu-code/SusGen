 22 4 Risk Assessment for Future Projects 4.1 Introduction. 
APSEZ has established an Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) for its business activities to increase compliance, enhancement of corporate governance, reduce environmental, occupational and community health, safety risks.
ESMS is a set of processes and practices to consistently implement APSEZ policies to meet organizations business objectives. The goal is to make sure that we have the appropriate policies and procedures in place and that people at various levels of the organization consistently follow them. The ESMS helps to assess and control risks and is the key to lasting improvement.

The ESMS will apply to all activities of APSEZ which includes:  Development of Ports. Terminals, SEZ Infrastructure and associated services;  Acquisition of Ports, Terminals, SEZ Infrastructure during various phases; and  Management of Ports, Terminals, SEZ and associated services.
Collectively, the ESMS Manual and its supporting documents constitute a flexible management approach that is based directly on IFC Performance Standard’s, Safeguard Requirements of ADB SPS, and can readily accommodate the changing needs of the Ongoing/ Futuristic Projects and/or Acquisitions of APSEZ.
In addition to the requirements of IFC PS, ESMS contents also consider applicable elements of the following;  ADB Safeguard Policy Statement, June 2009;  The Equator Principles, July 2020;  The ISO 45001:2018 – Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Management System Standard;  The ISO 14001:2015 – Environmental Management System (EMS) Standard; and  The World Bank Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines for Ports, Harbors and Terminals.

ESMS will help APSEZ in timely identification of prevention, and management of any foreseeable Environmental Risks and Impacts due to any of its business activities.

APSEZ ESMS Framework. 
ESMS covers the lifecycle of any project or activity starting from the project planning to operations. To assess the environmental and social issue during any phase of the life cycles 14 framework documents have been developed which guides the Company as per the IFC Performance standards. At project planning stage of any green or brown field project two frameworks must be followed mandatorily which are Site Screening & Categorization and Environmental and Social Impact Assessment. During all the three stage of project right from project planning of green field or brown field projects to infrastructure development to the operation, 8 applicable frameworks are followed which are pertaining to Land Acquisition, Resettlement & Community Development, Environmental & Social Due Diligence, Land and Biodiversity Management, Contractor/ Subcontractor Management, Emergency Preparedness Plan, Disaster Management plan, Project Monitoring & Reporting and Cultural Heritage & Chance Find. During infrastructure development and operation two frameworks are followed Quarry and Security Management. While operation two other frameworks are followed which are Traffic and Operations Managements. The relevant frameworks are followed and become instrumental at different phases of the project.
4.2 Procedure for Risk Assessment. 
Importance/ Directive 1: Integrated assessment to identify the environmental and social impacts, risks, and opportunities of projects,
Framework for Environment and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) (ESM/FRAM/04)
Objective:  To assess the proposed project to determine whether or not the proposed project and associated activities will have any adverse impacts on the


 24 environment, taking into account environmental, social, cultural, economic, and legal considerations;  To evaluate alternatives; and  To design appropriate mitigation, management, and monitoring measures.
The scope and depth of the ESIA shall be decided based on the nature, complexity, and significance of the identified issues, as established into ‘Framework for Site Screening and Categorization - ESM/FRAM/01. Framework also provides: Site Screening Checklist for Greenfield Project - ESM/FORM/01 and Site Screening Checklist for Brownfield Project - ESM/FORM/02.
In situations where multiple projects occur in, or are planned for, the same geographic area APSEZ will conduct a Cumulative Impact Assessment (CIA) as part of the risks and impacts identification process. CIA shall;  “be commensurate with the incremental contribution, source, extent, and severity of the cumulative impacts anticipated”;  “determine if the project is incrementally responsible for adversely affecting an ecosystem component.
 or specific characteristic beyond an acceptable predetermined threshold (carrying capacity) by the relevant government entity, in consultation with other relevant stakeholders.”
Importance/ Directive 2: effective community engagement through disclosure of project-related information and consultation with local communities on matters that directly affect them; and. 
Framework for Land Acquisition, Resettlement, and Community Development (ESM/FRAM/02)  To assess suitability of land for proposed (greenfield) project/ site or extension of existing project/ site with minimal or no concerns of physical displacement (relocation or loss of shelter),  To avoid, and when avoidance is not possible, minimize displacement by exploring alternative project designs,  To assess and document, impacts (if any) on land and Project Affected People’s (PAPs) due to APSEZ project/ site activities.
 To describe requirements for disclosure of information, and consultations with project affected persons (PAPs), practicing a grievance mechanism, and resettlement monitoring and reporting.

 25 4.3 Case study: Divestment of Bowen Rail Company Pty Limited (BRCPL) by APSEZ. 
BRCPL was incorporated on 16 December 2019 (in the FY 2019-20) with the parent entity being Bowen Rail Operation Pte. Ltd in Singapore. The principle activity of this entity is providing rail logistics services in Australia. As part of the annual ESG performance review by the Management for the FY 2019-20 (under the aegis of Board’s Sustainability & CSR Committee) it was decided that APSEZ will divest its investments from BRCPL.
Accordingly, all contractual documentation and the regulatory approval processes were initiated for the said divestment. APSEZ during January 2021 formally communicated to its investors and rating agencies regarding the divestment. S&P also included this in its Press release (issued for January 2021 USD bond issuance) that APSEZ will be divesting from BRCPL.
APSEZ has on 25 March 2021 executed the Share Purchase Agreement with Adani Global Pte Limited (Subsidiary of Adani Enterprises Limited) for sale of investment in BRCPL. The transaction is awaited for the regulatory approval by Foreign Investment Review Board of Australia. In the interim, APSEZ will reflect the investment as held for sale in its books of accounts.
4.4 Case study: Myanmar project by APSEZ. 
In order to expand the container terminal network in ASEAN region, in July 2017 Adani International Terminal Pte Ltd (AITPL) was established in Singapore as a foreign subsidiary of APSEZ.
Chronology of events for the investment in Myanmar:
July 2017 Establishment of AITPL, Singapore as the regional hub for South East Asia. 
February 2019 Incorporation of Adani Yangon International Terminal Company Limited (AYITCL), Myanmar as subsidiary of AITPL. 
April 2019 Application by AYITCL to Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) for approving investment of USD 290 million for construction of a greenfield container terminal at the port of Myanmar. MIC is a government-appointed body under the Ministry of Planning and Finance that appraises investment proposals in Myanmar. MIC approved the investment for the project and permit was granted for initial period of 50 years. MIC was run and administered by the Civilian Government at the time of issuing the approval.


 26. 
May 2019 Build Operate and Transfer (BOT) contract for 50 years was signed for setting of the container terminal The land acquisition for the development of the project facilitated by MIC and was allotted vide a Lease agreement with Myanmar Economic Corporation Limited (MEC) to use and develop the land free of encumbrances.
June 2019 –
December 2019. 
Payment of USD 90 million made to MEC of under the Lease Agreement for the land acquisition of the Project. 
March 2021 OFAC added MEC to the sanction list. 
Payments made under the Project:
Adani Group’s last such payment to MEC occurred in August 2020, nearly six full months prior to the imposition of the sanctions. APSEZ has paid in full all of the amounts owed to MEC of about USD 90 million under the Lease Agreement for the Myanmar port project. Since then there has been no transaction with MEC and there has been no more transaction that we have entered with either MEC or any other sanctioned entities.
We want to iterate that when we had entered into the above agreements none of the entities or individuals or entities controlled by individuals were under sanctioned list.
Current Project Status:
The company has currently invested USD 127 million (including USD 90 million for the upfront payment for land lease as mentioned above) out of a total of USD 230 million for Phase I of the Project. The project provides employment to about 300350 (direct and through sub-contract) at the site. The existing counterparties of AYITCL engaged for the construction of the terminal (Contractors, Equipment suppliers) are not sanctioned parties and are not owned/ controlled by the sanctioned parties.
Company Policy & Our next steps:  The Company has zero tolerance policy to ensure that there is no contravention of US and other sanctions.
 The Company is in discussion with our US based counsels to ensure that the Company is in compliance with the OFAC sanctions programs. The company is planning to proactively approach OFAC to make sure that it is not in violation of the sanctions due to the recent development.
 The Company is also in discussion with the Indian Embassy at Myanmar to ensure protection and safety of its employees. The company currently employs 60 persons (local staff and expats) on the Project and the Company will provide


 27 utmost priority for the safety and wellbeing of its employees under the current circumstances.
 In a scenario wherein Myanmar is classified as a sanctioned country under the OFAC, or if OFAC opines that we are in violation of the current sanctions the Company has plans to abandon the project and will write-down its investments in the Project in full. The write down will not materially affect the balance sheet as it is equivalent to about 1.3% of the total assets of APSEZ.
 


 28 5 Sustainability Journey. 
APSEZ’s Sustainability Journey started in the year 2014 with a thought of publishing first Sustainability Report. The dedicated team started working to make this thought actualize. There were number of challenges initially like understanding the reporting framework, creating a baseline, benchmark the operations as per the framework requirement, align the organization with the sustainability goals etc. To make this initiative instrumental, in 2015, Sustainability Charter was developed by contemplating APSEZ’s Sustainability governance and this was an official kick start of APSEZ’s sustainability journey. Since then, APSEZ never looked back and kept marching forward creating the milestones which any Indian Port Company has never achieved.

At APSEZ, the Sustainability Initiatives are driven by the dedicated Sustainability Department which is overseen at three different levels on the top of which the Board level Sustainability and CSR Committee gives the direction, at Corporate level Sustainability Leadership Committee drives the initiatives and at the site level Sustainability Steering Committee executes the initiatives.


 29. 
Some of the functions are overseen at Group level but at the same time the business can drive the sustainability with full autonomy. This creates a forum where cross business functions share their knowledge and create a benchmark in the Group.
APSEZ thrives on the intent of Nation Building. This intent is not just about building infrastructure but a resilient nation building effort and mark the India’s position on the Global map as a part of inclusive global economy. With the time, APSEZ is evolving from India’s Largest Private Port Operator to become India’s First Green port by achieving the goals of Carbon neutrality, Water Positivity, Zero Waste to Landfill and Biodiversity conservation.

Case Study 1 – Biodiversity Conservation & Management: Mangroves at Mundra. 
Aligned to Sustainable Development Goals. 
Objective. 
To protect and conserve mangrove cover & its associated ecosystem to strengthen the natural defence mechanism against climate change.
About Project. 
APSEZ prepared a Comprehensive and Integrated plan for preservation and conservation of mangroves and associated creeks in and around the Mundra port by engaging the services of National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM) which is the reputed institute of Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC).
Methodology. 

Outcome  No obstruction to any water stream (creeks / branches of creeks/ rivers)  Mangrove cover in and around APSEZ is continuously increasing.  Mundra has undergone substantial development during this period. Hence, it can be interpreted that infrastructure development has not left any adverse impacts on ecology.
 


 48. 
Case Study 2 – Coastal Protection & Biodiversity Enhancement: Bio Shield Project. 
Aligned to Sustainable Development Goals. 
Objective  To create/ strengthen natural wind breaks or shelter belts in the coastal areas in order to protect the adjoining habitations and agricultural fields from effect of strong winds and to develop a natural barrier against the impact of storm and tidal surge.
 To address the environmental issues like coastal area degradation, salinity ingress, sea- water intrusion on agricultural lands, anthropogenic pressures etc.
 To promote sustainable Livelihood for the local community. 
About Project. 
First ever Bio-shield project in Gujarat coast is implemented by Adani’s Hazira port and also now another project by Adani’s Dahej port.
Methodology  An area of 1 km in length and 180 meters in breadth, on the sea coast was identified  The first 50m, from seaward side for Mangrove plantation, protected by natural bamboo fencing, helps protect seacoast and boost fisheries/ biodiversity.
 The next 50m consists of Piludi plantation, an oil-seed plant that acts as a source of additional income for nearby communities.
 Further next 50m consists of Sharu and Unt Morad plantation, that supplies fodder for cattle rearing during dry seasons  Finally, 30m consist of fodder, fruit and medicinal plants, which apart from economical value, will help in blocking saline winds and enhance the green cover.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNHMDVbx850. 
Outcome  Improvement in air quality due to sequestration of CO2.  Mangrove will help in trapping the sediment and breeding grounds for marine biota like crab, fish and birds etc.
 Help the fisherman community by enhancing fishery resource in the near-shore waters  Enhance livelihood opportunities through plantation and regeneration activities, increased fodder availability for livestock owners by alternative resource creation.
 There will be increased availability of fuel wood and small timber through sustainable harvesting of other plants.
 Since this is a community-based approach, the community have a feeling of owning the programme and the concept will be sustainable in the long run.

Case Study 3 – Conservation of Biodiversity: Turtle Nesting near Dhamra Port. 
Aligned to Sustainable Development Goals. 
Sea turtles existed on Earth and traveled our seas for the last 100 million years are a fundamental link in marine ecosystems which help maintain the health of seagrass beds and coral reefs that benefit commercially valuable species such as shrimp, lobster, and tuna. The breeding season for Olive Ridley Sea turtle in Odisha extends from November to May during which mating, egg-laying and hatching take place.
Nesting Locations:
Devi Rookery: Devi rookery was discovered in 1981 located at the mouth of the river Devi, along the central Orissa coast. Following the discovery of this site, mass nesting there was reported only twice, and in recent years only large number of sporadic nesting occurs.
Rushikulya River mouth: The southern-most site along the Odisha coast, the Rushikulya rookery was discovered in 1994 and is approx. 5 km beach located immediately north of the Rushikulya river mouth from Purunabandha to Kantiagada village. Rushikulya situated in Chatrapur, Ganjam district of Odisha. Lakhs of endangered Olive Ridley turtles also flocked the Rushikulya river mouth for their annual mass nesting.

Gahirmatha: Gahirmatha Marine Wildlife Sanctuary is located at the mouth of the River Maipura between the Dharma River and Paradeep, on the eastern boundary of Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary along the northern Odisha coast. The total area of the sanctuary is 1435 km2 which includes 1408 km2 of water body and 27.0 km2 of land mass including reserve forests, mud flats and accreted sand bars. Core area of the sanctuary consists of 725.50 km2 and the buffer zone accounts for 709.50 km2. The entire sanctuary area comes within the revenue district of Kendrapara. The Gahirmatha beach supports the natal nesting beach and largest known nesting beach of Olive Ridley Sea Turtle in the world. South beach is the only nesting beach where the arribada (mass arrival) has been taking place since 2009.
Protection Status: Olive Ridley sea turtle has found place in Schedule - I of Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 (amended 1991). All the species of sea turtles in the coastal water of Odisha are listed as "vulnerable" as per IUCN Red Data Book. The sea turtles are protected under the 'Migratory Species Convention' and CITES (Convention of International Trade on Wildlife Flora and Fauna). India is a signatory nation to all these conventions. The 'Homing' characteristics of the Ridley sea turtles make them more prone to mass casualty.

In the year when nesting not happened at Gahirmatha, the nesting was observed in Rashikulya river mouth.

Dr. H R Bustard, an international expert on turtles and crocodiles and their population ecology, said it is perfectly natural for Olive Ridley turtles to miss mass nesting. "The word 'failure' for their 'non-appearance' is a misnomer. We do not know why nesting does not occur every year, but this is not cause for concern," said Bustard, who claimed to have conducted the first-ever census of the sea turtles in 1975-76 at Gahirmatha. Mr. Bustard said according to annual census figures over past 38 years, there has been no mass nesting at Gahirmatha in 1981-82, 1984-85, 1987-88, 1996-97, 1997-98 (two years in succession), 2001-2002, and 2007-08. "It indicates arribada did not occur every year," he said to drive his point home. Environmentalists also expressed concern due to several reasons like beach erosion, bright light from the missile test range at Wheelers' Island near Gahiramatha and illegal fishing. Mr. Bustard, however, said ridley population in Odisha is quite healthy. "Despite deaths due to netting of bycatch, the population is increasing." Dr.(Mrs.) Priyambada Mohanty Hejmadi, a renowned zoologist and a member of High Powered Committee, in a fitting rebuff to all those who annually raise concerns over Olive Ridley protection measures and hurl accusation against the State Govt. for not taking adequate steps during the nesting and hatching season, said the Ridley’s themselves have snubbed such people by turning out in large numbers. Every year Orissa bashing


 51 takes place on account of false alarms raised by some people who allege lack of conservation measures, she noted.
Dhamra Port and Stakeholder Alignments:  Chief Secretary of Odisha chairs a High Powered Committee annual review meeting that is attended by Principal Secretary Forest & Environment, Principal Chief Conservator of Forest, Chief wildlife Warden, Head Coast Guard Odisha Zone and Dhamra port attends the meeting and is part of the comprehensive high level strategy initiative for protection of the endangered Olive Ridley species.
 Awareness and conservation programs for local peoples  Offshore patrolling by different law enforcing agencies like coast guards of Indian navy, defense and custom department of central government and state govt. Regular survey to assess the number of nesting, dead turtles and to monitor the threats to the population.
 Illumination of light near the nesting beach has been stopped or reduced. Use of TED (Turtle excluder device) during fishing and trawling operation. Banning of fishing and trawler movement near shore during nesting season.
 Dhamra Port has submitted a proposal for establishing a “Olive Ridley Turtle &
Estuarine Crocodile Research Center” at Dhamra in joint partnership with Government of Odisha (GoO). GoO is actively examining the proposal.
Turtle Conservation Measures  The port area and its navigation channel are outside the Turtle Congregation area  Compliant to IUCN recommendations - Lighting & Dredging protocol  Specially designed “dark sky friendly” lights fixed in the port and township  Glare not transmitted towards sea & movement of turtle in their congregation area  Collaborate efforts with Govt. during mating, congregation, nesting & hatching  Providing trawler to the Forest Department for patrolling purpose  Demarcated Gahirmatha Marine Sanctuary by buoys in 2014  Committed to Create a corpus of INR 30 Crores.

Case Study 4 – Environment Pollution Control: Zero Waste to Landfill. 
Aligned to Sustainable Development Goals. 
Vision Zero Waste – Enabling Circular Economy. 
Inline to Clean India Mission of Government of India, APSEZ developed a vision of Zero Waste Company in 2014 by adopting 5R principles of Waste Management. APSEZ has developed SOPs for scientific handling and management of each type of waste and made significant progress though systematic inventorization, segregation, collection, treatment, storage & disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes.
It is our target to reduce waste generation and send zero waste to landfill through increased reuse, recycle, reprocess and recovery of waste. In FY19, 5718 MT of waste was disposed. In FY20 FY20, it was declined to 2610 MT and in FY21, it further reduced to 2042 MT. In FY20, we developed integrated approach for circular economy-based model of environment conservation with economic and social wellbeing.
While undertaking this exercise our approach was to achieve economic wellbeing by minimizing cost of waste management, waste to wealth and circular economy. While, simultaneously on the social dimension - a self-sustainable model with local vendor development and local employment was undertaken which resulted in livelihood support. To achieve this, a state-of-the-art waste management facility was developed. To make the initiative inclusive the facility takes waste from other industries and visiting ships for expanding the horizon of environmentally sound management of wastes. Currently this initiative has been implemented at Mundra that enabled us to achieve a Zero Waste to Landfill certificate for Mundra operations. This initiative will be implemented across APSEZ ports by 2025.

Case Study 5 – Resource Conservation: Use of treated wastewater at Hazira port. 
Aligned to Sustainable Development Goals. 
Activity. 
Stakeholder engagement and infrastructure development to consume treated effluent. 
Objective. 
To reduce freshwater footprint at Hazira Port in a cost-effective manner. 
About Project. 
KRIBHCO, a fertilizer company at Hazira, treats its effluent and discharges it into sea. We signed an MOU with KRIBHCO to provide a minimum of 2000KL per day of treated wastewater to meet our water requirements at Hazira Port. It is a symbiotic agreement between two parties which resulted into reduction of freshwater footprint in cost effective and environment friendly manner.
Methodology. 
Other options for meeting water requirement were to obtain freshwater through private parties. This option was easier to implement but would have been more detrimental to the environment. Whereas, the procedure of bringing all stakeholders on board for availing treated wastewater was more tedious.
KRIBHCO’s wastewater treatment plant is about 18km from our port location. To bring this treated wastewater to our facility, we have laid a pipeline of 18km from the treatment facility till port.
Outcome. 
We made a CAPEX investment of INR 1200lakhs but do not incur any major operational cost except for the cost of water paid to KRIBHCO. It helps us in receiving good quality water, at lower CAPEX and OPEX as compared to desalination and also reduce pressure on fresh water resources.

Case Study 6 – GHG Emission Reduction: Alternate Fuel. 
Aligned to Sustainable Development Goals. 
Activity. 
Converting Rubber Tyre Gantry Cranes (RTG) from Diesel mode to Electrical power. 
Objective. 
To reduce GHG emission by conversion of entire RTG fleet to electric power. 
About Project. 
In container handling ports, RTGs are used to handle the containers (movement and positioning) in yard locations. Traditionally, RTGs are equipped with DG Sets that transform diesel fuel into electrical energy for powering the motors of RTG. Through innovative retrofit measures, these conventional RTGs were converted into an ElectricRTG (e-RTG) by shutting down the DG Set and enabling powering through electricity (sourced from the grid). This modification resulted in a reduction in diesel fuel consumption in RTG operation by about 95%, as in e-RTG fuel is used only to transfer the RTG between blocks.
Methodology. 
DRTG to ERTG is a long-term energy efficiency plan of the Company. It was first implemented at Mundra port and continues to be implemented at all port locations. We internalize energy efficiency measures and bring them into the mainstream of our operations. The activity was conceptualized by Engineering Department. RTG was retrofitted with movable trolley with the existing current collector brush. It also has a busbar system which was installed with fixed structures at container yard and power supplied through compact substation to bus-bars. This makes it possible for the current collector trolley to automatically engage with bus-bar and get power supply which is required for operation. In FY20, this activity was taken up at Kattupalli port where 15 RTGs were retrofitted.
Financial Outcome. 
The retrofitting cost was INR 44 Crore at Kattupalli. It resulted in a saving of 1.5 litres of fuel per container. In FY21, for 7,80,322 container moves, a saving of 28,440 GJ was achieved, which avoided 879 tCO2e of direct emission and saved almost INR 7 Crore. This initiative contributed to reducing 17% of the total energy consumption.

Case Study 9 – Creating Sustainable Livelihood: Reviving the Ancient Namda Art. 
Aligned to Sustainable Development Goals. 
Namda Kala is one of such ancient art older than spinning and weaving, meaning woolen artefact is the art of making felted floor coverings and paddings, and then embroidering the pieces with hand-dyed threads. In existence since 1800s and was in demand due to use by royal families and then by government through bulk orders till early 2000s.
Then gradually fade away due to new art forms but handful of artisans held on to their family legacy of Namda Kala. This is the story of one such adept artisan.
Karim Umar Mansuri is the only Namda artisan in Kutch (Gujarat) – a place where families were traditionally involved in animal husbandry, owning large herds of livestock. Thus, the art of crafting using sheep wool was handed down form fathers to sons. However, in a quickly changing and modernizing world, Karim was struggling to survive in a dwindling market and was forced to start looking for menial jobs.

In 2017, Adani Foundation – the CSR arm of the Adani Group –reached out to Karim and decided to help sustain Namda. Later that year, the Adani Group placed an order of 750 Namda camels, worth INR 55.5 lakhs by bringing 30-35 artisans onboard. Also provided good infrastructure to work and train people as well as help developed linkages with professors and students from renowned design schools like NID and NIFT.

Through Adani Foundation’s relentless drive and Karim’s passion, the story of Namda Kala has achieved international recognition. A closely guarded family secret of Namda, which was about to disappear due to lack of opportunities, is now a source of sustainable livelihood. Sustainable development of any community entails furthering its traditional arts and crafts, offering sustainable livelihood interventions that accord dignity of life and living to artisans as well as longevity to the art.
