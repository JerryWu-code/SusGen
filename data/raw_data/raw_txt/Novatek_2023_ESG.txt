NOVATEK has adapted quickly, maintained its strategic priorities and stayed focused on what matters most — delivering affordable, reliable, and cleaner-burning energy that supports the society’s goals of sustainable development.
Leonid Mikhelson Chairman of NOVATEK’s Management Board. 
Letter from the Chairman of NOVATEK’s Management Board. 
Our multi-facet approach underlies our sixteenth Sustainability Report, entitled Focusing on What Really Matters. We remain strongly committed to universal values, contributing to the achievement of both the national goals of the Russian Federation and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
As we increase our natural gas and LNG supplies with one of the lowest carbon footprints in the world, we unlock even more opportunities for our valued customers to decarbonize their industrial base by transitioning away from carbon-intensive fuels. In 2022, our natural gas production reached 82 bcm with its respective share in the Company’s total hydrocarbon output increasing to 84%. Our flagship large-scale Yamal LNG project operated steadily above its design capacity, while the significant progress achieved in the construction of our second, large-scale Arctic LNG 2 project during the reporting year brings us closer to the expected launch in 2023 as scheduled.
The steady growth of our business enables us to focus on the needs of our key stakeholders and to reinvest in further expansion of production, and invest in our decarbonization initiatives. In 2022, our total investments in various sustainability areas exceeded RR 12 billion. We maintained favorable working conditions for our employees by indexing their salary three times throughout the year and increasing our social support for employees by 15% to offset mounting inflation. We also contributed to the development of our local communities by increasing social spending by 3%. Despite external constraints and supply chain disruptions, we significantly increased our investments in research and development as well as in renewable energy sources.
2022 was marked by unprecedented challenges and changes that dramatically altered the usual operating environment. External constraints, rising inflation, governmental interventions, and supply chain disruptions — all required us to be agile in our decision-making and flexible in our approaches.
At NOVATEK, our strategy is to leverage our strengths by securely and safely delivering lower carbon energy to an increasingly growing world.
In 2022, we made significant progress in achieving our climate goals. Apart from improving our GHG emissions intensity, we have also reduced absolute GHG emissions — all of this achieved despite rising hydrocarbon production.
The Company was successful in reducing direct GHG emissions by 6% through a range of measures, including boosting associated petroleum gas utilization and energy efficiency. To reduce indirect energy GHG emissions, we are gradually phasing in renewable energy sources across our operations. For instance, in 2022, our Cryogas-Vysotsk LNG plant transitioned to renewable sources of energy, and in the future we plan to transit the Ust-Luga Complex to renewable energy sources.

Our LNG supplies helped our customers reduce carbon emissions by approximately 21 million tons of CO2 equivalent in 2022 due to the substitution of coal. Also in the reporting year, we developed our own accounting methodology based on international standards to report greenhouse gas emissions of LNG shipments by Yamal LNG, which enables our customers to better manage their carbon footprints and plan decarbonization initiatives.
Our competitive edge is maintained by leveraging the latest technologies and breakthroughs, relying on Russian innovations through our direct involvement and investments. In 2022, we launched the development of a domestic low-carbon ammonia production technology. We inaugurated a Laboratory and Research Center in Tyumen to further boost our R&D capabilities.
As part of our Comprehensive Environmental and Climate Change Targets Program, we significantly reduced specific emissions of pollutants and specific water withdrawal in 2022 and cut landfilled waste by almost half. We also delivered on a range of initiatives to support biodiversity in close cooperation with the relevant research community and consistent with advanced international norms and standards.
We focus on protecting the health and safety of our people as one of our key operational priorities. Our lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR), the standout success of last year, was reduced by a significant 25% year-on-year, driven by our improved occupational health management performance.
We invested significant efforts to remain an attractive employer and offer decent working conditions for our employees, even amidst the current crisis. We increased our social support and raised the average salary to maintain a high quality of life for our people. Our employee turnover decreased to 7%, even with over 2 thousand new people joining our team and our headcount exceeding 19 thousand people over the reporting year.
Protecting the rights of the indigenous peoples of the Far North has always been one of the fundamental goals at NOVATEK. This goal is achieved through targeted initiatives to preserve their ancestral lands, traditional ways of life, culture, and ethnic identity. The four-year community monitoring program completed at Yamal LNG in 2022 verified that nomadic communities continue to engage in reindeer herding, fishing, hunting, and gathering.
Leonid Mikhelson Chairman of NOVATEK’s Management Board. 
We remain highly confident that our commitment to responsible business principles and practices, combined with our keen focus on delivering on our strategic goals and objectives will further drive success in our business and significantly contribute to a sustainable future — focusing on what really matters.
The robust corporate governance system that we have built over the years, the quality and dedication of our professional team, and our strong commitment to our shared values will drive further profitable and sustainable growth for the Company.
Letter from the Chairman of NOVATEK’s Board of Directors. 
The Board of Directors were called upon to meet unprecedented challenges throughout 2022 and, accordingly, paid particular attention to mitigating risk measures to ensure that the Company delivers on its corporate strategy. The Board’s Audit Committee reviewed an updated risk map that included new risks associated with external constraints to increase our financial and operational flexibility and ensure the new risks are adequately addressed.
In 2022, the Board of Directors and its committees focused on the most critical strategic matters, including delivering on prospective projects, developing our resource base, and other various aspects related to sustainability and corporate governance.
The Board focused on the quality and adequacy of sustainability disclosures by directly engaging in robust discussions on determining the material topics for the Sustainability Report 2022. A new version of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics was also approved, while a new version of the Occupational Health, Industrial and Fire Safety, and Environmental Policy for the Group was reviewed and approved in early 2023.
Two workshops were conducted for Board members in 2022, based on themes on Sustainability in the New Normal and The Current Status of LNG Markets, involving leading industry experts and climate researchers. This was part of our work to implement the recommendations from an external independent performance evaluation of the Board of Directors. The training provided our Company directors and management with expert insights.
As one of the largest LNG exporters globally, NOVATEK contributes meaningfully to the global energy transition and helps our customers to smaller carbon footprint. For this reason, the Board of Directors considers it to be of the utmost importance that we continue following the best practices and guidance outlined in the United Nations Global Compact as well as the standards of the International Finance Corporation and other international standards.

8/9 PAO NOVATEK Sustainability Report 2022 Adapting to External Challenges in 2022 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08


In 2022, we revised our approach to determining material topics for disclosure in the Report. Drawing on our stakeholder engagement experience of past years, we pro-actively introduced new elements in line with the recommendations of GRI Standards 2021. In 2022, we introduced the double materiality principle and expanded the scope of impacts analyzed, which are the two principal changes in our procedure to determine material topics for the reporting year.
The process to determine content and assess materiality comprised four stages.
When determining the material topics to be disclosed in the Report, we considered two interrelated aspects.
The first aspect is how NOVATEK’s activities impact society, the environment, and economy.
Such impacts indirectly affect value creation through their perception by stakeholders, who are interested in how the Company contributes to sustainable development goals.
We regularly assess the impact of our operations in line with best Russian and international standards, e.g., through Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), Cumulative Impact Assessment, analysis of grievance and feedback mechanisms for a wide range of matters, and other processes. In addition to our routine procedures when preparing the Report, we surveyed external and internal stakeholders to understand the relevance of the determined topics for disclosure in this Report.
Determining Material Topics. 
Double materiality principle • Analysis of material topics from GRI 11: Oil and Gas Sector, SASB, and reports of oil and gas majors • Analysis of stakeholder requests and reports, evaluation criteria of sustainability ratings, and the results of Cumulative Impact Assessments of the Company’s projects. 
List of topics relevant to NOVATEK (24 topics in total)
List of topics rated by stakeholders on a 10-point scale. 
Determination of material and relevant topics (18 and 6, respectively) and their approval by the Board of Directors. 
Surveys of stakeholders (external and internal) to identify the Company’s impacts across each topic on the list prepared at the first stage. 
Quantitative assessment of impacts on the Company by comparing the topics determined at the first stage with risks from the Company Risk Map; Value at Risk also calculated. 
Generation of a materiality matrix, prioritization of topics based on the impact assessment, and separation of listed topics into material and relevant ones.

ASSESSING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACTS 3. 
PRIORITIZING AND APPROVING TOPICS 4. 
List of topics ranked by the value of the risk’s impacts on the Company’s business. 
The second aspect is related to risk management and sustainability opportunities.
Since our activities directly translate to financial and business results, this aspect is financial in nature and directly affects Company value creation, making it crucial for shareholders and investors.
NOVATEK regularly assesses the potential impacts of risks using its own multi-tier risk management and internal control system. In 2022, the Board of Directors reviewed the Risk Map to include sustainability risks and discussed the Company’s first. 
Opportunity Map. To prepare this Report, the Company conducted its first Value-at-Risk (VaR) analysis by comparing sustainability risks from the Risk Map with the topics determined through the stakeholder survey. This way, the topics were prioritized, and material ones were determined, which are subject to full disclosure in this Report.
In the reporting year, to enhance control over the process of determining material topics, the Company’s Board of Directors reviewed it for the first time and approved the final list for disclosure in the Report.

considering is the 5+ million tons per year Obskiy LNG. The Company also invests in advanced LNG technologies, equipment localization, and research and development (R&D). We are successfully building the Offshore Superfacility Construction Center (LNG Construction Center), the world’s first facility for mass production of natural gas liquefaction trains on gravitybased structures (GBS). To effectively ship LNG along the Northern Sea Route, NOVATEK plans to build two terminals in the Murmansk Region and in Kamchatka. The Company also reinvests in renewable energy and low-carbon projects. Under the project to build a wind farm on the Yamal Peninsula, a series of wind measurements was completed in 2022, and construction design options were reviewed. We resolved to contribute to developing Russian low-carbon ammonia production technology with carbon dioxide capture and long-term storage in geological structures.
Reinvestment. 
Contribution to sustainable development. 
The Company’s operating margins ensure prompt dividend payouts and shareholder returns. NOVATEK’s dividend policy is based on keeping the balance between the Company’s business goals and shareholder interests. Each dividend resolution, the amount of the dividend, the payment deadline, and form of the dividend are subject to approval at the General Meeting of Shareholders upon the recommendation of the Board of Directors.
We care not only about financial value, but also about the impact we make in the value creation process. Therefore we always dedicate part of our efforts and resources to identifying and managing impacts. We develop human capital, promote economic and social well-being across our regions of operation, and continuously invest in innovation. In 2022, we increased our investments in environmental protection, workplace safety, employee and local community care, renewables, and R&D, which topped RR 12 billion.

Strategy Review PAO NOVATEK Sustainability Report 2022


Supplier rights Local community rights. 
The Company makes every effort to reduce its negative impact and increase its positive contribution to regional development, especially since most of its production operations take place in indigenous lands of the North. We pay particular attention to respecting their rights to preserve traditional ways of life and conduct regular community monitoring of nomadic families, making sure their rights are not violated and controlling the quality of ecosystem services provided.
Under plans to help the indigenous people of the Far North develop sustainably, the Company is continuing the procedure to obtain their free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC)(1) for the Yamal LNG and Arctic LNG 2 projects and regularly assesses the effectiveness of the planned initiatives.
For more details on protecting the rights of local communities and indigenous peoples of the Far North, see the Contribution to Regional Development section, p. 136.
Safeguarding employee rights is the Company’s priority. We do not tolerate forced or child labor and guarantee our employees protection from any kind of discrimination or persecution. We believe that the diverse backgrounds of our employees contribute to teams’ strong performance, and we strive for diversity in our team.
The Company communicates its human rights commitments to employees through the internal corporate system and training courses in various areas.
We recognize and value our employees’ right to collective bargaining and freedom of association. Collective bargaining agreements cover 90% of the Company’s employees.
For more details on protecting employee rights, see the Diversity and Inclusion section, p. 126.
We are committed to protecting human rights, not only within the Company, but also across its footprint. NOVATEK strictly observes all human rights standards when working with contractors and expects them to adhere to the same principles. We take all the necessary steps to mitigate risks when contractors work at our production facilities. In 2022, 100% of suppliers of the core process equipment passed the audit for compliance with social criteria.
We also take seriously our responsibility to monitor cumulative environmental and social impacts from our production, expecting our suppliers to be environmentally and socially responsible. When starting to work with new suppliers, we implement due diligence procedures to assess, among other things, human rights risks.
For more details, see the Supply Chain section, p. 54.
For more details on the reporting channels, see Appendix, Contacts, p. 191, for more details on report investigation, see the Ethics section, p. 44.
Reporting human rights violations. 
Employee rights (1) FPIC (Free, Prior, and Informed Consent) — the right of indigenous peoples and communities to make go/no-go decisions to control business projects before they affect their traditional crafts and occupations.
Human rights matters may be raised via the Ethics and Human Rights Line (ethics@novatek.ru) or the Security Hotline for fraud and corruption (security_hotline@novatek.ru).
NOVATEK’s core business is based in the Arctic zone, which accounts for not only 100% of the Company’s reserves, but also its key operating assets, employing 64% of NOVATEK employees (59% of them working in the YamalNenets Autonomous Region). Protecting and developing the Arctic territories is a priority on the national level.
Operating in Harsh Arctic Conditions. 
The Company fully supports the implementation of the Strategy in each of its key aspects, strengthening the regional economic well-being, taking a responsible approach to exploration and production, developing logistics along the Northern Sea Route, supporting indigenous communities, and protecting the environment.

Ensuring the well-being of employees and local communities. 
Understanding this, we make every effort to mitigate or compensate for the impact of the Arctic conditions on the health and quality of life of our employees as well as the fact that, due to the low population density of the region, most employees work at the Company’s Arctic enterprises on a rotational basis, meaning they stay away from home and their families for a defined period of time.
Work in the Arctic is a serious challenge for those living and working in this region.

To drive the successful achievement of its strategic, environmental, and climate change targets, NOVATEK set up an executive remuneration system based, among other things, on criteria for measuring goal attainment on sustainability. To enable an evaluation of performance against these goals, key performance indicators (KPIs) have been established, including their scope and weights.
One of the ESG-related KPIs is the HSE Management System performance index, reflecting, among other things, climate. It constitutes a proportion of 10%–15% within the overall set of KPIs for top managers of both subsidiaries and the Company.
Performance against this KPI is assessed by calculating an integral indicator and comparing it against the set target. The assessment of whether this KPI has been achieved depends on several indicators:
Sustainability KPIs. 
Work-related accident, lost time injury in 2022. In the event of a work-related fatality, the entire integral indicator is considered not to have been achieved.

To implement the Regulations, the Company has developed internal documents governing various aspects of the RMICS functioning, including risk management, internal audit, combating corruption, compliance with business ethics, control over insider information, processing and use of personal data, etc.
In 2022, the Company presented the Risk Map for 2023–2025 to the Management Board and Audit Committee, identifying several risks associated with addressing current challenges. The Risk Map also included updates to previously identified risks, encompassing the following: • the impact of external restrictions on the Company’s operations, such as the exit of foreign service providers, equipment and technology suppliers, embargoes on product sales, etc.; • property damage, suspension of operations, and environmental impacts resulting from potential accidents; and • physical and transitional climate risks, achieving 2030 environmental goals, etc.
The Company has established a dedicated Risk Control Division, which is responsible for coordinating risk management activities and maintaining a centralized approach to securing insurance coverage for the Company.
The Company utilizes a Risk Map to categorize and describe risks, including those related to sustainability that may threaten the achievement of the Company’s Targets on a planning horizon from one to three years. The Company’s Risk Map undergoes annual updates and is subject to review by both the Management Board and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Assessing opportunities. 
In 2022, we took a significant step by organizing existing development opportunities for the Company and creating NOVATEK’s Opportunities Map, which was presented to the Management Board and the Audit Committee for consideration.
A significant portion of the opportunities identified pertains to climate change-related issues, encompassing both the physical consequences of climate change and the pressing matters of energy transition in reducing the carbon footprint resulting from human activities: • expanding LNG production as the primary energy resource during the transition from carbon-intensive energy sources, such as oil and coal, toward carbon-free (renewable) sources; • developing decarbonization projects to meet consumer demands for products (including electricity) with a minimal carbon footprint; • using the opportunities presented by the Northern Sea Route because of changing climatic conditions in the Arctic; and • enhancing operational efficiency by digitizing business processes, etc.
In the reporting year, the Company implemented the Double Materiality Principle for the first time to define material topics of the Report. The cost estimate of the impact of potential sustainability risks was factored into the prioritization of material topics of the Report.
The Company regularly develops and conducts risk management activities, including adaptation to external challenges, stress testing, developing business continuity plans, and taking out insurance.
In 2022, external restrictions were imposed on Russian companies. Top management is actively taking essential measures to ensure the Company operates efficiently in a constrained environment and to minimize any adverse impact on NOVATEK’s operational and strategic goals.
PAO NOVATEK runs stress tests to assess the Company’s resilience to the potential impact of the most significant risks using various tools.

For more detail on key events and efforts to adapt to external constraints, see the Adapting to External Challenges in 2022 chapter, p. 8.
Since 2018, the Company has been developing business continuity plans for serious accident and fault risk scenarios at process facilities to enable prompt responses, reduce costs, and expedite the restoration of production at critical process facilities. Business continuity planning went ahead in 2022.
NOVATEK widely uses compulsory and voluntary insurance programs. All insurance programs involve major Russian insurance companies with a proven reputation and high ratings of insurance companies.
Business continuity plans. 
Risk insurance. 
For more details on PAO NOVATEK’s insurance programs, see PAO NOVATEK’s Annual Report 2022.
The Company annually conducts scenario modeling of emergencies to determine potential damage to property and losses from business interruption under various risk scenarios. Stress-testing enables the Company to identify optimal insurance parameters, facilitates the development of response plans, and significantly reduces the probability of future risk events.
Strategic and operational planning as well as the planning and implementation of major investment projects consider environmental factors with a significant potential impact on financial performance. These include internal carbon pricing, which is used to analyze investment project sensitivity to carbon regulation.
The Company studies climaterelated physical risks. Stress testing of foundation strength and production cycle safety for changes in environmental parameters is used in the design and construction of buildings and other permanent structures within the key regions of operation, followed up by planning of adaptation to climate change.

44/45 Sustainability Management PAO NOVATEK Sustainability Report 2022 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08. 
The primary document that defines the Company’s position on business conduct is the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code”). Its primary objective is to effectively communicate our core values and ethical principles to all stakeholders. In 2022, the Board of Directors approved a new version of the Code, considering current legislation, international practices, and the Company’s commitments.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. 
Upholding high ethical standards is a fundamental principle of PAO NOVATEK’s business conduct. Our approach is guided by the highest standards and best practices, and we actively seek to share this expertise across the entire value chain.
NOVATEK’s zero tolerance for any form of human rights violation, corruption, or fraud is essential for the long-term success of its business and society as a whole.
Ethics. 
The Chairman of the Management Board is responsible for upholding compliance with the Code, and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors exercises general compliance oversight. This includes receiving annual reports on the operation of the Ethics and Human Rights Line and any identified Code violations.
The Code is regularly reviewed by a dedicated unit to assess the need for updates, ensuring alignment with current legal rules, and the Company’s obligations and routines. The Code applies to all employees of PAO NOVATEK. In 2022, all employees acknowledged receipt of, and signed, the new version of the Code, which was made available on both the Company’s website and its intranet portal.
Ethical business conduct entails ensuring and respecting the rights of all stakeholders the Company engages with, including employees, contractors, and local community members.
The Company recognizes conflicts of interest as a primary factor contributing to corrupt behavior. Both the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and the Regulations on the Management of Conflicts of Interest mandate that employees disclose any potential or actual conflict of interest. To manage the associated risks, the Company has implemented a routine of regular employee disclosure by asking them to complete the relevant declaration forms on conflicts of interest. Candidates for vacant positions are also screened for conflicts of interest during the job application process through a special questionnaire.
NOVATEK operates in strict compliance with the anti-corruption laws of the Russian Federation and the laws of the countries in which the Company operates. The Company’s anti-corruption position is set forth in the Anti-Corruption Policy.
Annually, the Company formulates an action plan to prevent corruption, ensuring effective implementation of the provisions of the Anti-Corruption Policy. The plan is adjusted based on the outcomes of the previous period. The results of the undertaken efforts and new plans are reviewed annually at a meeting of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
NOVATEK ensures the Anti-Corruption Policy is communicated to all employees and other stakeholders as a matter of course. At 2022-end, 100% of employees, senior management and business partners had reviewed and signed the provisions of the Policy.
Respecting human rights. 
Conflicts of interest. 
Anti-corruption. 
That is why NOVATEK not only complies with all applicable laws and regulations in the countries where it operates, but also incorporates international best practices into its internal corporate policies and standards.
For more details, see further in the Grievance mechanisms subsection, p. 47.
In addition to the Code, the Company’s business ethics position is further defined through other key documents, including the Anti-Corruption Policy, the Supplier Code of Conduct, the Human Rights Policy, and the Regulations on the Management of Conflicts of Interest.
The Company’s approach is based on five key principles: 1 Knowledge of and compliance with legislation 2 Transparency, reliability, and integrity 3 Respect for property rights 4 Professionalism and effectiveness 5 Respect for human rights 1

Over the past year, we continued to ensure our employees’ right to a safe and comfortable work environment, and maintain a healthy environment, which supports traditional economic activities within our communities.
For more details on the protection of human rights, see the Human Rights section, p. 24.
No instances of noncompliance with anti-corruption laws were reported, and no internal investigations regarding potential violations were conducted in 2022.

For example, an online course called The Basics of the Company’s Anti-Corruption Policy and Employee Anti-Corruption Conduct has been developed and made available to all employees through the intranet portal. The course is mandatory for new starters and available at any time for refresher training. In addition to covering the key provisions of the Anti-Corruption Policy, the course also includes information on various aspects of human rights protection and the principles of business ethics. In 2023, the Company plans to conduct training sessions for its employees and controlled entities, focusing on anti-corruption prevention and enforcement, and avoidance of conflict of interest.
To evaluate and improve the knowledge of executives responsible for implementing the Anti-Corruption Policy at NOVATEK’s controlled entities, the Anti-Corruption Policy Advisor conducts annual assessments and training sessions focusing on changes in legislation. In 2022, all executive employees who completed the testing and training subsequently held educational events in their respective organizations.
Anti-corruption training. 
In 2023, the Company intends to undertake a corruption risk assessment aimed at identifying individuals, business processes, and transactions comprising PAO NOVATEK’s operations that are at higher risk of involvement in corruption.
The Company does not hold a dominant position in any market. NOVATEK regularly and thoroughly assesses risks related to competition constraints, unfair competition practices, and other violations of anti-trust laws.
Corruption risk assessment. 
Anti-trust measures. 
The Company has implemented multiple mechanisms that enable stakeholders to file complaints or queries around the clock on any day of the year. PAO NOVATEK’s Ethics and Human Rights Hotline is available in Russian and English for queries related to violations of business conduct and human rights. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is annually informed about the facts of violations in the field of business ethics, which have been identified, including through the grievance mechanisms. In 2022, the hotline received a total of ten queries, with each of the queries thoroughly reviewed and violations confirmed in 20% of the cases. The identified violations had no adverse impact on the Company’s ability to achieve its strategic goals.
PAO NOVATEK and its subsidiaries maintain security hotlines to address concerns regarding conflicts of interest and corruption. In 2022, these hotlines received a total of 1,264 calls. Many of these calls concerned residential natural gas supply.
Regardless of the feedback channel utilized, NOVATEK guarantees confidentiality, anonymity, and protection against retaliation for anyone who reaches out to us. The oversight of measures taken to eliminate identified ethics violations is carried out by the Internal Audit Division, an independently operating unit within the Company that reports directly to the Company’s Board of Directors.
Furthermore, the Yamal LNG and Arctic LNG 2 projects have implemented additional channels for submitting complaints, queries, requests, and suggestions across various domains. These channels also welcome feedback regarding the operation of the grievance mechanisms themselves. The procedures for receiving and processing queries and complaints, including deadlines and the sequence of actions, are established in the applicable local regulations. Queries can be submitted both in person, and by e-mail or over the phone.

NOVATEK demonstrates responsible tax compliance by strictly adhering to all relevant provisions of Russian tax legislation. The Company refrains from engaging in transactions aimed at optimizing tax and does not employ any tax minimization schemes, including those that promote tax base erosion and profit shifting using offshore entities and other methods. Group companies rank among the top taxpayers in the regions where they operate. By making all applicable tax payments to local authorities, NOVATEK makes a substantial contribution to the sustainable social and economic development of the regions in which it operates.
Since 2017, PAO NOVATEK, along with eleven of its subsidiaries and affiliates, has actively engaged in tax monitoring programs. This process guarantees maximum transparency by granting the Federal Tax Service of Russia remote access to taxpayer information systems and tax returns.
NOVATEK operates in full compliance with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidance (the Framework on BEPS) as well as with local transfer pricing legislation of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.

During the reporting year, there were no reports of unethical conduct concerning tax matters from our stakeholders.
NOVATEK annually prepares and submits to relevant tax authorities a master file and a country-by-country Report under BEPS Action 13 and prepares a local file in accordance with the requirements of applicable jurisdictions.
Approach to information security. 
Information security risk management. 
Key initiatives to improve information security. 
NOVATEK takes a systematic approach to information security, striving to meet the highest standards in this area. Information security matters are reviewed annually by the Remuneration and Nomination Committee of the Board of Directors. Operational responsibility for information security lies with the Deputy Chairman of the Management Board reporting to the Chairman of the Management Board.
The key challenges in 2022 included the increased number of information security threats and the urgent need for software and hardware import substitution. Nevertheless, no serious. 
One of the Company’s key focus areas for mitigating information security risks is improving its IT infrastructure security posture. NOVATEK permanently upgrades its existing monitoring system within the framework of its well-developed vulnerability management process.
Each year, the Company engages external contractors who are fully licensed to protect confidential information to detect and fix vulnerabilities in the corporate data network. NOVATEK also deploys a centralized remote access control system for the entire Group to minimize its IT security threat related risks.
Aiming to boost the performance of its information security management system, NOVATEK continuously: • improves employee awareness; • conducts independent external audit; and • engages with supervisory authorities.
The Company is also developing a pilot project to ensure secure access to corporate assets from users’ personal mobile devices. It pays special attention to involve each employee in the process. To this end, a training course is to be developed in 2023, envisaging both theory and practical cyberattack simulations, so that trainees can practice deploying appropriate countermeasures.
Information Security information security incidents, including those related to cyberattacks or data leaks, occurred during the reporting year.
On top of this, the Company has not received any complaints about breaches of confidentiality.

Expansion of the Scientific and Technical Center. 
In May 2022, a Laboratory and Research Center was opened within the STC, which encompasses five laboratories designed to tackle comprehensive research with the use of cutting-edge technologies and equipment. Two laboratories will directly deal with security and environmental monitoring.
NOVATEK has built its own advanced R&D infrastructure to develop and deploy innovative technologies, which includes the Scientific and Technical Center (STC) and the Laboratory and Research Center (LRC), constituting an integral part of the STC. Its innovations include 32 registered patents; Arctic Cascade, the Company’s proprietary natural gas liquefaction technology; new well drilling technologies; and AI tools. In addition to this, the Company runs the Innovator idea management system, enabling employees to put forward initiatives aimed at optimization, reducing costs, and introducing new work practices.
Our cutting-edge R&D base was one of the tailwinds that helped the Company stay sustainable as external restrictions were imposed in 2022. Now that we are facing new challenges, primarily complicated supply chains and a lack of imported equipment, NOVATEK has significantly increased investments into the development of its own proprietary technologies.
Innovation development is a key to sharpening NOVATEK’s competitive edge and boosting its performance. For this very reason, since its establishment, the Company has been actively investing in building its own R&D infrastructure and constantly developing its research potential.
Innovation. 
Investment in R&D. 
Innovation plays a key role in the energy transition. The benefits of innovation enables the Company to effectively extract energy resources with the lowest carbon footprint while ensuring they substitute out more carbon-intensive energy sources, but also to streamline its own carbon footprint management. In 2022, NOVATEK invested in the procurement and installation of solar panels and wind turbines. Moreover, at the beginning of 2023, the Company became a founding member of the Institute for Initiatives in Oil and Gas Technologies, which coordinates industry standardization and technology development efforts between major Russian oil and gas companies.

Key supplier identification and supplier assessment for risk exposure. 
New suppliers screened against social and environmental criteria. 
Supplier evaluation system and observing the rights of parties in the supply chain. 
When evaluating suppliers for risk exposure, the Company considers a variety of factors, such as geographic location, size, sector, and supplier profile as well as its ability to ensure the supplied products will comply with the required characteristics.
Aiming to develop a competitive environment, NOVATEK constantly seeks to expand its supplier pool while regularly conducting market research and participating in industry-specific forums/ conferences to attract new suppliers to bidding. Potential suppliers not meeting the respective supplier qualification criteria are given feedback to improve their production processes and take part in tenders to be held in the future.
In 2022, 100% of suppliers of the core process equipment passed the audit for compliance with environmental and social criteria as part of their qualification process. The new suppliers passed an audit vis-a-vis availability of waste treatment licenses, certificates of environmental registration, compliance of their occupational health system with the Company’s requirements, and availability of relevant permits, licenses, certificates, and other documents confirming that the supplier complied with the established criteria.
A decision to invite suppliers to participate in procurement procedures is taken with due regard to their rating scores. Rating scores are calculated through an assessment of the supplier’s performance under contracts that are already signed with the Company against defined and established criteria, such as the quality and term of developing detailed engineering design documentation, comments on quality as appraised at incoming inspections and on operation, as well as the general level of engagement with the supplier. Based on the appraisal results, a reliability level defined by the rating scale is assigned, ranging from A (high reliability level) to D (critical reliability level). The ESG criteria are considered in the rating structure indirectly: the Company, with all else being equal, gives priority to a supplier who has no or minimal negative environmental and social impacts.
The Company runs a rigorous qualification process to evaluate whether each counterparty has the required professional experience, competences, financial resilience, and business reputation, including whether they have ever violated environmental or labor laws, or standards of business ethics, or human rights.
Requirements for bidders and procured items are set to eliminate prejudice for or against any bidder while minimizing the risk of nonperformance (improper performance) of the contract.
PAO NOVATEK favors open competitive tendering and conducts procurement through an electronic trading platform to ensure the transparency of procedures and the equal treatment. 
All bids are evaluated by a cross-functional team of experts who do not influence each other’s opinion.
of bidders. During the procurement process all bidders get equal access to the documents stipulating the terms, procedure, and deadlines of the tender. They can also request any information they need in greater detail.
Many of the new suppliers audited were for the Arctic LNG 2 project, where the Company managed to adhere to completion deadlines for the continued construction works by competently managing the supply chain despite the external restrictions and challenges encountered during the year.

Supplier relations. 
Support for Russian manufacturers. 
NOVATEK places a strong emphasis on strategic collaboration with its suppliers and the building of mutually beneficial long-term relationships. The Company not only selects its suppliers and follows up on their performance of contractual obligations, but also fosters growth in its manufacturers and provides them with relevant technical support.
Industrial and Energy Forum. 
In September 2022, PAO NOVATEK held a Supplier’s Day as part of the Industrial and Energy Forum in Tyumen. Experts told the audience about the Company’s current and upcoming projects, its needs in equipment and materials, and explained the requirements set for suppliers. Furthermore, as part of the presentation, they highlighted matters relating to supporting Russian entities and import substitution.
Institute of Oil and Gas Technology Initiatives. 
In early 2023, the Board of Directors of NOVATEK decided to join the Institute of Oil and Gas Technology Initiatives (INTI) as a founding member. INTI brings together Russian oil and gas industry companies who are spearheading the creation of a local industry-specific standardization system that would allow the single industry-specific standards to be established for equipment and technologies, a single industry-specific base of tried and trusted suppliers be drafted, and for efforts on import substitution to be implemented across the industry.
As a member of INTI, NOVATEK has put forward an initiative to establish and lead an LNG Committee, which can shape technical policy and standardize the rules and regulations for designing LNG projects and developing LNG-related facilities.
Import substitution of natural gas liquefaction equipment. 
In 2022, as part of import substitution efforts for unique equipment, comprehensive bench tests of a prototype large-capacity LNG cargo pump were successfully completed.
The tests were conducted in line with a program developed in partnership with a leading international oils and gas EPC contactor. The pump was fully dismantled and disassembled between the test stages to examine each element of the equipment. The tests were carried out in St. Petersburg at a test bench that is completely unique in Europe. It was specially constructed to examine cryogenic equipment manufacturing technology for the LNG industry.
During the first half of 2023, an order for a batch of Russian large capacity pumps was placed for the Arctic LNG 2 project.
• invest in setting up our own LNG production and related technologies and capacities to manufacture liquefaction trains; • allocate funds to promote R&D activities among Russian manufacturers to operationalize the production of competitive equipment and materials for LNG-projects; • have developed a mechanism that guarantees that orders are placed with Russian manufacturers who offer innovative products for promising LNG projects on agreed commercial terms and conditions (tentative contracts); and • proactively work with federal executive authorities and contribute to the efforts of cross-functional working groups to localize the production of technologies and equipment in Russia, including through the government support mechanisms.
NOVATEK is consistent in pursuing its import substitution policy regarding critical foreign technologies and equipment to ensure the technological independence of its projects. In particular, we: suppliers. 
Quantitative results of supplier evaluation. 
Number of suppliers who underwent impact evaluation. 
Number of suppliers producing significant potential or actual negative impacts. 
Number of suppliers who had agreed upon the Company’s recommendations for reducing or eliminating their negative impact as of the end of 2022. 
Scheduled audit of suppliers for conformity with environmental and social criteria is conducted once every three years as part of recurring qualification audits. If a supplier fails the qualification audit but wishes to maintain relationships with the Company, it develops a corrective action plan, has it approved by NOVATEK, and implements it within a set timeframe, providing supporting documentation.
Evaluation of suppliers vis-a-vis environmental and social impact 93 36 3. 
In 2022, the Company audited 93 existing and new suppliers. A total of 36 suppliers were found to have a negative impact, with most comments related to potential impact (expired licenses, opacity regarding improvement notices issued by regulators, etc.) rather than actual impact.
Although suppliers address discrepancies voluntarily, three of the suppliers who had a negative impact detected agreed with the Company on improvement measures, with the rest in the process of doing so as of the end of 2022. Until the discrepancies are addressed, the Company has the right to suspend cooperation with the supplier at its own discretion.

Global Climate Action Agenda. 
The past eight years proved to be the warmest on record,(1) which renders the climate action agenda more urgent than ever. According to the reports of the World Economic Forum, climate change risks, risks related to the increased number of extreme weather events, large-scale environmental incidents, and risks of missing international climate targets continue to be ranked among the world’s top risks.
As climate change continues, humanity faces an ambitious challenge: to radically cut GHG emissions, while ensuring the development of the global economy and satisfying the needs of developing economies.
The Paris Agreement member states constantly build up their efforts to curb climate change, aiming at achieving net zero carbon and accelerating the energy transition.(2) As of the beginning of 2023, 130 countries, representing 88% of GHG global emissions, set themselves such goals.(3)
International climate action agenda (1) World Meteorological Organization.
(2) China’s Transition to a Low-Carbon Economy and Climate Resilience Needs Shifts in Resources and Technologies // World Bank.
(3) Net Zero Tracker project.
(4) CO2 Emissions in 2022 // International Energy Agency (IEA).
The European Union (EU) aims to be net zero by 2050, while China and India have committed to the same goal by 2060 and 2070, respectively.
However, despite the measures taken in 2022, global GHG emissions increased to record-breaking values on the back of a change in the energy mix. During the global energy crisis(4) the consumption of more accessible but carbon-intensive fuels such as coal has significantly increased.
Despite external challenges and geopolitical instability in 2022, Russia maintained its focus on achieving net zero by 2060. The relevant regulatory framework and practices are steadily being developed. In particular, in 2022, an experiment aimed at accelerating efforts to achieve carbon neutrality was launched in the Sakhalin Region. In addition, the Register of Carbon Units has been established in Russia, with the first units related to climate projects already registered (e.g., the project to convert Vladivostok CHPP-2 from coal to gas).
In the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region, where the Company carries out its core operations, climate change issues are also top of mind. Local researchers and their Moscow colleagues have assessed potential climate change consequences for the region and worked out a number of measures to mitigate the impact. Such measures include the development of the construction standard for the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region, which pays due regard to climate change, as well as the creation of a climate change monitoring system and a system to forecast climate change impact on the ecosystem.
Climate change not only fuels the growth of risks, but also creates opportunities. For instance, year-round use of the Northern Sea Route is of special importance for Russia, and its development would facilitate enhanced energy security across South-East Asian countries.

Energy Transition. 
Energy transition and the role of gas. 
A sustainable energy transition toward carbon neutrality is achievable, provided the energy used is altogether clean, ensuring power with reduced emissions, that is accessible and safe and permanently fulfilling the basic needs of society.
The role of natural gas in the World Energy Trilemma(1)
Should any of the trilemma components dominate, it would inevitably lead to an imbalance and energy insecurity. Since gas meets the requirements of all three trilemma components, this concept was laid as a foundation for NOVATEK’s 2017 strategy.
In 2021, amid a rapid bounce back of economy, demand spiked, causing energy prices to skyrocket. In 2022, the situation was aggravated by external restrictions. Furthermore, some regions experienced weather conditions unsuitable for renewable energy generation (lower wind speed and low river flow), which led to a reduced volume of energy produced from renewables.
The most vulnerable turned out to be developing economies, where, in 2022, the number of people without access to electricity reached its highest since records began: 775 million.(2) (1) World Energy Trilemma Index 2022 // World Energy Council.
(2) For the First Time in Decades, the Number of People without Access to Electricity Is Set to Increase in 2022 // IEA.
(3) Advantages and Challenges of Wind Energy // US Department of Energy.
(4) Carbon Dioxide Emissions Coefficients by Fuel // Energy Information Agency.
SUSTAINABILITY. 
SECURITY. 
AFFORDABILITY. 
In 2022, the European Commission included natural gas in the EU’s Green Taxonomy. 
This is a classification system establishing a list of environmentally sustainable economic activities facilitating the transition to carbon neutrality.
The taxonomy constitutes a basis for fundraising under the green financing program as well as for the development of a project state subsidizing system. In addition, natural gas is an important element in the energy transition strategy of the largest Asian economies, such as India and China.
The current energy and carbon crisis demonstrated that a sustainable energy transition is not possible without a diversified energy mix.
The shortage in energy resources sparked an uptick in the use of coal, the most accessible but least eco-friendly fuel. In 2022, consumption of coal, the largest source of carbon emissions, broke its all-time high, surpassing 8 billion tons. The total CO2 emissions from electricity generation reached a peak of 36.8 billion tons in 2022, 42% of which was produced using coal. Coal consumption is expected to grow up to 2025.
The World Energy Trilemma. 
Reflects a nation’s capacity to meet current and future energy demand reliably, withstand and bounce back swiftly from system shocks with minimal disruption to supplies. 
Assesses a country’s ability to provide universal access to affordable, fairly priced, and abundant energy for domestic and commercial use. 
Represents the transition of a country’s energy system towards mitigating and avoiding potential environmental harm and climate change impacts • Large natural gas reserves • Stable production technology • Diversity of suppliers • Independence from natural conditions • A low carbon footprint compared to other types of hydrocarbons • The possibility to create low-carbon fuel (ammonia, hydrogen)
Advantages of natural gas that help address the trilemma • Relative low cost • Accessibility of supplies and infrastructure that can be easily. 
Though renewable energy is getting increasingly popular, its development is restricted due to several limitations,(3) including cost, infrastructure complexity, and weather dependence. In such circumstances, natural gas, which has the lowest carbon intensity(4) among all fossil fuels and is more accessible and reliable than renewable energy sources, is an inseparable part of the energy transition program by ensuring energy security.

The Asia-Pacific countries are expected to account for 30% of the global demand for natural gas by 2050. This will allow the region to maintain its position as the leading LNG importer.(1)
Apart from its mitigation of climate impact, the use of gas contributes to a reduction in environmental footprint, as its production is relatively clean. The production cycle does not include any critical minerals,(2) the mining, production, and utilization of which are frequently related to damages to the environment.
(3) The avoided GHG emissions were calculated by comparing GHG emissions produced by LNG and coal firing with due regard to their calorific capacity in TJ and considering the relevant emission factors applied by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
The role of NOVATEK in the energy transition. 
Indirect GHG emissions (Scope 3) from scheduled LNG projects (57 million tons in 2030) million tons of CO2 equivalent. 
NOVATEK, as one of the world largest suppliers of natural gas and LNG, contributes meaningfully to the energy transition.
The Company not only continuously increases its own energy efficiency, but also provides its consumers with natural gas that has record-breaking low carbon intensity when compared to industry average values, which facilitates a lower climate impact throughout the value chain.
By 2030, the Company plans to produce up to 57–70 million tons of LNG per year (accounting for a 100% share), which would allow our consumers to avoid 95–117 million tons of CO2 emissions per year in their transition from coal to gas.(3)

In 2022, the Company suggested several measures aimed at achieving the approved climate change and environmental targets for the period up to 2030. The targets were set with due regard to the need to hold the increase in the global temperature to well below 2 °C (the so-called 2 °C scenario). 2019 was adopted as the baseline year.
To achieve its climate change and environmental targets, the Company is implementing a comprehensive program. In 2022, the program focused on atmospheric air protection.
The Company has fully embraced the Paris Climate Agreement, which has been ratified by the Russian Federation, and makes every effort to curb GHG emissions.
The Company has ambitious goals to further improve its efficiency on the path to net zero, despite NOVATEK already having reached one of the lowest levels of GHG emission intensity in the industry.
• At the operational level, the Deputy Chairman of the Management Board – Director for Prospective Projects oversees decarbonization projects.
• Matters related to GHG emissions management fall directly within the authority of the Deputy Chairman of the Management Board – Operations Director, who is responsible for the Integrated HSE Management System.
• Matters related to the implementation of the Company’s climate agenda are included in the senior management’s incentive system and set out in relevant KPIs.

Climate change management. 
Climate change topics are monitored at the level of the Board of Directors and its committees. Since 2021, the Subcommittee on Climate and Alternative Energy functions within the Board of Directors’ Strategy Committee.
Given the external uncertainty and restrictions in 2022, the focus of the subcommittee was on the first priority goals, such as to achieve the set climate change and environmental targets, to develop wind energy and CO2 capture and underground storage projects on the Yamal Peninsula.
Introduction of internal carbon pricing. 
To assess the risks of carbon regulation on economic indicators of investment projects, the Company introduced internal carbon pricing in 2022. Relevant changes were introduced in the Procedure Rules for the drafting, agreement, approval, monitoring, and updating of PAO NOVATEK’s investment projects.
Such an approach adheres to an industry best practice and captures the effect of setting the costs of GHG emissions when investment decisions are made, while stimulating investments into low-carbon alternatives and improving GHG emission management.
In setting its carbon price, NOVATEK uses a differential approach: • in respect of projects envisaging sales of products in the domestic market: 10 USD per ton of СО2. The benchmark for pricing is set by Resolution of the Russian Government No. 1441, dated 18 August 2022; • in respect of export-oriented projects: 40 USD per ton of CO2. This price was determined based on the assessed cost of implementing measures aimed at reducing GHG emissions and industry practices.
To evaluate the resilience of investment projects against carbon regulatory factors, we conduct an analysis of sensitivity to internal carbon price changes. Vented GHG emissions (direct and energy indirect GHG emissions, Scope 1 and 2) are considered during the evaluation.
In the reporting year, the Investment Committee of the Company considered several projects where the internal carbon pricing was considered for the purposes of economic efficiency analysis.
The analysis found that projects were highly resilient to internal carbon pricing.

Calculation methodology for GHG footprint from LNG cargoes at Yamal LNG. 
In 2022, the Company completed the development of Guidelines on Quantification of GHG Emissions by OAO Yamal LNG, its own methodology for calculating GHG emissions at all stages of the LNG production life cycle at the Yamal LNG project to confirm the GHG footprint of each LNG cargo for its consumers, thus becoming one of the first companies in Russia that provides its customers with complete information based on data from the entire production cycle. The methodology enables customers purchasing LNG from the Company to determine the carbon footprint of their activities with a higher precision.
The Guidelines were developed using generally accepted international standards.(1)
In 2023, the Guidelines are going to be validated by an independent accredited organization, which will enable Yamal LNG to supply LNG with GHG emissions statements for each cargo. In addition, in 2023, the Company is also going to start developing a similar methodology for the CryogasVysotsk project.

Permafrost related risks. 
With most the Company’s industrial sites located in the Russian Arctic, the front-end engineering, design, construction, and operation of buildings and facilities are performed with a particular focus on researching, evaluating, forecasting, and monitoring the permafrost and cryogenic processes.
With the geotechnical monitoring system, the Company is capable of detecting changes in climate processes at incipient stages, determining the type and intensity of admissible anthropogenic loads on the environment, ensuring engineering facilities are sufficiently reliable and safe, and optimizing financial costs. Information regarding the condition of, and changes in, the natural environment gathered over the course of the monitoring allows for preventive measures to be taken to exclude/ mitigate negative impacts.
Project-specific solutions implemented by the Company incorporate physical risks associated with climate change, which are revealed with due regard to climate change scenarios, such as: • a potential rise in temperatures by up to 4 °C; and • an associated rise in the upper soil temperature up to 2 °C.
Potential risks to gravity-based structure foundations related to climate change are identified and analyzed as part of Hazard Identification (HAZID) and Environmental Impact Identification (ENVID) procedures. Based on an analysis of global warming scenarios, design solutions incorporate a significant safety margin. In addition to climate change, the design also factors in the risks of natural hazards. The main construction and engineering solutions for buildings and structures are designed to withstand natural and anthropogenic disasters, such as strong winds, snowfalls, extremely low temperatures, fires, etc.
Should any deviations from the reference metrics be found, the collected data are analyzed and, if required, additional research is conducted, with measures to stabilize the geotechnical system worked out and implemented.
The opportunities of climate change. 
Expansion of navigation along the Northern Sea Route. 
Studying and producing new low-carbon energy products. 
Developing decarbonization and renewable energy projects. 
Global warming leads to a gradual extension of the navigation periods in the Arctic zone. Roundthe-year logistics along the Northern Sea Route would allow the Company to deliver cargoes to European and Asia-Pacific countries via the shortest route, which is a competitive edge. 
As part of its support of global initiatives to reduce anthropogenic impacts on climate, the Company develops its own decarbonization and low-carbon product projects to diversify its product mix and safeguard future sustainability. 
There is technical potential for further implementation of decarbonization projects to further reduce the GHG footprint of the Company’s own products and provide decarbonization services to other stakeholders • Organization of control and monitoring of air temperature, water level in the Northern Sea Route, permafrost, and ice conditions • Further implementation of the Company’s program to expand the navigation window in the eastern sector of the Northern Sea Route • Constructing LNG transshipment terminals in Murmansk and on the Kamchatka Peninsula • Entering into long-term agreements with shipping companies to provide the necessary ice breaker assistance for ships on the Northern Sea Route • The Company’s own R&D efforts to produce ammonia/hydrogen • Designing low-carbon blue ammonia production facilities • Expanding markets for low-carbon products, entering into long-term agreements with prospective customers • Development and implementation of technologies enabling CO2 capture, injection, and storage in geological formations • Participation in the carbon market (as an issuer) • Use of cogeneration technologies for heat generation • Increase in the APG utilization rate • Expanding the use of renewables at the Company’s major facilities. 
Global warming and the world sea level rise, along with physical risks, offer many opportunities for the Company. The Company identified and analyzed these opportunities for the first time in 2022.
The key climate change-related opportunities include:
For more details on the key opportunities and measures to support their implementation, see Appendix 1. Key Sustainability Risks and Opportunities p. 146.
The Company conducts physical checks of buildings and facilities located in permafrost soil areas to check their condition on an annual basis.

The Company operates a comprehensive Environmental Management System, including the GHG Emissions Management System, which was designed in accordance with ISO 14064:1 and the Guidelines for Calculating GHG Emissions approved by the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment.(1)
In 2022, Bureau Veritas Certification Rus, an independent auditor, confirmed NOVATEK’s GHG Emissions Management System was compliant with. 
ISO 14064:1,
Greenhouse gases – Part 1: Specification with guidance at the organization level for quantification and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and removals.
In line with this standard, GHG emissions measurement and reporting are included in the Integrated Management System (IMS). NOVATEK assesses risks and opportunities at least once a year, reviewing GHG emissions reports that are submitted to the Company by subsidiaries and joint ventures. An unscheduled assessment of risks and opportunities is conducted when the target metrics change, or a stakeholder request is received.
As part of the system, NOVATEK approved a standard that sets out basic principles and requirements for implementing its GHG emissions management system, including: • inventory of GHG emissions at controlled entities within the NOVATEK Group; • calculation of GHG emission factors; • creation of a GHG inventory; and • reporting in line with Order of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment No. 300 as well as with stakeholder requests.
As part of this broader system, NOVATEK has compiled an inventory of GHG emissions sources and developed an automated GHG estimation module within the GHG Management System, defining GHG emission intensity targets for each business line (hydrocarbon production and processing, and LNG production).
Since 2008, NOVATEK has been annually disclosing information on GHG emissions and energy efficiency in line with the recommendations of the global Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) initiative.
The volumes of emissions are also verified annually by an independent auditor. In the first half of 2023, an audit of emissions data for each scope in 2022 was completed, and a “Reasonable” level of assurance was obtained from the independent auditor Bureau Veritas Certification Rus.

One of the key energy-saving technologies widely deployed by the Company at all new construction sites is cogeneration, which involves using heat from flue gases of gas turbines and gas engine generators as a secondary energy resource.
120 thousand tons of CO2 equivalent. 
Direct GHG emissions avoided in 2022 are estimated to total 2.5 million GJ, or 70% of total heat consumption. 
In 2022, secondary energy-based heat generation increased by 3% year-on-year to. 
Boosting energy efficiency. 
Rational use of resources is one of the key principles of NOVATEK’s energy policy.
Although NOVATEK’s energy consumption is relatively low for the oil and gas industry, the Company strives to increase the energy efficiency of existing facilities and apply advanced highly efficient technologies at new projects to cut expenses and reduce stationary combustion.
In 2022, the Company launched its Comprehensive Program of Energy-Saving Measures(1) for 2022–2024 to boost operational energy efficiency and resource efficiency. The program comprises the deployment of energy-saving technologies and advanced energy-efficient equipment, as well as measures aimed at reducing energy consumption across all areas of production activities.
For the first year of the program, energy consumption decreased by 264.2 thousand GJ (for 2022 and the ongoing effect of earlier adopted measures), up sixfold year-on-year. The GHG emissions avoided through the energy saving program in 2022 totaled 16 thousand tons of CO2 equivalent.

To gauge the energy intensity of technological processes, energy consumption per unit of production is measured. In 2022, electricity consumption per unit in gas production dropped by 8% year-on-year to 2.3 kWh per thousand cubic meters. Electricity consumption per unit in gas liquification rose by 7% to 99.8 kWh per ton amid increased load at the Yamal LNG project exceeding design capacity, the additional use of compressor electric drives, and higher demand of train booster compressors and boil-off gas compressors in cold seasons.
The Company set a target (upper limit) for electricity consumption per unit in gas and gas condensate production and treatment at 4.5 kWh per ton. In 2022, per unit electricity consumption amounted to 4.3 kWh per ton, remaining below this cap.
Electricity consumption per unit for the Group in 2022 amounted to 0.03 GJ per boe (0.02 GJ per boe in 2021). The growth is associated with an increase in electricity consumption against an increase in construction and installation works at the LNG Construction Center and an increase in LNG production. At the same time, electricity consumption attributable to upstream facilities remains stable over the last three years at 0.01 GJ per boe.

Methane emissions reduction. 
The reduction of methane emissions is one of the Company’s key decarbonization goals.
NOVATEK has set the target to reduce methane emissions per unit of production in the upstream, processing, and LNG segments by 4% by 2030 to 9.96 tons per million boe compared to the 2019 baseline. Specific measures under this goal are included in the Company’s Comprehensive Environmental and Climate Change Targets Program.
Methane emissions in 2022 were 6,343 tons, decreasing by 22% year-on-year, while specific methane emissions in the production, processing and LNG segments dropped by 24%, down to 9.83 tons per million boe. The main factors driving the decrease were the reduction of wastewater combustion resulting from the implementation of a project to treat and inject process water into reservoirs at the Yurkharovskoye field, streamlining the compressor equipment at the Yarudeyskoye field and, as a consequence, reduction in APG flaring.
The share of methane emissions in total GHG emissions amounted to 1.7% (2.0% in 2021).

Methane emissions intensity ratio for hydrocarbon production, processing, and LNG facilities tons/million boe 14.4 12.9 9.8 2020 2021 2022. 
The Company tests various elements of a multi-level leak detection system, which enables leaks to be found promptly at any section of the production process. In 2022, the Company, through relevant measures and reduced flaring, managed to significantly decrease the total volume of methane emissions and their specific share in the production and processing segments.
As a participant of the Methane Guiding Principles global initiative, the Company has access to best industry practices and is able to constantly improve its own leak prevention system.
Reduction in flaring. 
A reduction in flaring, including APG combustion, makes the most significant contribution to total reduction in direct GHG emissions.
In 2022, GHG emissions from flaring were reduced by 23% to 1,935 thousand tons of CO2 equivalent, which was primarily due to the decrease in fuel gas process losses after start-up and commissioning works were competed at Yamal LNG Train 4 in 2021. The use of mobile flowback and well testing packages and the optimization of compressor equipment operation at the Yarudeyskoye field had an extra positive impact on the reduction in flaring.

Mobile flowback and well testing packages. 
Mobile flowback and well testing packages are required for emissionfree well testing. They are used to measure hydrocarbon reserves and evaluate asset parameters throughout the field development life cycle. Their deployment has reduced our gas losses and GHG and other pollutant emissions.

Following the tests, well products are supplied to a gas collection header and to further processing, thus avoiding flaring.
Tests were conducted at a number of wells across the Urengoyskoye, North-Russkoye, East-Tazovskoye, Yurkharovskoye, WestYurkharovskoye, East-Urengoyskoye, and North-Esetinskoye fields.
The packages were also used for multistage hydraulic fracturing followed by zero-emission flowback.
The combustion volume halved year-onyear, while the APG utilization level rose by 98.0% through a number of measures, including injecting APG into reservoirs to enhance oil recovery, and processing and delivering APG to the trunk pipeline network.
The Company has set a goal to increase the APG utilization rate to 99% by 2030.

Renewable energy sources. 
The Company makes efforts to consistently increase the proportion of renewable electricity in its total energy mix, both through purchasing energy from renewables for its own enterprises from external partners and producing its own renewable energy.
Small-scale renewable energy installations are used to supply power to telemechanics units at inter-field pipelines and well pads at the Company’s gas condensate fields. The total number of such renewable energy systems in 2022 was 167, up 13% year-on-year. In 2022, we generated a total of 322 thousand kWh of electricity from renewable sources, up more than half year-on-year (209 thousand kWh in 2021), which represents 0.01% of NOVATEK’s total electricity generation. The greenhouse gases avoided due to the substitution of conventional generation with renewables totaled about 307 tons of CO2 equivalent.
Starting from 2022, the Company began purchasing renewable energy to substitute energy produced through hydrocarbon combustion at the Cryogas-Vysotsk LNG plant, which allowed it to decrease indirect GHG emissions by 3 thousand tons of CO2 equivalent. In 2022, the share of renewables in Cryogas-Vysotsk’s energy consumption mix was 86% (22,884 thousand kWh).

Prospective decarbonization projects. 
NOVATEK is considering registration of its environmental initiatives as climate projects.
In October 2022, NOVATEK and ROSATOM signed a memorandum providing for the purchase of electricity, including electricity generated at ROSATOM’s wind farms, to meet the needs of the Ust-Luga Complex.
The project promises to reduce the carbon footprint of the Company’s products.
Low-carbon ammonia. 
In 2022, NOVATEK decided to take part in the development of a Russian low-carbon ammonia production technology. Carbon dioxide (CO2) will be captured and put into a longterm geological storage (CCS).
In 2022, as part of a pre-FEED with international engineering companies, NOVATEK developed a concept of CCS infrastructure for utilization of CO2 from its prospective low-carbon ammonia production complex. The infrastructure includes a CO2 treatment plant (compression and dehydration), a CO2 pipeline, and a site with disposal wells. The infrastructure is fit for utilizing CO2, including from the Yamal LNG plant.

CO2 underground storage. 
A concept has been developed for underground CO2 storage at the Obskiy license area, in close proximity to the production facilities of the prospective low-carbon ammonia production complex and the Yamal LNG project. In 2022, we completed the first stage of international certification for longterm underground CO2 storage sites on the Yamal and Gydan Peninsulas. Pursuant to the issued certificates, the geological formations at the peninsulas have the capacity to store at least 600 million tons of CO2 each, which is supported by calculations.
Obsky license area. 
Wind energy. 
In 2022, NOVATEK completed a wind measurement program and explored technical solutions for a wind power plant (wind farm) project in Sabetta, achieving an installed capacity factor of 50%, which is well above the average for WPPs in Russia (about 30%–35%). The Company developed requirements to the wind turbines design, which consider specific wind parameters such as smooth variability of wind speed, low turbulence, and air density increase at negative temperatures. The wind farm will supply power to the Company’s existing and planned production facilities in Sabetta, thus reducing the carbon footprint of their products (LNG and ammonia).

Gas and LNG production increases. 
NOVATEK’s corporate strategy assumes an increasing role of LNG in the future global energy mix, where it replaces coal, fuel oil, and diesel fuel, thus reducing emissions of GHG and harmful air pollutants.
The Company makes significant efforts to develop LNG projects and increase their production volumes in line with its business strategy and sustainable development strategy. As a result, in 2022, gas production increased by 2.8% to 82.14 billion cubic meters and its share in the total hydrocarbon production mix rose to 84.1%.

2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 83.4 83.2 82.8 82.0 80.8 84.1 2022. 
Total LNG production in 2022 increased by 6.5% to 22 million tons (or 13 million tons considering our proportionate share in the production of joint ventures), primarily due to production rampup at the Yamal LNG project. Now the Company is developing a number of other projects to increase LNG production in the near future. One of the largest among them, Arctic LNG 2, is planning to launch its first processing line in 2023.
Indirect GHG emissions (Scope 3) from LNG sales in 2022 million tons of CO2 equivalent. 
Indirect GHG emissions from LNG projects. 
Calculated volume of avoided GHG emissions in transition from coal to LNG –21 34. 
Expansion of LNG distribution channels. 
NOVATEK’s strategy envisages active participation in the development of the market for natural gas as NGV fuel, which would allow consumers to reduce their GHG footprint and transition from more carbon intensive fuels.
To meet increasing needs in transport fuel, given the pool of LNG vehicles is growing in the Russian regions, the Company is increasing the number of small-scale LNG projects: in 2020, a plant was launched in Magnitogorsk, and new capacities are going to be commissioned in the Moscow and Samara Regions in the medium term, which will cut the LNG transportation leg and provide fuel for vehicles in the Central and the Volga Federal Districts.
The substitution of diesel with LNG significantly reduces nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide emissions and almost entirely eliminates particulate emissions. At 2022-end, 13 LNG fueling stations operated across Russia, with their sales volume standing at 51 thousand tons: over double the value of the previous year.
Expansion of navigation along the Northern Sea Route. 
Since 2017, following the launch of its first large-scale Yamal LNG project, NOVATEK forged ahead with expanding navigation along the Northern Sea Route to secure safe and reliable LNG shipments.
Deliveries to Asia-Pacific countries via the Northern Sea Route offer the highest potential although the NSR’s eastern leg is the most complicated in terms of ice conditions. Using this route: • reduces the delivery times to Asia-Pacific countries by half in summer and by a third in winter compared to the traditional route around Eurasia through the Suez Canal. For instance, in summer, transportation to China takes 17 to 20 days via the Northern Sea Route and about 36 days through the Suez Canal; and • cuts GHG emissions by 7 thousand tons per round trip on average as the distance and transportation time are reduced.
In 2022, a total of 32 LNG cargoes were shipped from the port of Sabetta to the Asian-Pacific market via the Northern Sea Route.
The Company also strives to continuously expand its navigation window in the eastern segment of the Arctic, which totaled nine and a half months in 2022 compared to seven months in 2018. In the medium term, we are planning to transition to year-round transportation of LNG to Asia-Pacific countries following the launch of Arctic LNG 2, the Company’s second large-scale LNG project.
To optimize Arctic LNG transportation, a construction project for two LNG transshipment complexes on the Kamchatka Peninsula and in the Murmansk Region is being implemented. Each terminal includes a 360 thousand cubic meters floating LNG storage tank.
NOVATEK rapidly expands its market reach in the emerging Asia-Pacific countries, where demand for natural gas is growing steadily due to the phase-out of more carbon-intensive fuels, such as coal and fuel oil. In 2022, supplies of our LNG helped customers avoid the emission of 21 million tons of CO2 equivalent.
By converting to LNG, a much cleaner motor fuel, NOVATEK customers avoided 27.3 thousand tons of СО2 emissions in 2022.

Management Approach. 
NOVATEK recognizes the oil and gas industry’s environmental impact, and therefore the Company views minimizing this impact and using natural resources, including water as its priority.
NOVATEK strives not only to prevent adverse environmental impacts, but also to improve the environment for future generations.
HSE issues are monitored both at the Company’s highest governance level by the Remuneration and Nomination Committee of the Board of Directors, and at the executive level by the Deputy Chairman of the Management Board – Operations Director.
For more details on matters considered by the Remuneration and Nomination Committee, see the Sustainability Management system section, p. 32.
Key principles. 
The Company’s environmental protection activities are guided by the precautionary principle, also called the precautionary approach, that is implemented as part of ESIA. This procedure is carried out by independent experts in accordance with the requirements of Russian law and international standards before the construction or revamp of key Company production facilities.(1)
Environmental management system. 
NOVATEK makes every effort to prevent accidents, minimize potential damage, and offset the Company’s environmental footprint: from design to decommissioning of facilities.

ISO 14001 11 of 19(1) (58%) production subsidiaries of the Company are certified to these standards. The Company regularly undergoes surveillance audits of its management system’s compliance. 
In 2022, we updated our Occupational Health, Industrial and Fire Safety, and Environmental Policy. Key drivers behind the update included the launch of LNG production as well as the approval of the Company’s environmental and climate change targets to 2030 in 2020 and development of internal practices of the Company.
The Company is working continuously to bring its environmental management in line with the latest international standards. NOVATEK subsidiaries use the Integrated HSE Management System (IMS), embracing environmental and climate aspects.
In environmental management, the system complies with the international standard ISO 14001. In 2022, an audit by an independent international certification agency found the IMS to be effective and focused on continuous improvement.
Strategic goals in environmental protection. 
Apart from its strategic targets pursuant to the effective Russian laws on environmental protection, the Company sets targets to comply with existing regulatory requirements for water discharge into surface water bodies and abides by international practices, standards, and conventions on biodiversity conservation.
In 2022, despite external headwinds and the geopolitical environment, the Company continued to invest in environmental protection and environmental stewardship, with related expenses totaling RR 2,568 million for the year (RR 2,908 million in 2021). The decline was due to the completion of a number of construction projects, including a wastewater treatment and injection unit at OOO NOVATEKYurkharovneftegas. The bulk of costs came from waste reduction, water protection, and biodiversity conservation initiatives. Apart from the overall spending on environmental protection, the Comprehensive Environmental and Climate Change Targets Program remains a standalone investment item, with RR 352 million spent on it.

Biodiversity. 
The conservation of biodiversity is considered as part of the principles of sustainable development activities.
The fragile ecosystems of the Arctic are in need of measures to protect the habitats of flora and fauna. The Company strives to respond to changes in Arctic ecosystems in a timely manner while integrating biodiversity conservation into its core business management. In particular, the Arctic LNG 2 project implemented the mitigation hierarchy and no net loss principles.
Integration of the no net loss principle with Arctic LNG 2 as an example. 
In 2022, the Arctic LNG 2 project continued developing and deploying a biodiversity conservation management system compliant with IFC Performance Standard 6 (PS6), Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources. During the year, we finalized a draft strategy to eliminate biodiversity losses (No Net Loss) for natural habitats and drive biodiversity gain (Net Gain) for critical habitats. The Strategy follows the mitigation hierarchy outlined in IFC PS6 and can be represented as seven steps:
The management approach and integration of biodiversity aspects into NOVATEK’s IMS are guided by the Biodiversity Conservation Management standard adopted in 2021. The standard established uniform principles and approaches to biodiversity conservation and impact assessment for the Company’s planned activities.
Companies controlled by PAO NOVATEK develop corporate biodiversity conservation programs in accordance with the guidelines of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of the Russian Federation under the Ecology national project and the Business and Biodiversity initiative.
At NOVATEK Group, biodiversity impact assessment is part of the mandatory environmental impact assessment at the engineering and design stage of Company production facilities.
Assessment results go through several stages of approval at the engineering and design documentation approval stage, including public consultations and environmental expert review. The adequacy and effectiveness of these steps are confirmed by follow-up environmental monitoring in areas potentially affected by the projects.
Biodiversity monitoring. 
The Company strives to implement measures to protect wildlife and rare and vulnerable species, while preventing any fragmentation and degradation of ecosystems. The precautionary principle with respect to the components of biodiversity is implemented through integrated environmental monitoring programs, expanded in geographical scope and thematic content. Annual biodiversity monitoring is one of the most effective ways to assess the status of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems across NOVATEK’s operating areas.
NOVATEK seeks to avoid extracting and processing natural resources in federal-level protected areas while also avoiding operations in areas that are home to valuable and protected plant and animal species. The Company regularly monitors the status of species on the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) found in habitats affected by the Company. The total number of such species recorded in 2022 was more than 110. The vast majority of them are least concern species.
As well as in Arctic LNG 2, the biodiversity conservation programs and plans developed in Yamal LNG meet the requirements of IFC Standard 6.
Our biodiversity conservation planning is guided by the Net Gain principle, which, coupled with the No Net Loss principle, is intended to prevent biodiversity losses and, where necessary, increase biodiversity through compensatory measures.
When conducting ESIA in respect of biodiversity, direct and indirect risks as well as cumulative impact on biodiversity, are evaluated. Special attention is paid to natural ecosystem degradation, introduction of invasive and alien species, overexploitation of natural resources, and the views of local communities directly affected by project activities.
1. Prevent impact. The Company endeavors to rule out environmental impacts wherever possible.
2. Minimize impact. If prevention is not possible, the Company seeks to minimize the impact.
3. Restore. In the event of negative impacts, the Company makes every effort to restore the environment.
4. Offset. If restoration in a particular location is not possible, the Company will offset the damage elsewhere in full.
Mitigation hierarchy applied at Arctic LNG 2 in line with international standards. 
Biodiversity conservation management. 
Biodiversity impact assessment. 
In its efforts to preserve natural ecosystems across all its regions of operation, the Company actively engages with research and environmental organizations.
The biodiversity management system, based on the strict requirements of the IFC Standard 6, covers a wide range of best biodiversity management practices, which, among other are consistent with the LEAP (Locate-Evaluate-AssessPrepare) approach recently proposed by the Nature-related Financial Disclosure (TNFD) Working Group. The Arctic LNG 2 undertakes biodiversity studies across its business locations (L), evaluates biodiversity impact (E), assesses risks and opportunities to improve biodiversity (A), prepares initiatives to mitigate its negative impact on biodiversity, and discloses information to stakeholders (P).
Step 7. Generating new ideas. 
Arctic LNG 2 can potentially share with other projects its experience of using best practices and technologies to launch and deliver the project.

Arctic fox project. 
In 2022, the Company continued the scientific research studies that had been launched in 2019 and were focused on the population of Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) in the operating area of Yamal LNG. The Arctic fox was identified as an indicator species since it is at the top of the food pyramid and, therefore, reflects changes at the lower levels. In addition, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has included the Arctic fox among the ten flagship species, which are designed to show the possible impact of climate change on biota. Species of Least Concern (LC) according to the IUCN.
To check the abundance of Arctic fox, an indicator of breeding activity, i.e. the proportion of breeding dens, was used. The dependent variable is the number of breeding dens (occupied dens) of Arctic fox out of the total number of breeding dens ever recorded (2012–2022). This approach makes it possible to reliably assess the activity of Arctic fox breeding. To predict Arctic fox abundance, the following threshold values were used: for an observed breeding den occupancy rate of 0%–30%, the predicted abundance value was low, for a 30%–50% rate the value was medium (stable), and for a 50%–70% rate high.
From 2019 to 2022, the share of occupied dens fluctuated insignificantly: 38% of the number of dens suitable for breeding were occupied, and in the reporting year the figure increased to 48%. To improve the accuracy of monitoring data, automatic cameras were installed in 17 dens in 2022, in ten of which meetings of foxes or clear signs of their presence were recorded.
Monitoring results indicate that since the construction and commissioning of the facilities of the Yamal LNG Project, the number of Arctic fox has remained stable.
The number of Arctic foxes, among other things, is influenced by the abundance of food resources. The uncontrolled growth of the Arctic fox population, which can be caused by feeding in shift camps, can disrupt the natural balance of the ecosystem. Conscious of the potential negative impacts, Yamal LNG implements a number of measures to mitigate these impacts, such as: • access to food sources is cut off for Arctic foxes; • no domestic animals are allowed; and • an information campaign is run to warn Company employees and subcontractors against feeding wildlife.
The Company implements various measures to compensate for any damage and restore the environment. Impact assessments from existing EIA and ESIA data inform the goals and objectives in this area as well as relevant measures.
Some of the key measures aimed at biodiversity conservation in 2022 include:
South-Tambeyskoye license area. 
The long-tailed duck (Clangula hyemalis) is a species native to the Arctic and Baltic region. It is one of the most populous birds locally but vulnerable on the global scale and was previously selected as an indicator species for wetlands in the South-Tambeyskoye license area. Monitoring conducted in 2022 confirmed its presence and good breeding activity.
Salmanovskiy license area In 2022, new information on biodiversity geography was obtained both for the Salmanovskoye field and for the Gydan Peninsula as a whole. The phototrophic biota of the Northern hypo-Arctic tundra included 94 species of lichen, 142 species of moss, and 192 indigenous vascular plants.
Sabetta seaport In 2022, monitoring to assess the hydrobiocenosis state of the seaport waters was continued. The results of sampling and analyzing bottom sediments and hydrobionts at 20 comprehensive monitoring stations suggest that the measurements are within the limits of multi-year and seasonal fluctuations and are comparable to the historical data and the results of previous studies conducted in seaport waters.
Gulf of Ob In the reporting period, an aerial survey of ice habitats of seals in the spring season was conducted. To obtain updated information on the animals’ movements, satellitelinked radio transmitters were fitted to three ringed seals. The results showed that all marked animals remained in the Gulf of Ob during the period that signals were read from the transmitters (September–October). The studies therefore did not detect any signs that the animals tried to avoid shipping routes.
Shipping along the Northern Sea Route. 
In 2022, vessels shipping along the Northern Sea Route started to report mammal encounters. Between April and December 2022, 37 encounters with animals were recorded by ships at sea, comprising 22 polar bears, 12 pinnipedian mammals, and 3 cetacea. If required, the vessels slow down, stop, or use an alternative route.
Our subsidiaries independently develop biodiversity conservation programs, and key activities implemented in 2022 include:
Activities to restore biodiversity 5 Vulnerable (VU) 5 Near threatened (NT) 90 Least concern (LC) 5 Vulnerable (VU) 5 Near threatened (NT) 90 Least concern (LC)
Proportion of breeding dens at the Sabetta research site %
2021 2020 2019 38 38 38 48 2022. 
Effective partnerships. Measures were implemented under cooperation agreements with the Kronotsky Nature Reserve to conserve the biodiversity of the Kamchatka Territory. In 2022, two thirds of reindeer winter pastures within the nature reserve were monitored. The findings suggest that the wild reindeer population doubled vs. the population estimate made by nature reserve staff in 2020.
In 2022, the Company’s spending on biodiversity restoration were up 35%on the back of growth in spending on releasing fish species. Although, as a whole, the quantity of fry released into rivers was smaller in 2022, the release of valuable fish (salmon) in rivers in 2022 was three times higher than in 2021.

Land reclamation. In 2022, a total of 137 ha of disturbed land was reclaimed, of which 71 ha were returned to agricultural use, 65 ha were turned into forests, and 1 ha was returned to other uses.
Compensatory reforestation. In 2022, reforestation works were mainly carried out in the Noyabrskoye and Nadymskoye forest districts of the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region. The total area of reforestation was 65.7 ha, including 10.7 ha for afforestation.
Emissions. 
Gas and oil production, processing, and refining inevitably result in pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing such emissions is a key focus of the Company’s activities in ensuring environmental protection and boosting environmental performance.
The Company has set a long-term goal to achieve a 20% reduction in air pollutant emission intensity by 2030, down to 0.102 tons per thousand boe, compared to a 2019 baseline.
The NOVATEK Group subsidiaries also regularly monitor pollutant emissions. Approved environmental monitoring programs stipulate yearly measurement of emissions from equipment, including booster compressor stations, gas turbine power plants and furnaces and heaters.
To confirm measurement accuracy, industrial emission monitoring systems at Company facilities are certified by the Federal Information Fund for Ensuring the Uniformity of Measurements.

Other 80 28 65 (1) The increase in sulfur dioxide emissions is due to the commissioning of new facilities at TSNG.
In 2022, a number of measures were implemented to reduce the negative impact on atmospheric air.
• The revamp of a waste incinerator’s heat recovery system was completed to supply heat to the LNG terminal at OOO CryogasVysotsk. This initiative delivered a significant reduction in pollutant and GHG emissions, as boiler plant operation was cut to a minimum.
• With the help of mobile complexes, gas-dynamic and gascondensate studies of wells were carried out without gas emission into the atmosphere.
• An additional low-pressure gas processing line was built at the Yaro-Yakhinskoye oil and gas condensate field.
In the reporting year, as a result of an accident at one of the Company’s production facilities, excess emissions of pollutants were admitted. The Company makes every effort to minimize such incidents and takes extra care to ensure that the risks of emergency emissions are considered at all project development phases.
For more details, see Chapter 5. Safety, p. 108.
Emission intensity tons/thousand boe 2021 2020 0.132 0.143 0.111 2022. 
Compensatory fish stocking. In 2022, compensatory fish stocking was performed in rivers belonging to the Ob-Irtysh (within the Khanty-Mansiysk and Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Regions) and North-Western Fishing Basins. Several subsidiaries were involved in releasing juvenile fish of Siberian sturgeon, salmon, and whitefishes (including muksun and nelma) into water bodies to re-stock commercially important fish species. A total of more than four million juvenile fish were released.
Healthy Tundra Project. 
Since 2019, Yamal LNG has been implementing Healthy Tundra, a unique environmental restoration project to preserve and restore natural tundra ecosystems with due regard to their traditional uses by the indigenous peoples of the Far North. Healthy Tundra was the first pilot environmental restoration project on the Yamal Peninsula. Thanks to the use of local plant species, such as graminaceous plants and willow trees, the risk of introducing invasive species has been eliminated. In 2022, two sections of the tundra were restored as part of the project with the participation of representatives of local nomadic families.
Public recognition of our environmental project. 
A standout project was completed in 2021: the construction of the Cape Kiperport nature trail in the Vyborgsky Nature Reserve. In 2022, the successful project gained public recognition by winning the Ecotourism category at the Ecological Culture: Peace and Accord awards, an international competition held by the V. I. Vernadsky Non-Governmental Ecological Foundation.
Contribution to the conservation of gene pools of ecosystems. 
To conserve the gene pools of plants listed in the Red Data Book of the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region, five species of category 3 plants classified as rare species and four plant species with special concern status were moved from the Salmanovskiy (Utrenniy) license area to green houses at the Avrorin PolarAlpine Botanical Garden-Institute, part of the Kola Science Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences. All 124 clumps of the nine species of perennial herbaceous plants were in good condition at the time of planting.
Support for scientific research studies in Kamchatka. 
For the first time since the 1990s, employees of the Kronotsky Nature Reserve, through support from PAO NOVATEK, launched sea otter counts on the South-Eastern coast of Kamchatka in 2022, with the total length of the route amounting to about 600 kilometers. The monitoring produced up-to-date information on the population of the species, and concentration areas were identified.
In addition to this, in 2022, two projects were launched: • a study of marine mammals near the Shipunsky Peninsula; and • a study of the grey whale feeding group in the near shore waters of the Kronotsky Nature Reserve. Using the data gathered, a photo catalogue of the Kamchatka grey whales was published and two databases were created, which will be populated with information on marine mammals for classification and statistical analysis.
Consultations at Arctic LNG 2. 
In 2022, Arctic LNG 2 held over seven consultations as part of its biodiversity restoration activities. They included meetings with scientific and research institutes and biodiversity experts. Thus, a consultation was held with the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Avrorin Polar-Alpine Botanical Garden-Institute. The meeting discussed methods to develop technologies to reintroduce and acclimatize rare and protected plant species from tundra habitats across the Salmanovskiy (Utrenniy) license area.
On top of this, we held consultations with the Gydan National Park and the Severtsov Institute of Ecology and Evolution of the Russian Academy of Sciences as well as two meetings with a working group on scientific support for designing and implementing biodiversity conservation management programs and action plans in the areas affected by the project, along with other consultations.
In 2022, gross emissions totaled 70.8 thousand tons, down 14% year-onyear, with air pollutant emission intensity down 16% compared to 2021, at 0.11 tons per thousand boe. The decrease in emission volumes was mainly driven by reduced flaring and the Comprehensive Environmental Program.
The Company does not emit highly toxic or ozonedepleting substances.

Waste movement in 2022 tons. 
Waste. 
Drilling waste accounts for the bulk of the waste inevitably generated in mining operations. In waste disposal, NOVATEK pays particular attention to the safe temporary storage of waste to prevent potential threats to the fragile ecosystem of the North.
The Company has set a target to increase the share of waste directed to utilization and treatment to 90% by 2030 from a 2019 baseline. In 2022, the Company utilized and treated 95% of its waste (up 12 p.p. year-on-year due to an increase in the disposal of drilling mud).
One of the key initiatives for managing very highly hazardous waste in 2022 included replacing mercury-containing equipment (mercury-vapor lamps, floodlights, and fluorescent tubes) with LED equipment.
NOVATEK manages waste throughout its life cycle, from providing safe temporary storage of waste-to-waste treatment, landfilling, or utilization. The Company takes a resource-based view of waste management, seeking ways to reuse waste, whenever possible, in manufacturing and business activities by finding consumers that can recycle Company waste.
Waste generation. 
In 2022, the Company generated 91.1 thousand tons of waste, up 70% year-on-year. The share of very highly hazardous and highly hazardous waste (Classes 1 and 2) was insignificant (below 0.1%). The bulk of waste was low-hazard or practically non-hazardous (mainly drill cuttings).
The increase in waste was due to an increase in drill cuttings to 74,873 tons (41,421 tons in 2021) as a result of drilling new, deeper wells at the Yamal LNG project, with the number of completed wells doubled to 25 (13 in 2021).

Waste management. 
The Company does not transport, import, export, or treat waste deemed hazardous under the terms of the Basel Convention Annexes I, II, III, and VIII, and does not ship such waste internationally.
Hazardous waste is sent for utilization/treatment to contractors that specialize in handling and treating such waste and have all the necessary permits.
The bulk of non-hazardous waste was also utilized or treated. In 2022, total non-hazardous waste utilization grew 75% to 85,834 tons amid an increase in waste from operations. Landfilling was significantly reduced in 2022: only 628 tons of waste were landfilled on Company grounds, and 488 tons of waste were landfilled outside Company grounds by licensed contractors. We have a separate waste collection, accumulation, and disposal system deployed across operations.
To reduce the impact of drilling waste on the environment, drilling mud is utilized by using thermal desorption and other physical and mechanical methods found to be acceptable by state environmental review. Including carryovers from prior periods, a total of 79,911 tons of drill cuttings were directed to utilization.
Our waste management efforts contributed to a 64% reduction in waste to 2,850 tons at 2022-end.
For more details, see Appendix 5, Key Environmental Performance Indicators, p. 161.
(1) Waste is categorized into hazardous and non-hazardous waste depending on its hazard class, i.e. waste of Hazard Classes 1 and 2 are categorized as hazardous, while waste of Classes 3–5 are non-hazardous.
(2) Non-hazardous waste utilization saw a significant rise due to an increase in recycling outside the Company’s grounds.
Along with managing waste responsibly, the Company fosters an environmental culture among its employees and local communities. For example, in 2022, the Company took part in environmental charity events, with a number of NOVATEK subsidiaries and joint venture supporting the Green Spring 2022 environmental cleanup day organized by the V.I. Vernadsky NonGovernmental Ecological Foundation. Another important environmental awareness highlight was our employees volunteering on the removal of an illegal dump on Marra Island (Olgin Island), located approximately at the 95th km of the Taz River.

Water Resources. 
NOVATEK is aware of its obligations regarding responsible water management and sets goals for sustainable water use and effective wastewater treatment in accordance with Russian regulations.
Water quantity and quality monitoring is a key focus area of our integrated management system. The main sources of water are surface water and groundwater.
Nevertheless, the Company takes a phased approach to responsible water consumption, which is part of its environmental protection policy.
(1) According to the International Water Management Institute and World Resources Institute’s Water Risk Atlas tool, Russia is a region with abundant water resources.
(2) The baseline water stress level measures the ratio of total water withdrawal to available renewable surface and groundwater supplies.
Assessment of our impact on water resources. 
Assessment of the potential impact on water resources is carried out at the project documentation development stage with the involvement of specialized organizations and includes risks associated with the withdrawal of natural waters, pollution of natural waters, and changes in the hydrological regime of the Company’s area of operations. In relation to each risk, measures have been developed to minimize the impact, based on which plans for water protection measures are being developed.
Ensuring water quality. 
In the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region and the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Region, the NOVATEK Group subsidiaries use their own water treatment facilities to treat water without recourse to urban and municipal facilities.
The Company’s environmental impact on water resources is monitored on an annual basis.
Water quality complies with the established requirements.
Providing access to water bodies. 
Access to water bodies within the areas affected by the Company operations is provided in strict compliance with national legislation to avoid the risk of water scarcity for local communities.
Recirculating water supply. 
The Company carries out a range of measures to ensure sustainable water use. Formation water is also used for reservoir pressure maintenance, reducing external water withdrawal and wastewater discharge.
Recirculating water supply system at OOO CryogasVysotsk’s production site. 
The facility has in place a recycling water supply system. Following preliminary treatment, sewage, storm, and industrial wastewater undergoes desalination and is then used in production processes. In 2022, water reuse totaled 3.81 thousand cubic meters, or 18% of the enterprise’s total water withdrawal and twice as high as in 2021.
The Company also has a snow melting plant running on natural gas (with a melting capacity of 10 cubic meters per hour). The plant is used to melt snow collected from the production site, with subsequent removal of melt water to treatment facilities, which is then fed into the recirculating water supply system.
It is mandatory for all subsidiaries withdrawing water from surface water bodies to develop water management, water body protection, and aquatic biological resource and habitat conservation plans. Several NOVATEK Group subsidiaries have also developed water management plans based on international standards. Since 2021, an environmental management plan has been in place for water resource management at Arctic LNG 2 during the construction phase. The plan describes specific activities to manage, mitigate, and monitor impacts.
The Company keeps primary records of consumed and discharged water, and the compliance of withdrawal and discharge volumes with water rights as well as the laws and regulations on water body protection is verified through audits by authorized state regulators at intervals depending on each operation’s risk-based environmental footprint ranking.
NOVATEK subsidiaries regularly monitor the hydrological and hydrochemical parameters of the water in water use locations, including the areas where pipelines cross water bodies.
NOVATEK’s enterprises have accredited chemical laboratories fully equipped for full and prompt analysis.

Water discharge. 
All wastewater from stationary facilities undergoes primary treatment before any discharge, including flaring and injection.
NOVATEK’s own laboratories and third-party specialized laboratories monitor compliance with established standards as part of environmental operational control and in line with statutory requirements.
Industrial wastewater is sent to treatment facilities and treated mechanically, biologically, physically, and chemically as well as with membranes.
In 2022, the Company’s total water discharge (excluding water injected for pressure maintenance) stood at 2,509 thousand cubic meters, flat year-on-year. All wastewater discharged into surface water bodies qualifies as treated to standard quality and as fresh in terms of salinity. A total of 752 thousand cubic meters of wastewater treated to standard quality were discharged into surface water bodies. A total of 663 thousand cubic meters of wastewater were discharged into the sea. The permissible impact limits in terms of salinity established for seawater are observed when discharging wastewater into the sea. The Company does not discharge hydrocarbon contaminated water into water bodies.
In 2022, the Company recorded two cases of non-compliance with the applicable requirements for wastewater management (with one resulting in fines) and a single above-limit charge for pollutant discharges to water bodies (RR 602 thousand).

For more details, see Appendix 5. Key Environmental Performance Indicators, p. 161.
Water withdrawal. 
In 2022, total water withdrawal by the Company across its footprint decreased slightly year-on-year to 2,923 thousand cubic meters (excluding produced water reinjected for pressure maintenance).
Most water was used for drinking and utility needs.
Specific water withdrawal by production subsidiaries was 2.33 cubic meters per thousand boe (3.61 in 2021). The decrease was due to the transfer of water supply and water discharge facilities from Arctic LNG 2 to OOO NOVATEK-Energo, resulting in redistribution of water withdrawal and discharge between the two assets. Specific water withdrawal by processing subsidiaries was 0.01 cubic meters per ton of production.
Surface water and groundwater are the main sources of water, accounting for 71% and 28% of total water withdrawal in 2022, respectively.
Of the total volume of withdrawn water, 91% was fresh water with a total salinity not exceeding 1,000 mg/l, while 9% was other water. The Company withdraws water within the established limits and without significant impact on water bodies.
In 2022, produced water totaled 7,579 thousand tons, including water from production wells (5,993 thousand tons) and water wells (1,586 thousand tons). A total of 4,776 thousand tons of water were injected into wells for pressure maintenance. The proportion of discharged water was 37%, while the proportion of re-injected water was 63%, flat year-on-year.

When analyzing the effectiveness of the occupational health management system, the Company’s management: • evaluates the overall strategy of the occupational health management system and its effectiveness; • determines the need for specialized corporate documents; • determines the necessary procedure for improving the effectiveness of the management system; and • assesses progress toward goals.
On top of this, PAO NOVATEK has set up a Tyumen-based Operational Control Unit to respond faster, follow up on compliance with occupational health requirements, reduce the risk of work-related injuries, and conduct independent investigations of incidents.
Safety culture. 
NOVATEK builds and promotes a strong safety culture and engages employees and managers at all levels, as well as contractor employees, in reducing operational risks.
Safety culture is integrated across all phases of our production cycle and comprises a range of activities, including: • conducting internal investigations of each incident, including mandatory recording of minor injuries, and adopting a methodology to identify the root causes of each incident; • implementing Life Saving Rules to protect the lives and health of employees, reduce the rate of work-related injuries, comply with regulatory requirements, and ensure decent work; • assessing contractors’ compliance with OHS requirements; • training of all operational staff in occupational safety principles; and • implementing the risk assessment procedure.
Working conditions and OHS matters are included in collective bargaining agreements regulating labor relations through trade union committees. Among other things, to reinforce the safety culture and increase employee engagement in OHS management, the Company holds town hall meetings that bring together management and employees to discuss occupational health and measures to improve working conditions.

System for assessing risks of accidents, incidents, and emergencies. 
Accidents and incidents. 
Alongside preventive measures, the Company develops emergency response plans. For instance, the plan at Yamal LNG includes scenarios and actions to be taken by employees, starting from senior management and professional emergency response and rescue teams to security companies and contractors. Moreover, all projects must initially include provisions that cover measures to minimize or prevent emergency emissions, fires, spills, and other emergencies by various safety systems such as emergency protection, automatic fire suppression, and gas detection systems.
Accident and incident prevention measures. 
Emergency prevention and response action plans are in place at all NOVATEK facilities. In addition, the Company has the following emergency preparedness and response procedures: • emergency containment and management plans; • oil spill response plans; and • firefighting plans and information cards.
At least once every three years, comprehensive emergency training exercises are held to confirm that operators are prepared to contain and respond to an oil or petroleum product spill of the maximum estimated volume.
The Company interacts with local authorities on emergency response issues. For the prompt transmission of information in the event of a threat or emergencies, NOVATEK facilities have approved control, warning and communication schemes. Information is promptly transmitted to the unified duty and dispatch services of local governments, which in turn inform the local population.
In accordance with Russian and international standards, the Company assesses health and safety risks at all stages of project implementation. Risk analysis is carried out during project activities and at the design, operation, and decommissioning stages. Prior to launching the Yamal LNG and Arctic LNG 2 projects, an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) was conducted, considering the full range of potential impacts, including on industrial safety. NOVATEK has in place a Risk Map and a procedure for identifying and assessing hazards and risks as well as environmental and social aspects.
The risk assessment process involves Company employees, including blue-collar employees.
Industrial safety management systems and industrial safety declarations have been developed for Class 1 and 2 hazardous industrial facilities.
In the reporting year, the Company experienced two accidents: 1. In April 2022, depressurization of a wellhead at the Urengoy oil and gas condensate field occurred at AO Arcticgas without fire. The cause was hydraulic shock in the flare line.
2. In September 2022, OOO NOVATEK-Tarkosaleneftegas had an accident at a hazardous production facility caused by operation of defective wellhead equipment.
Both cases were investigated, with measures taken to contain and manage the emergency.
To prevent similar work-related accidents, a set of measures were introduced following the investigations, including: • verifying compliance with the process mode, timing, and completeness of equipment maintenance and repair as well as checking the operation of the automatic process control system for compliance with the approved design solutions; and • conducting drills following potential emergency scenarios, training responsible persons in hazardous work procedures, and testing their knowledge.

Fire safety Operational control. 
Operational control at the Company’s hazardous production facilities is provided by standing commissions.
In 2022, the commissions of subsidiaries and affiliated companies conducted a total of 722 audits for compliance with industrial safety requirements. Additionally, NOVATEK’s commission continued auditing controlled entities for compliance with occupational health, industrial, fire, and environmental safety requirements. In the reporting year, two integrated audits and 18 targeted audits were conducted. Based on the findings of each inspection, relevant reports were produced, and remedial measures were developed.
Pipeline integrity. 
Although its pipelines are relatively new, NOVATEK consistently takes measures to mitigate the risk of pipeline accidents.
The Company analyzes the risks, considering corrosion, wear, subsidence of pipelines and other factors that can lead to accidents. Moreover, the Company maintains liability insurance for the operation of all pipelines. The insurance covers damage caused by an accident at a hazardous facility (damage to third parties) and the risk of environmental damage from accidents.
To ensure the safe operation of its pipelines, NOVATEK takes a number of preventive measures, including the use of special corrosion-resistant pipeline solutions and leak detectors. The Company also regularly conducts integrated in-line diagnostics; found defects are immediately eliminated. For instance, corrosion and erosion wear marks were detected on a pipeline at the Urengoyskoye field in 2022, resulting in a decision to carry out a pipeline retrofit.
Employee initiatives. 
The Company engages employees in industrial safety activities, providing them an opportunity to bring forward and implement their own initiatives. As part of the Innovator corporate program, eight employee ideas were implemented to increase equipment reliability and improve the occupational safety education and training process.
For more details on the Innovator program, see the Innovation section, p. 50.

100% of protected facilities are equipped with automatic fire detection, alarm, and extinguishing systems. 
These measures ensure the pipelines operate reliably and minimize the number of failures. Thanks to the Company’s efficient and reliable pipeline operation and integrity management system, there were no spills in 2022.
The average service life of NOVATEK’s pipelines is 12 years, which is substantially less than the maximum allowable statutory service life of 20 to 30 years 114/115 Safety PAO NOVATEK Sustainability Report 2022 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08


In accordance with its license obligations, NOVATEK is fully responsible for suspending and abandoning wells that have reached the end of their lives as well as those that are plugged and abandoned for geological, environmental, or other reasons. The obligations include well plugging and abandonment (P&A) upon completion of production, equipment removal, land reclamation, and other related activities. As of 31 December 2022, the Group’s asset abandonment liabilities were RR 3.1 billion.
Well suspension or abandonment is always followed by monitoring to minimize risks of blowouts and spills.
Well suspension and abandonment. 
Drilling safety. 
Design documentation for the construction of wells is developed in strict accordance with technical regulations and standards effective in Russia. Only qualified contractors are allowed to perform well interventions. A competitive procedure is used to select drilling contractors, which includes, among other things, an evaluation of their ability to ensure industrial, environmental, and fire safety as well as occupational health.
NOVATEK also adheres to international best practices for offshore well management. Coastal operations follow the principle of delineating responsibility. The operator, the Scientific and Technical Center, and the corporate center each have a responsible employee appointed for each well.
Construction, logging, and testing of any well are accompanied by continuous monitoring of all key parameters with advanced technology and software, both directly on the rig and remotely.
For more details, see PAO NOVATEK’s Sustainability Report 2021, p. 95.
Occupational health and safety at contractors’ facilities. 
In 2022, the Company did not engage in any offshore drilling or development.
For more details on supplier occupational health, see the Supply Chain section, p. 54.
NOVATEK monitors compliance with OHS standards by contractors engaged at its production facilities. The Company’s occupational health and safety management system covers both its employees and contractors. Compliance with OHS requirements forms an integral part of agreements with contractors.
NOVATEK has in place a Contractor Access System. Its key elements include a system to check the level of training of, and issue certificates to, employees at the pre-qualification audit phase as well as pre-qualification requirements for assessing contractors’ occupational health and safety services, including the availability of all necessary documentation, equipment of an appropriate quality, employee training, and timely implementation of all necessary occupational health audits.
Contractors are obliged to participate in OHS incident response plans through their contracts. During emergency drills for employees, contractor employees also participate in the actions designated by emergency containment and management plans.
NOVATEK conducts annual qualification audits to improve work quality and monitor compliance with all OHS requirements.
Contractors who do not meet these requirements are not allowed to progress to the qualification phase.
Spill prevention. 
NOVATEK takes all possible preventive measures to avoid spills and also develops spill response plans as part of its risk management. Significant spills, for which response procedures are developed, are determined based on the requirements of applicable laws and regulations of the Russian Federation. The maximum estimated volume of oil and petroleum product spills is 0.5 tons or more for water bodies, and 3 tons or more on land.
When developing oil spill response plans, forecast areas of oil and petroleum product spills are determined (subject to design spill prevention solutions), including a description of the possible nature of the environmental impact and impact on local communities. The Company also calculates whether its own and/ or third-party emergency rescue services and/or teams are sufficient for handling the maximum estimated volume of spills. Once every three years, the Company conducts comprehensive spill localization and response drills, involving government authorities.
No significant spills were identified in 2022.
The Company’s production facilities operate registration systems for contractor employees. Specifically, a remote access control system has been installed at all Yamal LNG facilities; both Yamal LNG and contractor employees access the premises using a personal pass, with the system logging each entry and exit. Contractor employees are also entered in the register of construction, commissioning, and operating area passes as well as in the induction briefing logbook.

Preventing Work-Related Injuries. 
Work-related injury prevention system. 
The Company’s professional risk assessment is focused on: • identifying potential risk factors (hazards); • determining the scale and causes of hazards; • assessing their potential impacts; and • developing measures to prevent accidents and injuries.
Hazard identification includes detection, recognition, and description, including their sources, triggers, and potential impacts. The identification process is implemented when monitoring occupational health status as part of mandatory investigations of accidents and no lost time injuries. The Company considers employees’ suggestions for identifying potential work-related health and/or injury hazards at their workplaces. We promote risk awareness among our employees and design risk management initiatives, including for risk prevention and mitigation.
All new operations and projects undergo occupational health and safety risk assessments. In particular, the environmental and social impact assessments for the Yamal LNG and Arctic LNG 2 projects focus on acclimatizing and adapting employees to the harsh climate and remote location as well as possible impacts to employee health, performance, and mental health and wellbeing.
All incidents are recorded in a timely manner. Each accident involving employee exposure to work-related health and/or injury hazards is followed by an unscheduled special assessment of working conditions.
In addition to statutory requirements, the Company applies its Incident Root Cause Analysis Standard to internal investigations of incidents. The analysis includes five steps, from recording the circumstances and collecting data to drafting a plan of corrective actions. The main purpose of an internal investigation is to enable a comprehensive review of the events preceding an incident and the implementation of corrective actions to prevent future incidents.
The Occupational Health Management System operates as part of the Integrated OHS Management System. Its primary objective is transition from responding to incidents to managing and preventing risks.
The Company implements a range of measures to eliminate or reduce harmful impacts at workplaces with harmful working conditions and offers compensation and benefits to employees operating in such conditions. NOVATEK enterprises organize screening and regular medical examinations to quickly detect contraindications and warning signs of occupational diseases.

NOVATEK identifies hazards and assesses injury risks to meet the requirements of. 
ISO 45001 and applicable Russian laws. 
Despite our highly developed work-related injury prevention system, there was one fatal accident at a Company facility in 2022. During a break, an employee suddenly felt sick, lost consciousness and fell, suffering a head injury as a result. The employee was immediately given first aid and taken to a healthcare facility. Unfortunately, the employee’s condition worsened, and he was operated on, but he died without regaining consciousness.
Based on the causes established, areas for enhancing the OHS management system were identified. To prevent similar incidents, the Company has implemented a range of additional preventive measures across its production sites. In a number of cases, a decision was made to abandon the further performance of high-risk work in connection with the identification of risks that contribute to the occurrence of incidents.
NOVATEK also keeps records of workrelated injuries at contractors’ facilities, including accidents without lost time. In 2022, contractors recorded a total of 89 work-related accidents, three of which resulted in fatalities.

Diversity matters, along with other aspects of the HR policy, are included in the agenda of meetings of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee of the Board of Directors.
Diversity and Inclusion. 
When recruiting, hiring, training, establishing job duties, wages, and promotions, the Company considers the qualifications, performance, skills, and experience of each person and adheres to the equal opportunity principle, without any bias.
Discrimination-related incidents are tracked within the Company through grievance mechanisms (such as an anonymity hotline, for example).
For more details on grievance mechanisms, see the Ethics section, p. 44.
Gender equality. 
The Company values diversity of opinion and experience among our employees, as outlined in NOVATEK’s Human Rights Policy. The Company does not tolerate any kind of discrimination, whether based on gender, race, religion, physical abilities, or political affiliation.
Firstly, the nature of the Company’s operations in the severe climatic conditions of the Russian Far North involves a workforce comprised mainly of men.
Secondly, Russian labor laws restrict women’s ability to work in severe climatic conditions.
The gender breakdown at the Company is influenced by two key factors.
In 2022, the share of women in the Company’s headcount remained at 22%, including 20% among senior executives and 22% among the Board directors (upon election).
At the same time, the Company maintains a gender balance wherever possible: for example, at our marketing subsidiaries, the proportion of women employed is 48%. In 2022, the proportion of women among new hires increased to 22% (20% in 2021). In addition, we pay attention to the professional development of women already employed by the Company. For example, the proportion of women who took part in the Steps in Discovering Talents program for young specialists was 38%, with 19 average training hours, up 45% year-on-year.
At NOVATEK, wage rates for women and men are based on equal pay structures. Women working at the Company have the same opportunities for development and career advancement as men.
Hired graduates participate in Steps in Discovering Talents, a twoyear program for onboarding young talent and helping them develop professionally through on-the-job adaptation and development. In 2022, 87 young specialists participated in the program.
A mentor is assigned to each young specialist participating in the program, who helps onboard their newer colleague during their first year of employment with the Company. In addition, an Individual Development Plan is drafted up for each program participant for the year ahead, including monthly working meetings to discuss goals and objectives, and progress toward them as well as to offer feedback. Young specialists can also submit feedback and suggestions either to their mentor or directly to the HR Department’s program supervisors. The priority goal of the process is to provide employees with an opportunity to give the most objective evaluation of their satisfaction with various aspects of daily life, such as organization of day-to-day operations, salary, career advancement opportunities, team climate, relations with management, etc.
Young specialists with a high final program score and documented proof of outstanding professional performance can be recommended for the talent pool.
People with disabilities are employed in the Kostroma, Chelyabinsk, Tyumen, Leningrad, and Moscow Regions as well as in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region, comprising 0.17% to 3.14% of the headcount, depending on the region.
The Company guarantees such employees extended paid vacations and paid leave to undergo medical examinations. Employees who have appropriate recommendations in their individual rehabilitation plans are entitled to shorter working hours with full pay and no overtime obligations.
Inclusion. 
As an employer of 107 PEOPLE with disabilities, we cooperate with regional employment centers and centers for people with special needs, which recruit candidates even in remote regions. 
Age diversity. 
For more details on engaging gifted students, see the Key Community Support Projects section, p. 140.
The Company has initiatives in place to ensure a diverse workforce, including age diversity. Thanks to implemented programs, the proportion of young specialists among new employee hires rose to 20% in 2022 (19% in 2021).
To attract and retain young talent, the Company implements a range of measures, from school student engagement programs to mentoring at universities and on-the-job training.
Younger employees (under 30) account for 9% of the workforce 126/127 Employees PAO NOVATEK Sustainability Report 2022 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08


The Company also has employment programs for the indigenous peoples of the Far North. For example, the Company has in place the Regulations on Hiring Members of Indigenous Peoples of the Far North for the Yamal LNG project and the Local Hiring Policy for the Arctic LNG 2 project.
In 2022, Yamal LNG hired eight part-time employees from the nomadic population to help with the Healthy Tundra project restoring disturbed land.
Grievance mechanisms enable employees to raise any concerns without fear of retaliation and ensure that appropriate action is taken.
When sourcing its workforce, NOVATEK prioritizes local hires, while also promoting regional education and minimizing talent sourcing costs.
Hiring and exit. 
Being a constantly developing and fast-growing company, NOVATEK has grown its headcount by more than 60% over the past five years. In 2022, the Company hired 2,617 employees, up 22% year-on-year. The Company supports job rotation by providing employees with relocation opportunities. In 2022, 458 people took advantage of this opportunity.
To attract top talent in today’s market, NOVATEK continuously improves its procedures for recruiting highly skilled employees.
(1) In the total number of staff.
(2) In the total number of top managers.
(3) Top Manager — General Directors, Deputy General Directors of subsidiaries and affiliates of the NOVATEK Group, members of the Management Board and Directors of departments of PAO NOVATEK. The graph shows the regions of the Company’s activity in which 85% of NOVATEK’s employees are employed.

For more details on supporting the indigenous peoples of the Far North, see the Key Community Support Projects section, p. 140.
For more details on remuneration, see the Motivation and Remuneration System subsection, p. 130.
In some cases, particularly when sourcing and staffing for subsidiary projects, NOVATEK engages recruitment agencies. When selecting and hiring candidates referred by recruitment agencies, the Company fully observes their human rights and freedoms, labor law, the provisions of its collective bargaining agreement as well as the terms of the employment contract, which excludes any related risks. The Company favors internal candidates for open roles to expand career and professional growth opportunities for its people.
The Company has in place a system allowing its employees to contact management, communicate their concerns, and receive feedback on their review and solution. Employee reports are discussed at meetings of subsidiary and affiliates heads with PAO NOVATEK’s Chairman of the Management Board. The Company also holds regular town hall meetings, which bring together employees and management. Close communication between employees and management enables the Company to understand employees’ current needs and respectively adjust its social policy. For instance, in response to employee concerns about rising inflation and falling real income in 2022, the Company made two unscheduled cost-of-living increases in addition to the planned indexation to the inflation rate.

Local hiring. 
The proportion of local(4) residents employed by the Company’s subsidiaries varies from region to region.
For example, in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region, where 59% of the Company’s workforce is concentrated, the proportion of local residents in 2022 was 29%, due to the low population density of the region, while in the Chelyabinsk Region, offering a larger pool of candidates, local residents hold 97% of jobs.
In particular, the Company focuses on closing vacancies faster using advanced recruitment solutions, such as the E-Staff internal database, which is constantly updated, and relevant recruiting resources as well as headhunting and recommendations. Currently, the average time to fill a position is 100 days.
NOVATEK offers job security, striving to minimize forced exits. Downsizing becomes an option only when all possible prevention measures have been exhausted. When selecting among employees with equal productivity performance and qualifications during downsizing or job elimination, preference is given to retaining those who have worked for the Company for more than 10 years as well as single mothers and fathers raising children under 18. Employees who have been given notice eight weeks before their dismissal are provided one day a week (paid at their average pay rate) to look for another job.
Matters related to HR management are reviewed by the Board of Directors and the Remuneration and Nomination Committee on an annual basis.
For more details, see the Human Rights section p. 24 and the Ethics section, p. 44.
Trade union relations and collective bargaining agreements. 
NOVATEK regularly monitors changes in the labor market and boosts social support for its employees. In 2021, NOVATEK and its subsidiaries signed collective bargaining agreements for 2022–2024, which provided for indexing retirement benefits, one-off vacation payments, monthly social benefits for retired employees, and much more throughout the reporting year. Collective bargaining agreements cover 90% of Company employees.
Collective bargaining agreements regulate the Company’s engagement with employees on all key labor matters. In particular, collective bargaining agreements at the NOVATEK Group stipulate various working hours. Upon agreement with the employer, employees can opt for shorter hours, a shorter workweek, or flexible work schedules. Long periods of leave, in particular maternity leaves and parental leaves (until the child reaches the age of three), are granted to employees in accordance with the Labor Code of Russia.
For more details on parental leave statistics, see Appendix 4. Personnel Structure, p. 156.

In addition, trade unions represent the interests of employees to the Company’s management by communicating their urgent needs identified through close interaction.
Employee rights to associate, including forming and joining trade unions to protect their labor rights, freedoms, and legitimate interests, are also set out in collective bargaining agreements. The Company actively supports trade unions, spending RR 6.8 million on them in 2022. A total of 62.8% of NOVATEK employees are trade union members. With such a responsible attitude to its employees, the Company saw no cases of labor disputes or strikes in 2022.
Employee remuneration is determined in a manner providing for a reasonable and justified ratio of fixed and variable parts, the latter depending on the Company’s performance and the employee’s personal (individual) contribution. Compensation and benefits packages offered by the Company are also an important part of the remuneration system. The variable part of remuneration payable to Management Board members and other key employees uses KPIs aligned with the Company’s strategic goals.
The minimum wage of NOVATEK employees across the Company's regions of operation is traditionally almost twice as high as the local minimum wage. In addition, NOVATEK performs salary indexation on a regular basis in line with its collective bargaining agreement.
In 2022, the Company made one scheduled and two unscheduled cost-of-living increases, and the average salary (excluding top management) was.

The Company seeks to increase employee engagement in its operations by encouraging efficiency and optimization proposals. For several years now, NOVATEK has been running the Innovator program, under which every employee can not only put forward a business improvement initiative but also be rewarded for it.
For more details on the Innovator program, see the Innovation section, p. 50.
Social programs for employees. 
Striving to build long-term partnerships with its workforce, NOVATEK runs a range of social programs described in the collective bargaining agreement and aimed at supporting employees.

Management Approach. 
Contribution to Regional Development. 
NOVATEK builds trust-based relationships and tailors its social policy to the interests of stakeholders to ensure that the Company’s support is targeted and reduces the exposure to social risks.
Given the economic uncertainty in the reporting year, the Company increased its external social expenses, having allocated RR 3.3 billion for these purposes, up 2.5% year-on-year.
These expenses include infrastructure investments, the costs of supporting the indigenous peoples of the Far North (9% of the total) and healthcare institutions, charity projects, sports, culture, and educational programs. The bulk of the funds was allocated to projects in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region; however, the Company also finances social projects in the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Region, Tyumen, Chelyabinsk, Leningrad, Murmansk, and Kostroma Regions as well as the Kamchatka Region.
External social expenses(1)
RR bln (1) Shown in the Social Expenses and Compensatory Payments lines of the consolidated statement of profit or loss in the IFRS consolidated financial statements. Beginning with the 2022 Report, this includes interests in joint ventures pro rata to their stake. Figures for 2021 and 2020 have been recalculated.
An investment program driven by engagement with local communities. 
When planning social activities in its regions of operation, NOVATEK analyzes the current situation and identifies vital areas in need of financing through communication with stakeholders. Engagement with local communities takes place primarily through direct consultations, community monitoring, and obtaining feedback from local residents. In addition, the Company regularly engages with local governments, municipal administrations, and non-profits that represent the interests of various stakeholder groups. An integral part of the Company’s social policy is the regular assessment of the impact and effectiveness of social investments.
Supporting local communities is an important element of the Company’s corporate social responsibility. NOVATEK promotes community development through social and economic partnerships, taxes, and job creation.
Regular and active stakeholder engagement through various mechanisms maximizes the focus and impact of our social policy. Amid the turbulence of 2022, the Company continued to support its regions of operation as this support became even more relevant to local residents.
At the Board of Directors level, matters related to external social policy are addressed by the Remuneration and Nomination Committee. In particular, the Committee annually reviews the Report on PAO NOVATEK’s Social and Charitable Activities in the Regions of Operation. At the executive body level, a Deputy Chairman of the Management Board is responsible for engagement with local communities. At the business unit level, designated officers are responsible for stakeholder engagement.
Cooperation with the indigenous peoples of the Far North. 
NOVATEK respects the interests, culture, customs, and values of local communities, paying particular attention to protecting the rights and preserving the cultural heritage and traditional ways of life of the indigenous peoples of the Far North in its regions of operation, including their right to land and clean and accessible water.
The Company’s approach is based on best international standards and is governed by both its social policy and the Plans to Promote the Sustainable Development of Indigenous Peoples developed at the Yamal LNG and Arctic LNG 2 projects (the “Plans”), considering the views of nomadic families. The Plans outline an approach to engagement with indigenous people, an assessment of the impact of the Company’s projects on indigenous people, measures to expand social and economic opportunities, improvement of ecosystem services, and support for traditional ways of life during and after the construction of project facilities and infrastructure.
In 2022, as part of further efforts to implement the Plans, we started monitoring the effectiveness of implementing Plans to Promote the Sustainable Development and supported the design of social infrastructure facilities, the operation of socially oriented non-profit organizations, and the purchase of vital goods for nomadic reindeer herders.

RR. 
To track the performance of activities under the Plans, independent monitoring and analysis of the effectiveness of measures to engage with the indigenous peoples of the Far North and manage relevant impacts are run on a regular basis, at least once a year. This helps us ensure the most rapid response to all requests and queries and provide material assistance.
When planning economic or other activities in the areas where the indigenous peoples of the Far North traditionally live, the Company holds public consultations as a matter of course and runs a process of seeking free, prior, and informed consent from the indigenous peoples of the Far North to consider their interests.
As part of the EIA procedures, in 2022, 53 public consultations were held on 52 projects of the Company's planned projects in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region, Murmansk and Leningrad Regions, which is 23% higher than last year.
Communication on implemented social projects takes place both directly, during the Company’s meetings with representatives of local communities, and through grievance mechanisms in place at NOVATEK and at the Yamal LNG and Arctic LNG 2 projects.
The Company listens carefully to queries and makes every effort to align its social policy with the views and wishes of its stakeholders as far as possible. No conflicts with local residents or cases of forced displacement or human rights violations were recorded in 2022.

Indigenous peoples are always welcome to seek help from the Company. For example, in the reporting year, the Yamal LNG and Arctic LNG 2 project hotlines received a total of 65 queries dealing with matters related to maintaining traditional ways of life. Yamal LNG received 22 queries related mainly to the supply of firewood and fuel, transportation of nomadic reindeer herders and their accommodation at rotation camp dormitories, and the construction of reindeer crossings. Arctic LNG 2 received 43 queries, primarily concerning air transportation, sustainable reindeer herding, and assistance with firewood and food supplies.
A total of RR 283 million was allocated to supporting the indigenous peoples of the Far North in 2022, of which almost 20% dealt directly with the queries mentioned above. The Company supplies indigenous communities with fuel and reindeer forage, buys and delivers foods, and finances tundra monitoring from the air. In 2022, the Company provided funds to purchase diesel generators for communities. Another focus area is participating in organizing and holding events related to ethnic and cultural traditions. The Company annually takes part in traditional festivals of the indigenous peoples, such as Reindeer Herder’s Day, Fisherman’s Day, Indigenous Peoples’ Day, and events commemorating anniversaries and memorable dates of Nenets writers and poets. NOVATEK supports the preservation of cultural heritage sites, implementing Khorei — the Yamal Literary Map project — and supporting activities to preserve the traditional ways of life, culture, and language of the indigenous peoples of the Far North.

The Company seeks to support the indigenous peoples of the Far North and improve their standards of living by supporting traditional crafts and investing in infrastructure as well as by facilitating the employment of their representatives.
For more details on the employment of indigenous people of the Far North, see the Diversity and Inclusion section, p. 126.

The Yamal LNG and Arctic LNG 2 project areas are home to 82 nomadic families, encompassing 430 people engaged in traditional economic activities. Of these, 56 families of reindeer herders follow migration passages and set up temporary nomad camps, while the remaining 26 families live in 17 permanent nomad camps. The families own a total of more than 17 thousand reindeer.
For more details on projects implemented to support the indigenous peoples of the Far North, see Local Community Rights section in PAO NOVATEK’s Sustainability Report 2021.
Quality control of ecosystem services. 
A four-year-long community monitoring program at Yamal LNG, aimed at measuring the satisfaction of nomadic families with the quality of ecosystem services provided to them, was completed in 2022.
The monitoring program was run by surveying reindeer herder families whose herding routes pass through the South-Tambeyskoye license area. The studies confirmed that all traditional use patterns for natural resources had been preserved. Nomadic families continue to engage in reindeer herding, fishing, hunting, and gathering wild crops.
Threshold indicators for the quality of ecosystem services and the quality of life of the indigenous peoples of the Far North are sustainable.

Development of the remote village of Gyda in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region. 
In 2022, further funding was provided to construct dormitories in the Gyda village, Tazovsky District, for 600 boarding school students as part of an initiative launched in 2021. The school building was commissioned in 2018 with Company support.
The boarding school is a three-story building connected to a gym by a heated passage. In addition to classrooms and teachers’ rooms, the building has everything to meet students’ needs: a canteen, a medical facility, wood and metalwork workshops, sewing and cooking rooms, a language laboratory, a reading room, an assembly hall, a museum, and a projection booth. The grounds feature basketball courts, playgrounds for younger students, a learning and gardening plot, and a recreation area.
Development of the Kamchatka Region. 
As part of an initiative to optimize logistics by developing the Northern Sea Route, the Company invests in the development of related infrastructure in Kamchatka. The project includes the construction of a terminal as well as coastal infrastructure facilities and utility systems to ensure the transport security system, state border crossing point, and communication channels all run smoothly. The terminal can then be used to transship LNG for subsequent transportation to Southeast Asia and other regions.
In addition to the direct positive impact on the development of local industry, the project will also have a positive social impact by creating jobs and increasing tax revenues to local budgets (with the funds to be allocated to developing social infrastructure facilities).
Along with the Kamchatka Region, a similar project to build a transshipment facility is being implemented in Murmansk.

Independent Auditor’s Limited Assurance Report. 
To the Management of Joint Stock Company «NOVATEK»: 
Introduction. 
We have been engaged by the Management of Joint Stock Company «NOVATEK» (hereinafter – the “Company”) to provide limited assurance on the selected information described below and included in the Sustainability Report of NOVATEK for 2022 (hereinafter – the “Sustainability Report”). The Sustainability Report represents information related to the Company and its subsidiaries and joint ventures (hereinafter together – the “Group”), unless otherwise stated in the Sustainability Report.
Selected information. 
We assessed the quantitative and qualitative information that is disclosed in the Sustainability Report and referred to or included in the Appendix 6 “Compliance with GRI Standards (GRI content index)” and in the Appendix 7 “Compliance with SASB (SASB content index)” of the Sustainability Report (hereinafter – the “Selected Information”). The Selected Information has been reported in accordance with: • GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (hereinafter – the “GRI Standards”) published by Stichting Global Reporting Initiative; and • Oil & Gas – Exploration & Production Sustainability Accounting Standard (the “SASB Standard”) published by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, respectively.
The scope of our limited assurance procedures was limited to the Selected Information for the year ended 31 December 2022 only. We have not performed any procedures with respect to earlier periods or any other items included in the Sustainability Report and, therefore, do not express any conclusion thereon.
Reporting criteria. 
We assessed the Selected Information using relevant criteria, including reporting principles and requirements, in the GRI Standards and SASB Standard (hereinafter – the “Reporting Criteria”). We believe that the Reporting Criteria are appropriate given the purpose of our limited assurance engagement.
Responsibilities of the Group’s management. 
Management of the Group is responsible for: • designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation of the Selected Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; • establishing internal methodology and guidelines for preparing and reporting the Selected Information in accordance with the Reporting Criteria; • preparing, measuring and reporting of the Selected Information in accordance with the Reporting Criteria; and • the accuracy, completeness and presentation of the Selected Information.
Our responsibilities. 
We are responsible for: • planning and performing the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Selected Information is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; • forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained; and • reporting our conclusion to the Management of the Group.

2. 
This report, including our conclusion, has been prepared solely for the Management of the Group in accordance with the agreement between us, to assist management in reporting on the Group’s sustainability performance and activities. We permit this report to be disclosed in the Sustainability Report, which will be published on the Company’s websitei, to assist management in responding to its governance responsibilities by obtaining an independent auditor’s limited assurance report in connection with the Selected Information. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Management of the Group for our work or this report except where the respective terms are expressly agreed between us in writing and our prior consent in writing is obtained.
Professional standards applied and level of assurance. 
We performed our limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information”, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.
A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks.
Our independence and quality management. 
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour, and the ethical requirements of the Auditor’s Professional Ethics Code and Auditor’s Independence Rules that are relevant to our limited assurance engagement in respect of the Selected Information in the Russian Federation.
Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Work done. 
We are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material misstatement of the Selected Information. In doing so, we: • made enquiries of the Group’s management, including the Group Sustainability Reporting (SR) team and those with responsibility for SR management and the Group SR reporting; • conducted interviews of the Group’s personnel responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Report and collection and analysis of underlying data; • performed analysis of the relevant internal methodology and guidelines, gaining an understanding of the design of the key structures, systems, processes and controls for managing, recording, preparing and reporting the Selected Information; • performed limited substantive testing on a selective basis of the Selected Information to check that data had been appropriately measured, recorded, collated and reported; and • reviewed the Selected Information for compliance of the disclosures with the relevant requirements of the Reporting Criteria.
The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.
 i The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of management; the work carried out by us does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, we accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the reported Selected Information or Reporting Criteria when presented on the Company’s website.
www.tedo.ru 3. 
Reporting and measurement techniques. 
Under the GRI Standards and SASB Standard there is a range of different, but acceptable, reporting and measurement techniques. The techniques can result in materially different reporting outcomes that may affect comparability with other organisations. The Selected Information should therefore be read in conjunction with the methodology used by management in preparing the Sustainability Report, described therein, and for which the Group is solely responsible.
Limited assurance conclusion. 
Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Selected Information for the year ended 31 December 2022 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.

Forward–looking Statements. 
This Report includes ‘forward-looking information’. Certain statements included in this Report, including, without limitation, statements concerning plans, goals, strategies, future events, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are other than statements of historical facts. The words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “forecast,” “project,” “will,” “may,” “should” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Forwardlooking statements include statements regarding: strategies, outlook and growth prospects; future plans and potential for future growth; liquidity, capital resources and capital expenditures; growth in demand for our products; economic outlook and industry trends; developments of our markets; the impact of regulatory initiatives; and the strength of our competitors. The forward-looking statements in this Report are based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including without limitation, management’s examination of historical operating trends, data contained in our records and other data available from third parties. Although we believe that these assumptions were reasonable when made, these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond our control. As a result, we may not achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or projections. In addition, important factors that, in our view, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.
For more details about important factors, see Appendix 1. Key Sustainability Risks and Opportunities, р. 146.
When relying on forward-looking statements, one should carefully consider the foregoing factors and other uncertainties and events, especially in light of the political, economic, social and legal environment in which we operate. Such forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. Accordingly, we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of them, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. We do not make any representation, warranty or prediction that the results anticipated by such forward-looking statements will be achieved, and such forward-looking statements represent, in each case, only one of many possible scenarios and should not be viewed as the most likely or standard scenario. The information and opinions contained in this document are provided as at the date of this review and are subject to change without notice.
