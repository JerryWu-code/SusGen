Sustainability at Fortum. 
The entire energy sector is transforming, and Fortum is an integral part of this change� Climate change is accelerating the need for major structural changes in society� When writing this report, we have seen a war start in Ukraine� As a company with long business ties and broad operations in Russia, we at Fortum are devastated and sad by Russia’s attack on Ukraine� Our management is following the constantly evolving situation with the highest attention.
Sustainability is at the heart of Fortum’s strategy� Fortum is the third largest producer of CO2-free electricity in Europe and a significant gas company. Our scale, competence, and resources enable further growth as we drive the energy transition towards a carbon-neutral economy� A successful transition must balance sustainability, affordability, security of supply, and in light of the current developments, also independence� This requires renewables, but also clean hydrogen, energy storage, and other flexible solutions. As greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced in other sectors besides energy, we provide clean energy and sustainable solutions for our industrial and infrastructure customers.
In addition to climate and resources, we pay close attention to the impacts our operations can have on our personnel, contractors, and the society around us� Fortum has 7,000 colleagues in Russia and the recent developments have been distressing and challenging for all our employees� In this unprecedented situation, our primary focus and concern continues to be the health, safety, and wellbeing of our employees and contractors, and the security of supply of customers in all our operating countries.
With our strategy, we will continue to drive the clean energy transition and deliver sustainable financial performance. We want to drive the change for a cleaner world.

Year 2021 in short. 
Year 2021 was characterised by a deepened cooperation with Uniper in the areas of sustainability, safety, security, health, and the environment. It was also the first full year with Uniper consolidated as a subsidiary of Fortum� We continued to implement our strategy at the heart of which is the transition to clean energy�
The exceptional conditions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic continued in 2021, and Fortum’s top priorities were to ensure the health and safety of its employees and contractors and to maintain business continuity� This goal was well achieved, as there were no interruptions in Fortum’s energy production� Employee wellbeing programmes highlighted topics related to mental energy, resilience, and physical health, and managers were supported in leading employees’ wellbeing� Maintenance outages were also implemented as scheduled, with careful planning and by taking special measures to protect the health of our employees and contractors� Yet, the impact of the pandemic on our corporate ways of working has been substantial� Following the recommendations of local authorities, our office employees worked remotely for most of the year. We have continued to use new digital tools that make collaboration and remote work as smooth as possible� At power plants and other operational sites, where remote work is not possible, we have used special measures to protect the health and safety of our own and our contractors’ employees�
Climate and resources In 2021, we continued to implement our strategy to drive the clean energy transition forward� Fortum’s strategic priority is to transform our own operations to carbon neutral� We have committed to the carbonneutral (Scope 1, 2 and 3) target globally, in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement, by 2050, and in our European generation (Scope 1 and 2) by 2035. In 2021, we set a target to reduce our indirect Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 35% by 2035 at the latest.
Our coal-exit is proceeding well, and within less than one year, we have been able to announce accelerated coal phase-out of six of our coal-fired power plants in Germany and the UK compared to the original timetable and will cease the use of coal in our Russia division by the end of 2022. By 2030, Fortum will phase out or exit about 8 GW of coal-fired power generation. We will also strengthen and grow in CO2-free power generation. Our target is to build 1.5–2 GW of new renewable energy capacity by 2025.
In addition to the climate targets, Fortum had a biodiversity target for 2021, which was achieved by conducting 13 major voluntary measures that improve the living conditions of species and strengthen populations.
Fortum is a significant provider of flexible gas-fired generation and a major trader of gas in Europe� Natural gas is important to enable a reliable and affordable supply of energy in the medium-term, and will be replaced with increasingly green hydrogen and other clean gases over time� Fortum’s strong position in gas creates good prerequisites to succeed in providing green hydrogen solutions in the future�
Personnel and society The safety of own personnel and contractors remains Fortum’s top priority, and in 2021 we launched the Safety Ground Rules to support the improvement of Fortum’s safety performance� Together with Uniper, we also initiated the alignment of several key safety processes, and Uniper was included in the Group’s incident notification system.
On the R&D front, Fortum continued to expand its battery recycling capacity with a major recycling plant investment� We continued to steer support to society and cooperation with local communities through our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme. In 2021, Fortum supported charity organisations in order to help its local communities during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Geopolitical environment in 2022 When writing this report, we have seen a war start in Ukraine� We at Fortum are devastated and sad by Russia’s attack on Ukraine� In the first weeks of March 2022, we have already witnessed what great suffering the war has caused to people. There is no justification for this. The situation is very dynamic and keeps evolving constantly, and our management is following the situation with the highest attention� We have commented on the impacts on our operations, e�g�, in our investor news releases on 3 March and 7 March 2022.
The current developments have also added a new variable to the equation of sustainability, affordability, and security of supply, which is independence� We are actively supporting this through our investments into clean power, increasingly clean gas and flexibility. Amongst all the uncertainty, one thing is absolutely clear: Europe’s urgent need for an energy transition� 5 SUSTAINABILITY AT FORTUM CLIMATE AND RESOURCES PERSONNEL AND SOCIETY APPENDICES SUSTAINABILITY AT FORTUM APPENDICES PERSONNEL AND SOCIETY CLIMATE AND RESOURCES.

Transform our own operations to carbon neutral Fortum focuses on reducing CO2 emissions from its own operations, is committed to carbon neutrality, and aims to drive the clean energy transition. We have committed to the carbon neutral (Scope 1, 2, and 3) target globally, aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, by 2050 at the latest. In 2021, Fortum developed a new target for the reduction of indirect Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions which play a significant role in Fortum’s total GHG emissions. Including the new Scope 3 reduction target, we have the following ambitious mid-term targets: • Reduction of CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2) in European generation by at least 50% by 2030 (compared to base-year 2019) • Carbon neutral (Scope 1 and 2) in European generation by 2035 at the latest • Reduction of Scope 3 indirect GHG emissions by 35% by 2035 at the latest (compared to base-year 2021)
The chart presents Fortum’s coal-fired power generation capacity and its phase-out in Europe� By 2030, Fortum will phase out or exit about 8 GW of coal-fired power generation. Fortum has built a solid track record of its decarbonisation path to reach carbon neutrality while ensuring security of supply also in exceptional times. The coal-exit is proceeding even faster than anticipated: within less than one year, we have been able to announce accelerated coal phase-out of six of our coal-fired power plants in Germany and the UK compared to the original timetable� The chart also presents our CO2 emissions reduction target and our commitment to carbon neutrality in European generation by 2035 at the latest. With these commitments, we aim to transform our own power plants and operations to carbon neutral in Europe� 8 SUSTAINABILITY AT FORTUM CLIMATE AND RESOURCES PERSONNEL AND SOCIETY APPENDICES SUSTAINABILITY AT FORTUM APPENDICES PERSONNEL AND SOCIETY CLIMATE AND RESOURCES.

Decarbonising society Customers are expected to become increasingly active in the digitally interconnected energy system in the future, and industrial customers across different sectors are demanding scalable, competitive solutions to decarbonise their operations and mitigate their environmental impacts� Fortum is responding to this demand by offering4solutions and services for our industrial and infrastructure customers, including those sectors that are challenging to decarbonise, such as the chemicals industry, the steel industry, and international shipping�
In the increasingly diverse and gradually changing energy system, fossil-fuelled generation will be replaced with CO2-free power generation. Fortum aims to build 1.5–2 GW of new renewable electricity capacity by 2025, primarily in Europe. The new energy system requires new flexible energy sources to balance fluctuations, including, e�g�, batteries and other storage solutions, as stable fossilfuelled power generation is replaced with intermittent renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power�
Replacing coal with natural gas in Central European energy production is one possible short-term to medium-term way to reduce CO2 emissions in Europe� Natural gas enables the transition to a low-carbon energy system by enabling the growth of wind and solar power in the system, as well as by acting as fuel or feedstock for the industrial sectors� Fortum’s strong position in the gas business also creates new business opportunities in providing clean gas solutions (e�g� hydrogen) and supporting industries in decarbonising their processes� Transitioning to a low-carbon energy system also enables the decarbonisation of other sectors through the coupling of CO2-free power generation and green hydrogen� Over time, increasingly green hydrogen will replace natural gas by decarbonising hard-to-electrify sectors and will provide flexibility and security of supply for the energy system.
In short, the energy transition and the transition to carbon neutrality rely on clean power and gas (e�g� hydrogen)� Fortum’s strategy is designed to sustain Fortum’s success in a decarbonised society.

Case | Aiming for a corporate culture in which future employees from different backgrounds thrive, develop, and always give their best. 
Fortum was the best among the Finnish listed companies in the European Women on Board (EWoB) Gender Diversity Index, ranking at 22/668. Fortum also had the biggest improvement in gender diversity in top management positions among the Finnish companies. Of all executive positions at Fortum, 44% are currently held by women, while 57% of the members of the Board of Directors and 33% of the members of the Management Team are women.
The EWoB Gender Diversity Index looked at 668 European listed companies in 2021� For the third year in a row, the survey looked at how gender equality is being achieved among the boards, management, and decision-makers of European companies� “Appreciating experts from diverse backgrounds, rewarding performance, and providing equal opportunities for advancement are key principles for us at Fortum� I believe that we are more competitive and better able to meet the expectations of our customers and society when our management is also diverse� In the traditionally male-dominated energy industry, this is not a matter of course; our goal is to build a corporate culture in which our future employees from different backgrounds always feel comfortable, develop, and give their best,” says Markus Rauramo, President and CEO of Fortum�
In the 668 listed companies included in the study, 28% of all the different management positions were held by women� According to the study, gender equality has developed best in countries where it is promoted by law, such as Belgium, France, and Norway� In the Nordic countries, which have traditionally been known for their equality, such as Sweden and Finland, development has almost come to a halt�
The 2021 study included the same 16 Finnish listed companies that were part of the 2020 survey. Of these, 9 had improved and 7 had weakened their results compared to the previous year. 56% of the Finnish companies in the survey exceed the average of the Gender Diversity Index.

Sustainability priorities. 
Sustainability priorities have been defined to support sustainable business. In our operations, we take into consideration climate and resource issues as well as our impacts on personnel and society�
Fortum reassessed its sustainability priorities in 2021. A sustainability materiality analysis was conducted based on internal and external stakeholder surveys, including some 800 respondents, and an extensive desktop review of potential business impact with regard to regulation and expectations of capital markets. The desktop review also included an assessment of peers’ material sustainability aspects and media analysis as well as an analysis of the correlation between the topics and the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs)�
The materiality analysis applied a two-dimensional approach� It considered the sustainability impacts of Fortum’s business activities on a number of sustainability issues as well as the impacts of these issues on Fortum�
The 2021 sustainability priorities for Fortum are presented in the materiality matrix.
Climate change and greenhouse gas emissions.

Sustainability targets affect every Fortum employee Sustainability targets affect every Fortum employee, and safety-related targets are a part of Fortum’s short-term incentive (STI) programme� In addition to the Group-level targets, divisions have their own targets� Fortum’s Board of Directors annually decides on the Group-level sustainability targets to be included in the incentive programme� Realisation of the safety target, Lost Time Injury Frequency (LTIF) for own personnel and contractors, was a part of Fortum’s STI programme in 2021. However, the Board can, at its discretion, also take into consideration in the result other safety-related incidents and especially the number of severe occupational accidents� The target for severe occupational accidents is zero�
In the 2022 STI programme, the safety target contains the severity rate per Total Recordable Injuries (TRI) of own employees and contractors combined and the execution rate of safety leadership training. As in 2021, the Board has the option to take into consideration also other safety incidents� The weight of the target in the incentive programme is 10% (2021: 10%).
Climate-related targets aligned with Fortum’s strategy are a part of. 
Fortum’s long-term incentive (LTI) programme. In the 2022–2024 LTI plan, the target is related to the reduction of absolute CO2 emissions in the European fossil fleet, based on a fossil fleet review addressing the Group’s European generation portfolio and a pathway developed to reach Fortum Group’s 2030 and 2035 climate targets.
Uniper continues to follow its own STI and LTI plans� However, the safety metric (severity rate per TRI) in the STI 2022 programme and the carbon-related metric in the 2022–2024 LTI plan are applicable to both companies. Scaling of the STI/LTI metrics is company-specific.

Energy. 
Fortum’s purpose is to drive the change for a cleaner world� We want to enable the energy transition by providing customers and societies a reliable and affordable supply of low-carbon energy and sustainable solutions� In the future, the energy system – and Fortum’s portfolio – will be based on renewable energy, increasingly clean gas (e�g�, hydrogen), and nuclear power. By improving the energy efficiency of our power and heat production, we can also reduce flue-gas emissions to the environment relative to the produced energy and decrease production costs�
Energy production Fortum’s power generation is mainly based on natural gas-fired generation, and carbon dioxide-free hydro and nuclear power. Fortum targets to rapidly reduce the share of coal in power generation� A minor share of Fortum’s power generation is currently based on solar and wind, but Fortum targets significant growth in the area over the next five years.
Fortum is also a large producer of district heat� The heat is mainly produced at natural gas-fired and energy-efficient combined heat and power (CHP) plants�
In summer 2021, Fortum divested its district heating and cooling businesses in the Baltic countries, where Fortum provided district heating in five cities: Tartu and Pärnu in Estonia, Jelgava and Daugavpils in Latvia, and Klaipeda in Lithuania. In September 2021, Fortum also concluded the sale of its 50% ownership in the Swedish district heating and cooling company Stockholm Exergi.
In July 2021, Fortum sold its coal-fired Argayash CHP plant in Russia.
The plant has a power generation capacity of 256 MW and a heat production capacity of 824 MW. In October 2021, Uniper’s lignite-fired 900-MW Schkopau power plant was sold in Germany.
In 2021, Fortum’s power generation was 188.1 (2020: 142.1) TWh and its heat and steam production 33.4 (2020: 29.6) TWh. 40% of our total power generation was CO2-free. In Europe, 64% of our power generation was CO2-free. The power and heat generation figures also include Fortum’s share in associated companies and joint ventures that sell their production to the owners at cost�

More renewable energy In 2021, we invested in wind and solar power production. In March 2021, Fortum commissioned the 250-MW Jaisalmer solar power plant in Rajasthan State in India. During the last part of 2021, Fortum divested both the 250-MW Pavagada and the 250-MW Jaisalmer solar power plants in India� Fortum’s investments in wind and solar power are mainly done through partnerships (e�g� joint ventures and associates or other forms of cooperation)�
At the end of 2021, Fortum and Uniper announced the investment decision for the construction of the 380-MW wind farm in Närpes and in Kristinestad, Finland. The wind turbines are expected to be fully commissioned in 2024.
The refurbishments of Fortum’s, excluding Uniper, own hydropower plants in Finland and Sweden produced 5 MW of new renewable electricity production capacity in 2021.
New low-carbon production In 2021, the new 25-MW heat pump unit was commissioned at the Suomenoja plant in Espoo, Finland� Fortum will further increase its non-combustion-based heat production in Finland with the 11-MW air-to-water heat pump in Vermo and large-scale air-to-water heat pumps, e.g., in Kera and Otaniemi. Fortum is also developing data centre projects with data centre operators in the Espoo-Kirkkonummi area in Finland. Excess heat from data centres can be utilised in district heating networks� Fortum has set a goal to discontinue the use of coal in Espoo in 2025. The project for carbon neutrality in the 2020s is called4Espoo Clean Heat�
Switch to green hydrogen and other clean gas Uniper has power-to-gas (P2G) pilot sites in Falkenhagen and in Hamburg, Germany� The Falkenhagen wind-to-gas site also uses CO2 captured from a nearby bio-ethanol plant to transform the green hydrogen (H2) into carbon-neutral methane (CH4)� Since natural gas contains mainly methane, green methane has the same chemical properties and, therefore, it can be stored in unlimited quantities in the gas pipeline system�
In early 2021, Uniper announced the plans of large-scale production of green hydrogen at the Maasvlakte power plant in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The aim is to realise a 100-MW hydrogen production capacity at the site by 2025 and to eventually expand the capacity to 500 MW. A final investment decision will be made in 2022.
Uniper has also joined in the Zero Carbon Humber partnership, a project to achieve net zero carbon by 2040 using blue and green hydrogen and CCUS (Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage) solutions in the UK. The gas-fired Killingholme power plant is planned to be used as the site for up to a 700-MW blue hydrogen production capacity, and a 100-MW green hydrogen production capacity. The project for the blue hydrogen facility is scheduled to start in 2022, and production of green hydrogen is estimated to begin in 2025.
Additionally, Uniper and Ørsted have announced a partnership to integrate wind power generation and a 70-MW electrolysis unit, which will be installed on the grounds of the decommissioned coalfired Wilhelmshaven power plant in Germany. The unit is scheduled to begin producing green hydrogen in 2025. Uniper intends to expand Wilhelmshaven units’ production capacity to 410 MW by 2030.

Energy efficiency Improving energy efficiency at power plants refers to measures we implement to increase the efficiency of production processes or reduce the energy consumption of plants or equipment� This enables us to produce more electricity or heat for our customers without increasing fuel consumption and to reduce carbon dioxide and other flue-gas emissions into the environment in relation to the produced energy�
The energy efficiency of power plants can be increased through investments and technical improvements, preventive maintenance, and by training personnel in the optimal operation of the plant and in monitoring the plant’s operating economy� Improving power plant availability also increases energy efficiency, as unplanned plant startups are reduced�
All Fortum’s power plants in Finland are within the scope of the Energy-Efficiency Agreement period 2017–2025 between the Confederation of Finnish Industries and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment of Finland� The participation in this Agreement helps Fortum on focusing in energy efficiency and strengthens its position as an energy-efficiency expert.
Uniper’s gas-fired and coal-fired power plants and gas storage sites in Germany are certified to the ISO 50001 Energy management system standard.
Energy-efficiency investments In fuel-based energy production, Fortum aims to utilise the fuel’s energy as efficiently as possible. We can improve the energy efficiency of fuel use by increasing combined heat and power (CHP) production� In CHP production, up to 90% of the energy content of the fuels can be utilised. The efficiency of separate electricity generation is about 40–60%.
Fortum annually invests in refurbishments and modernisations at several power plants, which improves their energy efficiency and availability. In 2021, Fortum’s, excluding Uniper, combined energy savings of the energy-efficiency improvement projects were 179 (2020: 134) GWh/a. As definitions of energy-efficiency improvement vary from that of the rest of the Fortum Group, the results of Uniper’s energy-efficiency improvement are not included in Fortum’s total energy-efficiency figures.
In 2021, Fortum completed significant projects improving energy efficiency, including: • the new heat pump at the Suomenoja plant in Finland, 104 GWh • improvements in heat recovery and decreasing leakages in the district heat network in the Espoo–Kirkkonummi area in Finland, 11 GWh • hydropower plant refurbishments in Finland and Sweden, 8 GWh • upgrade of district heating make-up water deaeration and raw water preheat systems at the Tyumen CHP-1 plant in Russia, 46 GWh. 
Uniper is also investing in energy-efficiency improvement projects. In 2021, a project was implemented to improve the energy efficiency of the gas turbine in different production modes, especially at part load, at the 428-MW Gönyü CCGT (Combined Cycle Gas Turbine) power plant in Hungary.
In 2021, the energy-efficiency improvement project was also completed at the 442-MW Enfield CCGT plant in the UK. The improvement makes it possible to consume less fuel in relation to the produced electricity and thus, to achieve a fuel efficiency of nearly 60%.
Energy-efficiency services Fortum has introduced energy-efficiency services for private customers, for example, in Finland and Sweden. Fortum’s customers can, for instance, monitor and reduce their electricity consumption or control and optimise the heating of their homes based on energy price and use� 4Services for homes 4Services for businesses 24 SUSTAINABILITY AT FORTUM CLIMATE AND RESOURCES PERSONNEL AND SOCIETY APPENDICES CLIMATE AND RESOURCES.

Fuel consumption Fortum uses various fuels, such as natural gas, coal, lignite, uranium, biomass fuels, and waste-derived fuels, to produce electricity, heat, and steam. The most significant fuel used in our energy production is natural gas� We use natural gas in, among others, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, Hungary, and the Netherlands. In 2021, our use of natural gas was about 61% of our total fuel consumption globally.
Fortum uses hard coal and lignite in Germany, Russia, the United. 
Kingdom, the Netherlands, Poland, and Finland. In our energy production in 2021, coal and lignite accounted for about 21% of our total fuel consumption�
In 2021, Russia’s share of our total fuel consumption was about 53%.
Russia accounted for about 80% of our use of natural gas.
Our use of nuclear fuel (i.e. uranium) was about 16% of our total fuel consumption. We used about 45 kilotonnes of nuclear fuel at the Loviisa nuclear power plant in Finland and at the Oskarshamn nuclear power plant’s unit 3 in Sweden.
In 2021, Fortum used biomass and other biofuels in the Netherlands, the Baltic countries, Finland, Poland, and Norway� In the Netherlands, biomass partly replaced the use of coal at the Maasvlakte power plant� In Finland and Norway, Fortum uses biomass and other biofuels at biofuelled heat plants�
In 2021, Fortum used waste-derived fuels at waste-to-energy plants in Klemetsrud, Norway; Riihimäki, Finland; Nyborg, Denmark; Kumla, Sweden; Zabrze, Poland; and Klaipeda, Lithuania.
The energy-specific fuel consumption has been calculated based on the usage volumes and fuel-specific caloric values measured at the power plants� Uranium consumption has been calculated from the thermal heat generation in the reactors�
Additionally, Uniper owns and operates the Fujairah oil refinery facility of low sulphur marine fuel oils in the United Arab Emirates, supplying products to local partners and large shipping companies�
Energy intensity In 2021, our fuel consumption in electricity, heat, and steam production was a total of 353 (2020: 252) TWh, or 1,271 (2020: 908) PJ. Additionally, we acquired 1.8 TWh, or 6.4 PJ, of electricity from external electricity suppliers�
With these energy resources, our net electricity production was about 134 (2020: 88) TWh and our net heat, steam and cooling production about 33 (2020: 29) TWh. The total energy consumption, calculated as the difference between the procured energy resources and net energy production, was about 187 (2020: 136) TWh, or 672 (2020: 488) PJ.
Our average fuel-use efficiency was about 51%. The efficiency has been calculated by dividing the net energy produced with the energy content of the fuels used in the energy production�
In 2021, the energy intensity of our own energy production was 1.8.
The intensity figure has been calculated by dividing the amount of used fuel resources by the total net energy production, including also hydropower, solar, and wind power globally� 4Origin of our fuels 4Production of marine fuels Fuel use in 2019–2021, mass/volume (GRI 301-1) 1) 2021 2020 2019.

80.8% Asset availability of gas-fired and coal-fired power plants. 
Security of supply A functional society requires an uninterrupted and reliable supply of energy� With hydropower, we are balancing the growing, but weatherdependent, fluctuating production of other renewable energy forms, like solar and wind, and we are enabling their growth� Hydropower’s flexibility is needed to secure the functionality of the energy system and the power grid also during energy consumption peaks and to balance fluctuations in the price of electricity.
If a sufficient supply of hydropower is not available, adjustable power production based on natural gas can be used to balance fluctuations in solar and wind power production and to secure the supply of electricity� Uniper’s gas-fired power plants, e.g., in Germany, can respond quickly to fluctuations in production, which is important for power grid stability. Additionally, Uniper’s natural gas supply, gas storage facilities, gas trading activities, and capacity for re-gasifying liquefied natural gas (LNG) enable a reliable and affordable supply of energy�
Uniper has planned a LNG terminal in Wilhelmshaven in Germany�
This will be closely linked to the plans to make Wilhelmshaven a green energy hub, with green hydrogen production to fulfill more than 10% of the German hydrogen demand in 2030.
Gas storage facilities can store energy between seasonal variations, and storages can also respond to consumption demand peaks� Uniper has about 7.4 bcm of underground gas storage capacity in Germany, Austria, and the United Kingdom.
With planned preventive maintenance and condition monitoring, we ensure that our power plants operate reliably to produce the electricity, heat, and steam customers need� Fortum also offers engineering services that help power plants improve their performance, including high availability�
Asset availability at a good level We measure the availability of power and heat plants with an energy availability indicator. In 2021, the asset availability of Fortum’s gasfired and coal-fired power plants was, on average, 80.8%. The asset availability of power generation includes planned outages in addition to unplanned technical unavailability� Each unavailability-related case of equipment failure is investigated to determine the causes, so that similar problems can be prevented at other power plants�
In 2021, the load factor of the Loviisa nuclear power plant was 92.9%. The load factor describing the availability of the Loviisa nuclear power plant is among the best in the world for pressurised water reactor power plants�
In 2021, the load factor of the Oskarshamn nuclear power plant’s unit 3 was 89.6%. The Oskarshamn plant is a boiling water reactor power plant� 26 SUSTAINABILITY AT FORTUM CLIMATE AND RESOURCES PERSONNEL AND SOCIETY APPENDICES CLIMATE AND RESOURCES.

Climate. 
Changes in our operating environment are driven by global megatrends that remain valid: climate change, technology development, active customers, and resource efficiency. The European Union is aiming for climate neutrality by 2050, and Fortum has set its climate targets accordingly� Climate change mitigation and adaption require political commitment and ambitious actions from different players in society�
Greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced in all sectors, not just in energy, but also, e�g�, in heating, cooling, industry, and transport. Electrification and sector integration mitigate climate change when electricity, replacing other energy sources, is produced and supplied by low-emission and renewable energy sources� Transitioning to a low-emission power system also enables the decarbonisation of other sectors through the coupling of CO2-free power generation and green hydrogen�
During the first quarter of 2021, both Fortum and Uniper became supporters of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)� Fortum has a long-standing focus on mitigating climate change and adopted the reporting recommendations of the TCFD already starting from the financial year 2019. Uniper disclosed its first TCFD report, as part of Uniper’s non-financial reporting, in spring 2022.

Governance Sustainability is an integral part of Fortum’s strategy� The highest decision-making authority on sustainability and climate-related matters is with the members of the Fortum Board of Directors, who share joint responsibility for these matters� The Board of Directors annually approves Group performance targets, including sustainability and climate-related targets� The Audit and Risk Committee (ARC), members of Fortum Executive Management (FEM), and other senior executives support the Board of Directors in the decision making in these matters, when necessary�
The Senior Vice President, Corporate Affairs, Safety and. 
Sustainability, has the overall responsibility for sustainability, which also includes climate-related issues in Fortum, excluding Uniper. She is a member of Fortum Executive Management (FEM), and, as a C-suite officer, she has the executive-level responsibility for Fortum’s TCFD reporting� Uniper is not represented in FEM� The Group also has an Executive Forum comprising executive managers of both companies. During 2021, climate-related matters, including Scope 3 target setting, were discussed in the Executive Forum.
The Uniper SE Management Board bears the overall responsibility for the adoption and implementation of Uniper’s sustainability measures, including climate-related measures� All members of Uniper’s Board hold joint responsibility for adoption and implementation of Uniper’s sustainability measures. Uniper’s Chief Operating Officer holds the role of Chief Sustainability Officer in the Board of Management and acts as the spokesperson on climate-related matters� Uniper’s Supervisory Board monitors the management of climate-related risks and opportunities as well as approves and oversees Uniper’s decarbonisation strategy� Uniper’s Supervisory Board is supported by the Audit and Risk Committee, which also reviews Uniper’s TCFD report, as part of4Uniper’s non-financial reporting�
Uniper’s Sustainability Council oversees and challenges the implementation of Uniper’s overall sustainability framework, including climate-related matters� It acts as an advisory body for the Board of Management. As of the fourth quarter of 2021, Fortum has been represented in Uniper’s Sustainability Council�
Both Fortum and Uniper have a specific review of the key climate- related risks by a group of experts from selected functions, including Sustainability, Strategy, Risk Management, Market Intelligence, Public Affairs, and Investor Relations� Fortum’s key climate-related risks are reported to FEM and the ARC as part of the annual review of material risks and uncertainties for Fortum� Responsibility for providing a consolidated view of Fortum’s production portfolio, its long-term development, and its alignment with the Group’s strategy and climaterelated targets falls under the Strategy function� Concrete actions are executed by the line management according to the annual planning.
Fortum’s climate-related risks are described in the4Financials 2021 report in the section Risk management�
Strategy Climate change is one of the main drivers behind Fortum’s strategy� Our strategy is designed to secure a fast and reliable transition to a carbonneutral economy by providing customers and societies with clean energy and sustainable solutions�
The Paris Agreement aims at limiting the global warming to well below 2°C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C by the end of the century� A central part of the Paris Agreement is to strengthen the global response to climate change mitigation and adaptation� Ambitious actions and investments are required to ensure the transition to the sustainable and low-carbon energy system needed to limit global warming.
Fortum believes that good progress is being made in the transformation of the electricity sector, and, e�g�, the EU emissions trading system will increasingly steer operations and investments towards CO2-free production technologies� This will accelerate the lowcarbon transition in society and create new business opportunities, but it alone will not be sufficient for the EU to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement� The European Union has agreed on the goal to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. This requires a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in all sectors, not just in energy but also in heating, cooling, industry, and transport; at the same time, carbon capture, utilisation and storage, and negative emissions must be increased�
Fortum has four strategic priorities to drive the energy transition and enable decarbonisation, affordability, and security of supply: 1. Transform own operations to carbon neutral 2. Strengthen and grow in CO2-free power generation 3. Leverage the strong position in gas to enable the energy transition 4. Partner with industrial and infrastructure customers. 
Transform own operations to carbon neutral In our first strategic priority, we focus on our own operations and power plants and reducing emissions from these sources� Fortum has committed to become carbon neutral (Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions) by 2050, which is aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Additionally, Fortum has committed to reduce CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2) in the European generation by at least 50% by 2030 compared to base-year 2019 and to become carbon neutral (Scope 1 and 2) in the European generation by 2035.
By 2030, Fortum will phase out or exit about 8 GW of coal-fired power generation. For natural gas-fired power generation, alternatives to decarbonise and transition to clean gas (e�g� hydrogen) are being assessed and pursued continuously, though not all technical solutions are known yet� In Russia, we aim to transform our business portfolio over time by reducing fossil exposure.
Strengthen and grow in CO2-free power generation Fortum is currently the third largest CO2-free power generator in Europe� We will optimise and maintain benchmark operations in hydro and nuclear power and grow a sizeable portfolio of onshore wind and solar. Our target is to build 1.5–2 GW of new renewable energy capacity by 2025, primarily in Europe.

Leverage the strong position in gas to enable the energy transition Fortum is a significant provider of flexible gas-fired generation and a major provider and trader of gas for European energy and industrial customers. We will decarbonise gas-fired power generation and transition to clean gases (e�g� hydrogen) over time, and we are actively assessing and pursuing opportunities for this. Examples of potential solutions include hydrogen conversion and carbon capture, utilisation and storage, though not all technical solutions are known yet or commercially available�
Partner with industrial and infrastructure customers Fortum will utilise its competences to help customers reduce their carbon footprint and environmental impacts. Examples of services include grid stability services to TSOs (Transmission System Operators), waste-to-energy and recycling solutions, and low-carbon industrial solutions. We will also build on our first-mover position in hydrogen to support industries to decarbonise their processes�
In 2021, Fortum set a Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions target. Fortum has committed to reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions by 35% by 2035 at the latest (compared to base-year 2021). The Scope 3 target relates mainly to strategic priorities 3 and 4.

Scenario analysis Fortum assesses external operating environment using four different scenarios, each describing a different degree of ambition in climate change mitigation, technological development, and evolution in the political landscape� We apply a scenario framework, where internal industry expertise is combined with assumptions derived from external benchmarks, such as the IEA (International Energy Agency), Bloomberg NEF, and IHS Markit.
The scenarios correspond to climate paths from below 2°C to over 3°C. Based on Fortum’s assessment, the operating environment seems to be aligned with somewhat over 2°C global warming. It defines Fortum’s base-scenario� All four scenarios are used in Fortum’s risk assessment, in which ‘well-below 2°C’ is dominated by transition risks, whereas in higher temperature scenarios physical risks, both acute and chronic, are increasingly present�
The pricing of greenhouse gas emissions is at the centre of Fortum’s scenarios. In Europe, the EU and the UK emissions trading systems (ETS) are expected to remain the key mechanism in reducing CO2 emissions� Globally, we see a clear need for an increased ambition in both reducing emissions and improving resource efficiency, in order to be in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement�
Fortum Group’s strategy is to transform own operations to carbon neutral, strengthen and grow in CO2-free power generation, leverage strong position in gas to enable the energy transition, and partner with industrial and infrastructure customers� Most strategic actions going forward (e�g� coal phase-out, increase in renewables and clean gases) are largely resilient with ‘well-below 2°C’ scenario.
Uniper’s scenario analysis and resilience tests are presented in. 
Uniper’s TCFD report, as part of4Uniper’s non-financial reporting�
Climate-related risks The management of climate-related risks is integrated into Fortum’s respective risk management frameworks and follows the same governance and processes as other material risks and uncertainties� Risks are regularly identified and assessed through a structured process� Risk owners are assigned for managing the risks and they are regularly reported and followed-up in various management teams and expert forums. As of 2022, Uniper will start to integrate the management of climate-related risks in its enterprise risk management (ERM) framework�
Climate-related risks are divided into two categories: transition risks and physical risks. The identified physical risks are generally found in the operational risk category, whereas transition risks are generally part of the strategic risk category�
Fortum’s climate-related risks are also described in the 4Financials 2021 report in the section Risk management� As Uniper currently does not apply the same approach to climate-related risks, the transition risks and physical risks described below have been assessed for Fortum, excluding Uniper.

Climate-related opportunities Fortum believes that the growing awareness and concern about climate change will increase the market demand for low-carbon and resource- and energy-efficient products and services. We also believe that the electrification of transportation, industry, and services will increase the consumption of low-carbon electricity in particular� Business opportunities creating climate benefits are further supported by our business area-specific targets. The transition underway leads to structural changes in various industrial sectors, opening up new opportunities, energy sources, and markets�
Fortum has announced an indicative growth capex of EUR 3 billion for 2021–2025. The actual amount will depend on market conditions, asset rotation, and balance sheet strength. The growth capex will be used to finance investments in four focus areas: • Renewables (50–55%) • Hydrogen and clean gas (about 15%) • Environmental and security of supply solutions • Other (e�g�, venturing, innovation, digitalisation)
Renewable and carbon-neutral energy sources As the market transforms towards climate neutrality and Europe decarbonises its energy system, coal-fired power generation will be largely replaced by renewable energy sources, i�e� wind and solar power� This will also increase the demand and value of flexible hydropower as well as base-load production, such as nuclear power� As the third largest CO2-free power generator in Europe, Fortum is well positioned to capture these opportunities�
In 2021, Fortum’s CO2-free power generation, including renewable energy and nuclear power, was 75 TWh. 64% of power generation in Europe, and 40% of total power generation globally was CO2-free�
Fortum targets to build 1.5–2 GW of new renewable power generation by 2025, primarily in Europe. Fortum’s investments in renewables, such as wind and solar power, are mainly done through partnerships (e�g� joint ventures and associates or other forms of cooperation).

investment decision for the construction of the 380-MW wind farm in Närpes and in Kristinestad, Finland. The wind turbines are expected to be fully commissioned in 2024.
In 2021, the refurbishments of Fortum’s own hydropower plants in Sweden and Finland produced 5 MW of new renewable electricity production capacity, excluding Uniper.
In Finland, the4Espoo Clean Heat project is transforming the City of Espoo’s district heating to carbon neutral by 2029. In 2021, the new 25-MW heat pump unit was commissioned at the Suomenoja plant. In 2022, Fortum will also increase its non-combustion-based heat production with the 11-MW air-to-water heat pump in Vermo, Espoo.
Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Carbon Capture and. 
Utilisation (CCU) are also key technologies in reaching climate neutrality� Fortum Oslo Varme’s CCS project has been a full-scale pilot to test CO2 capture at the Klemetsrud Waste-to-Energy plant in Norway since 2019. The project consists of a full CCS value chain, from capture to transport and storage of CO2, and includes several industrial actors�
Uniper has joined in the Zero Carbon Humber partnership, a project to achieve net zero carbon by 2040 using blue and green hydrogen and CCUS (Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage) solutions in the UK.
In 2021, Fortum invested EUR 335 (EUR 372) million in CO2-free energy production� Projects and investments under construction and decisions on new investments, as well as energy-efficiency and resource-efficiency improvements, are described in more detail in the sections4Energy and4Circular Economy�
Fortum’s research and development (R&D) activities also aim at building a platform for future growth in, e�g�, wind and solar power, demand response, and resource-efficient material recovery of batteries. In 2021, Fortum spent EUR 61 (EUR 56) million on research and development.
Energy markets and resilience during the transition Fortum’s climate advocacy is strongly based on climate science� In the Nordic countries, we are balancing with hydropower the growing, but weather-dependent, fluctuating production of other renewable energy forms, like solar and wind power, and we are enabling their growth�
The role of gas-fired power plants as a source of flexibility will also grow during the transition, especially in Central Europe. Gas-fired power plants also ensure a reliable supply by balancing out the fluctuations in wind and solar power to keep the electricity grid stable. For example, two Combined-Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGTs) will be commissioned at the Scholven power plant in Germany in the fourth quarter of 2022. This reduces carbon dioxide emissions into the environment in relation to the produced energy�
In the longer-term, natural gas-fired power generation will be replaced by the use of increasingly clean gases, e�g�, green hydrogen� Fortum and Uniper have one joint team focusing on the opportunities of hydrogen� We are looking forward to the possibilities to utilise our know-how of hydrogen and existing infrastructure at the power plants for hydrogen production, as the coal-fired power generation will be decommissioned�
Uniper also has cooperation with several plant suppliers to evaluate the feasibility of using hydrogen at power plants. For example, Uniper and its partner Ørsted will integrate wind power generation and a 70-MW electrolysis unit, which will be installed on the grounds of the decommissioned coal-fired Wilhelmshaven power plant in Germany. The unit is scheduled to begin producing green hydrogen in 2025. Uniper intends to expand Wilhelmshaven’s production capacity to 410 MW by 2030.
In Russia, the majority of our energy production is based on natural gas� Fortum has completed major investment programmes over the past decade and has transformed inefficient power units to more efficient power units that mainly use CCGT technology, which represents the best available technology in natural gas combustion (efficiency 80–85%).
Accelerated coal-exit for power generation In Fortum’s first strategic priority, we focus on our own operations and power plants and reduce emissions from these sources. By 2030,
Fortum will phase out or exit about 8 GW of coal-fired power generation, mainly in Europe�
In Finland, Fortum’s coal-fired Meri-Pori power plant has been selected for 440 MW of power generation capacity for the national peak-load reserve capacity system from July 2020 to June 2022. Fortum has also set a goal to discontinue the use of coal at the Suomenoja power plant in Espoo by 2025.
Fortum will phase out or exit its coal-fired power generation in. 
Germany, with the exception of the coal-fired Datteln 4 power plant, by 2025, in the United Kingdom by 2024, and in the Netherlands by 2029.
In Germany, Uniper’s 58% stake of the lignite-fired 900-MW. 
Schkopau power plant was sold in 2021. The 757-MW Wilhelmshaven power plant ceased coal-fired power generation at the end of 2021, and the focus will be on hydrogen. The coal-fired 875-MW Heyden power plant was taken out of commercial power generation at the end of 2020, and the power plant remains as a reserve capacity from July 2021 to September 2022, by the announcement of the German Federal Network Agency�
The coal-fired 345-MW Scholven C plant unit will cease commercial power generation at the end of October 2022, by the announcement of the German Federal Network Agency, and will be permanently decommissioned then� There is an ongoing construction project of two new CCGTs to replace the existing coal-fired Scholven power plant. The coal-fired 510-MW Staudinger 5 plant unit will be closed in May 2023.
In the United Kingdom, one of four 500-MW units of the coal- fired Ratcliffe power plant will be closed at the end of September 2022, which is two years earlier than the date announced by the UK Government for the coal phase-out.
In Poland, the old coal-fired Zabrze and Bytom CHP plants have been decommissioned and will be removed completely from operating capacity in 2022 onwards.
In July 2021, Fortum sold its coal-fired Argayash CHP plant.
Following the decision earlier in 2021 to transition from coal to gas at the Chelyabinsk CHP-2 plant, this transaction will reduce annual CO2 emissions by approximately 2 million tonnes and allow the Russia 34 SUSTAINABILITY AT FORTUM CLIMATE AND RESOURCES PERSONNEL AND SOCIETY APPENDICES CLIMATE AND RESOURCES.

Climate engagement lobbying Fortum’s climate policy advocacy is strongly based on climate science, and support for the Paris Agreement is the core principle underpinning Fortum’s climate advocacy. Fortum has expressed its support for the EU 2050 climate-neutrality goal and the revised 2030 target of at least 55% emission reduction, and we continue to lobby for legislation and policy instruments that will facilitate a cost-efficient transition towards a climate-neutral Europe by 2050.
Since the early 2000s, Fortum has been a firm supporter of ambitious EU climate policy with the EU emissions trading system (ETS) as the main instrument to implement and drive the climate policy objectives in the sectors covered by the tool, i�e� energy and industries� We believe that market-based, technology-neutral, and flexible carbon pricing is the most efficient and cost-effective way to drive decarbonisation in Europe�
In parallel with lobbying for tighter targets and a more extensive EU. 
ETS system, Fortum has advocated for the establishment of a global carbon pricing and carbon market in the context of various EU level and international initiatives. Fortum, excluding Uniper, is participating in a number of international initiatives promoting the role of business in climate change mitigation. These include, for example, the UN Global Compact’s Caring for Climate initiative and the World Bank’s Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition�
In line with Fortum’s updated strategy, climate lobbying is in the core of Fortum’s public affairs� Fortum pursues transparent, solution-driven, constructive, pro-active, forward-looking, and fact-based lobbying based on robust governance procedures� Corporate Affairs and Communications has the main responsibility for political engagement.
Fortum actively contributes to various public consultations at the. 
EU level and at the national level, and we publish all our position papers on our website� We also share our views and knowledge through other means of communication, such as through Fortum’s Corporate blog� Fortum’s core climate message has systematically been consistent: the EU climate policy ambition should be increased, the steering effect of the EU ETS should be strengthened, and more sectors should be brought into the scope of the EU ETS�
In addition to its own direct lobbying, Fortum is involved in several industry associations and company coalitions doing joint climate engagement lobbying� We publish information about our memberships in key industry associations on our website� The key industry associations include, among others, Eurelectric, Euroheat and Power, IETA, Finnish Energy, and Swedenergy� These organisations work on a consensus principle, and, therefore, their positions sometimes remain at a more general level than the individual company positions� The alignment of industry associations with our positions varies case by case, recognising that associations differ in terms of the profile of their members and the scope of their activities�
Fortum, excluding Uniper, never uses third parties to lobby for it� We strive for continuous development of our lobbying skills and practices with the aim to become a benchmark in lobbying among energy industries� Fortum does not make payments to political parties, organisations, or their representatives� Fortum is registered in the EU Transparency Register, ID: 03501997362-71. Respectively, Uniper’s number in the Register is 285977820662-03.
Climate Lobbying Review Fortum wants to be a forerunner in driving greater corporate transparency and accountability relating to climate change advocacy and to lobbying in general� In addition, we strive to meet the increasing expectations of the investor community regarding corporate climate actions and transparency in climate lobbying� As we are committed to the goals of the Paris Agreement, we want to ensure that the associations where we are a member are also lobbying in line with the Paris Agreement and our climate advocacy principles�
On this basis, Fortum carried out its first Climate Lobbying Review in 2021. The review was conducted by a third-party consultant. The review included the assessment of 15 industry associations and the assessment of Fortum’s own climate policy positions� We selected the associations based on a couple of criteria: we consider them to be 35 SUSTAINABILITY AT FORTUM CLIMATE AND RESOURCES PERSONNEL AND SOCIETY APPENDICES CLIMATE AND RESOURCES. 
Energy Climate Circular economy Emissions Water Biodiversity Climate


influential in climate-related public policy, they operate in regions or countries where we have significant business activities, and Fortum is considered influential in those industry associations. The selected associations represent the geographical coverage of our operations: Europe, Russia, and India�
The review included a thorough desktop review of the associations’ climate policy priorities and positions from 2019 until now through publicly available materials� When information was not available publicly, complimentary interviews were conducted directly with the associations�
The review showed that seven of the 15 associations reviewed are already fully aligned with the Paris Agreement and Fortum’s climate advocacy principles� Eight associations are partially aligned, including one misalignment on a key principle� When misalignments occur, they are often partial and explained by differences in preferred policy options or priorities�
According to the review, Fortum’s own climate lobbying positions are well aligned with the Paris Agreement� A key milestone still ahead is establishing a roadmap for our long-term target of carbon neutrality globally by 2050. In order to increase transparency and dialogue, we should also aim to make information on key climate principles and lobbying positions more readily and aggregately available to external stakeholders.
We consider this Climate Lobbying Review a continuously developing process and dialogue with our industry associations� Based on the current review, we will monitor and address misalignment whenever the associations’ current positions differ from our climate advocacy principles� We will have bilateral discussions with those associations that are partially aligned or misaligned and encourage them to take development actions� We will report on the progress of this dialogue and explain the actions we took as a result of this first review in our next Climate Lobbying Review in 2022.
4Fortum’s Climate Lobbying Review. 
Metrics and targets Transforming our own energy production and operations to carbon neutral is a strategic priority for us. In 2021, we also developed a new target for the reduction of indirect Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which play a significant role in our total greenhouse gas emissions.
To accelerate the development, we have committed to the following ambitious climate targets: • Reduction of CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2) in European generation by at least 50% by 2030 (compared to base-year 2019) • Carbon neutral (Scope 1 and 2) in European generation by 2035 at the latest • Reduction of Scope 3 GHG emissions by 35% by 2035 at the latest (compared to base-year 2021) • Carbon neutral (Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions) globally, in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement, by 2050 at the latest. 
Fortum’s long-term incentive (LTI) programme includes a climate-related metric. In the 2021–2023 LTI plan, the target is linked to the reduction of Fortum’s coal-fired power generation capacity in line with Fortum’s coal-exit path. In the 2022–2024 LTI plan, the target is related to the reduction of absolute CO2 emissions in the European fossil fleet, based on a fossil fleet review addressing the Group’s European generation portfolio and a pathway developed to reach Fortum Group’s 2030 and 2035 climate targets. Uniper continues to follow its own LTI plans. However, the carbon-related metric in the 2022–2024 LTI plan is applicable to both companies. Scaling of LTI metric is company-specific.

Fortum’s Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions. 
Greenhouse gas emissions Fortum’s greenhouse gas emissions are defined and reported according to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol guidelines� Our greenhouse gas emissions in 2021 totalled 190.2 (2020: 77.7) million tonnes. Scope 1 emissions were 69.1 (2020: 49.0) million tonnes, Scope 2 emissions 0.8 (2020: 0.8) million tonnes, and Scope 3 emissions 120.2 (2020: 27.8) million tonnes�
The figures for the comparison years for greenhouse gas emissions have not been adjusted or restated, due to insufficient data.
Direct greenhouse gas emissions – Scope 1 Fortum’s Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions accounted for about 36% of total greenhouse gas emissions. In 2021, our Scope 1 direct greenhouse gas emissions were 69.1 (2020: 49.0) million CO2-eq tonnes. The share of carbon dioxide emissions from our direct greenhouse gas emissions was 99%.
The majority of Fortum’s direct CO2 emissions, 68.7 (2020: 48.7) million tonnes, are generated from the use of fossil fuels in energy production. Of our direct carbon dioxide emissions, 57% originated from the Russian operations, 20% from Germany, 12% from the United Kingdom, 6% from the Netherlands, and 1% from Hungary as well as from Finland�
Of the direct carbon dioxide emissions in 2021, 28.9 (2020: 17.5) million tonnes were within the EU and the UK emissions trading system (ETS). About 42% of CO2 emissions from our energy production in Europe were within the sphere of the EU and the UK ETS. In 2021, Fortum was granted free emission allowances corresponding to 0.4 (2020: 0.9) million tonnes. In terms of emission allowances, we had a deficit and purchased the shortfall of emission allowances from the markets.
In 2021, Fortum’s direct biogenic carbon dioxide emissions were about 2.5 (2020: 2.3) million tonnes.

The calculation of greenhouse gas emissions covers carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), fluorinated hydrocarbons (HFCs), and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). Carbon dioxide emissions as well as methane and nitrous oxide emissions have been calculated on the basis of plant-specific fuel data. The amounts of HFC compounds and SF6 are mainly reported on the basis of the amounts of gas added to the equipment. Specific emission factors of gases are based on IPCC publications (IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, 2014 (AR5), 100-year time horizon).
Indirect greenhouse gas emissions – Scope 2 Fortum’s Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions accounted for less than 1% of total greenhouse gas emissions.

Other indirect greenhouse gas emissions – Scope 3 Fortum’s Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions accounted for about 63% of our total greenhouse gas emissions. Our Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2021 were estimated to be 120.2 (2020: 27.8) million tonnes. Our Scope 3 emissions originate mainly from fossil energy sources�
During 2021, Fortum together with Uniper conducted an in-depth review of the Scope 3 GHG emissions inventory. Where possible, also the accounting methodologies of Scope 3 GHG emissions were aligned. As part of the review, and to offer a full transparency of greenhouse gas emissions, Scope 3 category 11 was expanded to include not only emissions from the use of fossil fuels sold to end-users, but also sold to resellers. This expansion of the accounting scope resulted in a significant increase of Scope 3 category 11 GHG emissions.
Uniper’s GHG emissions of upstream transportation and distribution of natural gas, and downstream transportation and distribution of fossil fuels were included in 2021, as well as Uniper’s GHG emissions of waste and gypsum treatment�
The majority of our Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are caused by the use, transportation and distribution of sold products, such as natural gas, LNG and coal, the procurement of fuels and electricity retail, the purchase of goods and services, and capital goods, i�e� investments. Residual mix emissions of electricity retail have been included since 2020.

Emissions. 
Energy production and other production operations generate emissions to the environment, such as to air and water� We aim to control emissions caused by our operations and to reduce their environmental impacts by using technological solutions and flue-gas cleaning technologies.
Emissions to air Greenhouse gases that accelerate global climate change are generated primarily from the use of fossil fuels and the combustion of fossil-based waste� Flue-gas emissions causing local environmental and health impacts are generated from all combustion�
We aim to reduce impacts on air quality Nitrogen oxides (NOX) are generated from the nitrogen contained in the fuel and in the combustion air. Sulphur dioxide (SO2) is generated from the sulphur that is an impurity in, for example, coal, peat, and oil. Particle emissions are fine-grained ash generated primarily in the combustion of solid fuels and waste� Depending on the origin of the fuel and waste, the particles contain various heavy metals� It is possible to decrease nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide, and particle emissions through fuel choices, combustion technology, and various flue-gas cleaning technologies�
We have reduced flue-gas emissions in Poland with the commissioning of the new multi-fuelled Zabrze CHP plant, which has implemented Best Available Techniques (BAT), and, correspondingly, with the decommissioning of the old coal-fired Zabrze and Bytom CHP plants.
Fortum’s waste incineration plants located in Riihimäki, Finland, in. 
Kumla, Sweden, in Nyborg, Denmark, and in Oslo, Norway, are equipped with efficient flue-gas cleaning systems. Harmful emissions to air are minimised through the use of various filters and scrubbers selected on the basis of the waste to be incinerated�
Our carbon dioxide emissions are reported in the section4Climate�
Flue-gas emission requirements The EU has set very strict limits for flue-gas emissions; meeting the requirements necessitates the use of Best Available Techniques (BAT)� The BAT Reference (BREF) document sets stricter emission standards that European power plants must meet unless they obtain a formal derogation.
All Fortum’s power plants operate in compliance with the terms of their environmental permits, and, for the most part, the plants also meet the new emissions requirements in Europe� In Germany, e�g�, the Datteln 4 power plant is equipped with an advanced multi-step flue-gas cleaning system for controlling and reducing nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide, and particle emissions.
In 2021, new investments were made, e.g., in a flue-gas cleaning system at the Czestochowa CHP plant in Poland. Additionally, an upgrading project was carried out to reduce NOx emissions at the Kirchmöser power plant in Germany.
Emissions at Russian power plants are limited in accordance with. 
Russian legislation. At the lignite-fired Berezovskaya GRES plant, all three units have electrostatic precipitators installed to enable the efficient removal of particle emissions.
Our flue-gas emissions Our nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions were 63,900 (2020: 50,200) tonnes, our sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions 20,400 (2020: 17,900) tonnes, and our particle emissions 8,000 (2020: 9,600) tonnes. 75% of nitrogen oxide, 69% of sulphur dioxide, and 95% of particle emissions originated from Russian operations in 2021.
The reporting of at least nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide, and particle emissions from our European power plants is based on continuous measurements. Other flue-gas emissions data are based on discontinuous measurements or are calculated using fuel consumption data and specific emission factors. Specific emission factors are based on measurements taken at regular intervals, on information from the equipment supplier, or on regulatory norms�

Emissions to water Wastewater generated at power plants and other production facilities is treated either at the plant’s own wastewater treatment plant and discharged into a water system or it is piped to a municipal wastewater treatment plant for further processing� Even after treatment, plant wastewater may contain solids, nutrients, like nitrogen and phosphor, and heavy metals�
Wastewater effluents can impact local water quality as well as the nutrient and oxygen balance of the water system. In 2021, about 1.8 (2020: 1.0) tonnes of oil were released into water systems through wastewater generated in Fortum’s operations, excluding Uniper.
At the Chelyabinsk CHP-2 plant and the Argayash CHP plant in. 
Russia, the wet method is used to pump ash from the power plants into ash ponds� Some of the water from the ponds is recycled back to the power plants and some is released into a water system after sedimentation.
Investment plans for the Chelyabinsk CHP-2 plant and the. 
Chelyabinsk CHP-3 plant have been made to improve the wastewater treatment and to ensure that wastewater discharges comply with the permit limits in Russia. The Chelyabinsk CHP-3 plant investment project is estimated to be completed in 2023 and the Chelyabinsk CHP-2 plant project in late 2025.
In addition, in 2021, the water treatment process was improved to reduce wastewater emissions at Karlshamn power plant in Sweden.

Environmental incidents Fortum regularly monitors the major EHS (Environmental, Health and Safety) incidents. These, in part, reflect the quality of environmental management. As Uniper’s definitions of major EHS incidents vary from the rest of the Fortum Group, Uniper’s EHS incidents were not included in Fortum’s reporting in 2021.
Major environmental incidents include major spills and leaks of over 100 litres into the environment, significant environmental permit violations, and other major environmental non-compliances that have a significant impact on the environment. In 2021, major environmental incidents excluded the exceedances of wastewater emissions limits in Russia, arising from environmental permit change�
In 2021, there were eight (2020: 16) major EHS incidents, excluding Uniper; four (2020: 9) of them were classified as major environmental incidents. Three (2020: 8) were major spills and leaks into the environment, and one (2020: 1) was a major environmental non-compliance�
Additionally, the major EHS incidents consisted of two (2020: 6) major fires, one (2020: 0) explosion, and one (2020: 1) INES (International Nuclear Event Scale) level 1 incident.
Spills and leaks into the environment In 2021, there were three major spills and leaks into the environment, excluding Uniper. Major spills and leaks are defined as over 100 litres of harmful material, such as oil, hazardous chemicals, wastewater, or flammable gas, into the ground, water, or air.
Two of major leaks occurred in the recycling and waste operations in Finland� Additionally, there was an oil leak at a hydropower plant in Sweden� All incidents have been investigated to determine the corrective actions. The spills and leaks did not have significant environmental impacts�
Environmental non-compliances There was one (2020: 1) major environmental non-compliance in 2021, excluding Uniper. At the Riihimäki waste incineration plant in Finland, the mercury emission limit was exceeded in flue-gas emissions. The incident has been investigated to determine the corrective actions� The incident did not have significant environmental impacts, and no employees or contractors were exposed to mercury.
Environmental fines In 2018, untreated wastewater got into a trench and further into a waterway at the Kumla waste incineration and treatment site in Sweden, when the site’s wastewater treatment capacity was exceeded. In 2021, the official investigation was completed, and Fortum was imposed a fine of SEK 1 million (EUR 98,556).
In 2021, Fortum paid a fine of SEK 25,000 (EUR 2,464) for deviation from the minimum flow requirement at a hydropower plant in Sweden in 2018. Fortum also paid fines totalling PLN 7,865 (EUR 1,723) for exceeding flue-gas emissions limits at the old and new Zabrze CHP plants in 2018–2020.
In Russia, Fortum paid fines totalling RUB 150,000 (EUR 1,721) in 2021 for exceeding the wastewater emissions limits at the Argayash CHP plant. In July 2021, Fortum sold its coal-fired Argayash CHP plant. Fortum also paid fines of RUB 300,000 (EUR 3,442) for contamination of the soil near the ash dump of the Chelyabinsk CHP-1 plant.

Water. 
We use water mainly as cooling water in our condensing power plants� Water is also a prerequisite for Fortum’s hydropower production� Our responsibility for water use is related not only to water volume and availability, but also to its quality and to the aquatic habitat� We are improving the efficiency of our own water use, and we also offer services to our customers for the treatment, analysis, purification, and utilisation of their waste and sludge waters, and other severely polluted waters�
We use water within the limits set by our plants’ environmental and other permits� Permit regulations affect, e�g�, the water intake volume, the quality of discharged water, as well as discharges and water levels at hydropower plants� Additionally, we carry out water-related measures locally in order to take into consideration the needs of other water users as well�4Collaboration with local communities, municipalities, authorities, and research institutes is important in the implementation of these measures�
In addition to our own water use, we recognise that water use also has impacts in our supply chain, especially in fuel production�
Risks and opportunities related to water use The majority of our water withdrawal is used for cooling at condensing power plants� In most cases, we don’t consume water in our operations; it is discharged into the same water system from which it was withdrawn� Fortum has production operations using water in waterstressed areas in Germany, the UK, Russia, Poland, and the UAE, based on water-stress screening using the WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas� In water-stressed areas, water use is, by definition, generally large compared to the water resources available� In these areas, the risks may be related to, e�g�, water availability, increased cost of water, or restrictions in power production.
Efficient water management in hydropower production allows us to produce electricity at the right time and manage the impacts on the environment and on stakeholders� Hydropower is a good regulating power that enables other renewable energy sources, like wind and solar power, to be added to the grid� In Sweden, a national plan for the reassessment of hydropower for modern environmental conditions, implementing the EU Water Framework directive and targets for renewable energy, has the ambition to keep production losses at a minimum and limited to 1.5 TWh/a. Fortum is a participant in the joint hydropower environmental fund (Vattenkraftens miljöfond AB), the purpose of which is to fund environmental measures linked to the national plan and to compensate for production losses�
Fortum is systematically reducing risks related to dam safety�
A long-term programme is in place for improving the surveillance of the condition of dams and for securing the discharge capacity in extreme flood situations.
Climate change is likely to change weather patterns and hydrological conditions in the regions where we operate� Warmer climate and water scarcity are likely to affect the amount of cooling water available for some of our thermal power plants and lead to the need for new cooling or process water sources. We have already experienced some cooling water shortage at some of our power plants due to an increase in water temperature, especially in Central Europe� Climate change may reduce or increase the amount of water and change the timing of water availability for hydropower plants, depending on the location�
In our operations we are preparing for changes in water availability and hydrological conditions� The preparations are related to, for example, production planning, investments, dam safety, flood protection, and the rise in the cooling water temperature�
In hydropower production planning we are preparing for climate change by taking into consideration changes in precipitation and temperature and extreme weather phenomena, which can cause droughts or flooding. We are also monitoring the need for adjustments to regulation permits with changes in seasonal variation as a result of climate change�
Improving the efficiency of water use in our operations can reduce environmental impacts, generate cost savings, ensure the acceptance of our operations, and also ensure the supply of water for other purposes and for other users�
Water withdrawal and forms of water use The majority of our power and heat production using water is located in Russia, the Nordic countries, Central Europe, and the UK. The Baltic Sea, the North Sea, and local freshwater systems are our most important water sources� Brackish water of the Baltic Sea is reported here as seawater� In some cases, we also collect and use rainwater, which is included in fresh surface water in our reporting� Additionally, small amounts of municipal water and fresh groundwater are used at power plants and in waste treatment services� The reported water withdrawal, water use, and discharge volumes are based on measurements and on calculations of water consumption�
In 2021, our total water withdrawal was about 12,359 (2020: 8,847) million m3, of which fresh surface water accounted for 61% in total and seawater accounted for 39%.

Cooling water in energy production Condensing power production requires large volumes of cooling water� Fortum’s cooling water withdrawal in 2021 was about 11,987 (2020: 8,573) million m3. Cooling water accounts for about 97% of our water withdrawal�
Cooling water is used at several condensing and CHP plants� The cooling water is, in almost all cases, withdrawn from a local water system, such as a sea, lake, or river� Several power plants, e�g�, in Russia and Germany, use cooling towers in which some of the cooling water evaporates into the atmosphere� 26% of Fortum’s total cooling water use takes place at two nuclear power plants, at Loviisa in Finland and at Oskarshamn in Sweden� Both use direct seawater cooling� No water is consumed in the cooling process, and water withdrawn from the sea is discharged back into the sea, albeit at a warmer temperature within permit limits�
Process water A thermal power plant needs water in the water-steam cycle when electricity is generated with a steam turbine� Because of leaks in the pipes, occasionally water must be added to the water-steam cycle�
Water is also needed in power plant auxiliary processes, for example in flue-gas cleaning with wet scrubber technology, and in radioactive waste handling and storage at nuclear power plants� Water is also used in processes at waste treatment facilities, e�g�, for ash treatment�
District heating water Fortum is a supplier of district heat in Russia, the Nordic countries, the Netherlands, Germany, and Poland� Water is used as the heat transfer medium in district heating� Because of leaks in district heating pipelines, make-up water must be occasionally fed into district heating networks.
Fortum has increased condition monitoring and maintenance at the district heating network in Espoo-Kirkkonummi area in Finland. This has.

Fortum is currently investigating the possibility to use machine learning and geographic dataset analytics to pinpoint heat loss and leakages in 2022. The target for 2022 is to further reduce the need for additional water by 27,000 m3 from the previous year.
Hydropower production Fortum produces hydropower from water flowing in rivers in Sweden, Germany, and Finland� Our hydropower production in the Nordic countries is not in water-stressed areas� Water is not consumed in hydropower production, the water quality is not significantly changed, and it is not typically directed to another water system� However, the water system is often regulated for hydropower production, and the regulation changes the water flow and level patterns compared to their natural state� The water use-related projects implemented with stakeholder groups are reported in the section4Corporate citizenship�
We have precise knowledge of the water situation in those waterways where we produce hydropower, and we use real-time hydrological forecasts in production planning� Fortum doesn’t report river flows as a hydropower production-related water withdrawal.
We stock fish to offset the impacts of hydropower production. Some of the fish are farmed at our own fish farms in Finland and Sweden. The majority of the fresh water withdrawn for fish farming is returned into the bodies of water with only a slight change in its properties� Discharged water is purified, when necessary, and its nutrient content is monitored in line with permit conditions�
In addition to storage and run-of-river hydropower, Uniper has pumped-storage hydropower plants in Germany� These plants are a type of hydroelectric energy storage used by electric power systems for load balancing� 45 SUSTAINABILITY AT FORTUM CLIMATE AND RESOURCES PERSONNEL AND SOCIETY APPENDICES CLIMATE AND RESOURCES.

Water use in water-stressed areas According to the4WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, accessed on 2 December 2021, the operations in areas with a high (40–80%) water-stress level include 12 thermal power plants in Russia, Germany, Poland, and the UK, hydropower plants on the River Main (37) and in other locations (8) in Germany, as well as an oil production facility in the UEA. The classification of water-stressed locations is based on the WRI Aqueduct data, not on actual issues of water scarcity experienced in our operations. Our water use figures still include water use in the Pavagada solar power plant in India, divested in 2021, which is located in an area with an extremely high (>80%) water stress, as well as data of other divested power plants in areas of high water-stress level�
Our water withdrawal in water-stressed areas was about 408 million m3, which was about 3% of our total water withdrawal. 58% of the water withdrawal in water-stressed areas was in Russia, 41% in Germany, 0.1% in the UAE, 0.04% in Poland, 0.01% in the UK, and 0.0003% in India. 88% of the water withdrawal in water-stressed areas was used for cooling.
In the areas of extremely high water stress in India, we reduce water use by, e�g�, robotic waterless cleaning solutions and rain water harvesting at our partly-owned solar power plants. In 2021, about 82% of Fortum’s solar capacity (including co-owned plants) in India was cleaned using robotic waterless cleaning; the target is to install waterless cleaning in all future solar plants that we commission in India.
The Kirchmöser power plant in Germany abstracts water for cooling from Lake Plauer, in an area of high water stress� Uniper has investigated a number of options for partially replacing the volume of abstracted water� The most ecological and economical option was found to be abstraction of groundwater from existing wells some distance away and pumping this groundwater into Lake Heiliger, one of the sources that feed Lake Plauer� In this way, an overall balance is achieved and the ecological condition of the lake can be maintained�

In addition to the cooling water discharge, Fortum discharges process water and wastewater. In 2021, Fortum’s total water discharge was about 12,009 (2020: 8,660) million m3; only about 2% of it was process and wastewater, the rest was cooling water� The process and wastewater is purified, when needed, before release into the environment; some water is piped to municipal treatment plants� The discharged water is mainly cooling water released into fresh surface water� Emissions into water are reviewed in the section4Emissions to water�

Water consumption Our water consumption includes, e�g�, cooling water that has evaporated from cooling water towers, water leakage from district heating networks, water used in power plant and other production plant processes,4water used to move ash, e�g� at power plants in Russia, and water used to clean solar panels. In 2021, our own water consumption was about 344 million m3� In water-stressed areas, our water consumption was about 54 million m3�
We estimate water consumption as the difference between water withdrawal and discharge� Fortum’s own water consumption doesn’t include about 6 million m3 of water supplied to external customers and water leaked from the district heating networks owned by external parties.

Number of major voluntary measures enhancing biodiversity. 
Biodiversity. 
The degradation of biodiversity is one of the biggest environmental problems globally� We need to know our impacts and dependencies on biodiversity and ecosystem services to be able to assess the related risks and opportunities�
Biodiversity rising on global, EU, and Fortum agenda In 2021, biodiversity was increasingly a focus of public discussion. We actively follow the development of concrete actions in implementing the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 as well as the anticipated post-2020 global biodiversity framework within the global Convention on Biological Diversity. The EU is expected to publish nature restoration targets and targets for protected areas to meet the 30% of land and sea areas protected by 2030. In addition, the EU is expected to propose new taxonomy criteria for biodiversity and a target for free flowing rivers. Biodiversity loss and the degradation of ecosystems are a severe global concern that has to be tackled� Fortum supports the global and EU targets for biodiversity.
In Fortum’s materiality analysis, biodiversity is identified as one of. 
Fortum’s sustainability priorities. For the year 2021, we set our first Group-level target for biodiversity. In 2021, we also increased our internal communication on biodiversity; e�g�, we had a presentation open to all employees on biodiversity and its relevance to Fortum� During 2022, we are committed to develop a science-based strategy to measure and enhance the biodiversity impacts of the Group’s operations and the new developments.
Impacts on biodiversity Our operations, such as hydropower production in Sweden, Germany, and Finland, impact local biodiversity� Construction of hydropower and the water regulation related to hydropower alter the conditions in water systems and thus impact the diversity of the local aquatic habitat and, in particular, the fish population. However, hydropower is important in the fight against climate change, which is globally one of the greatest threats to biodiversity� Emissions from fossil fuel-based energy production may decrease biodiversity also locally� Increasing CO2-free production mitigates the biodiversity loss caused by climate change� Construction of all facilities may have impacts on biodiversity�
Indirect impacts may be caused by, for example, procurement of biomass for use as fuel or raw material, as well as the procurement of other fuels�
Our responsibility for biodiversity Fortum’s4Biodiversity Manual defines the company’s, excluding Uniper, principles related to biodiversity� According to the manual, biodiversity issues are systematically considered as part of our environmental management processes and our operations� The manual contains specific instructions for biodiversity issues in current operations, new projects, and the supply chain, as well as for reporting and communication� We annually update our4Biodiversity Action Plan, which contains ongoing and planned voluntary biodiversity-related measures. In 2021, we included also biodiversity measures in Uniper in the Action Plan� The Biodiversity Action Plan describes Fortum’s goals, responsibilities, timelines, and partners for biodiversity projects�
We aim to improve biodiversity in connection with our operations, we carry out biodiversity-related projects, and we collaborate with our stakeholders in projects� We also assess the biodiversity impacts of our new projects and aim to mitigate them� We offset and reduce our biodiversity impacts in, e.g., hydropower production. In 2021, Fortum, excluding Uniper, carried out fish obligations, valued at about EUR 2.2 million in hydropower production. In 2021, we also worked increasingly with surveys and the removal of invasive species�
Managing impacts in the supply chain We manage the biodiversity impacts of our fuel procurement by using international certification and assessment systems. We pay special attention to the procurement of wood-based biomass and coal� Under the Fit for 55 legislative package published in July 2021, the European Commission made a proposal for the new renewable energy directive, which includes new stricter requirements for sustainable biomass� Fortum is closely following the development of regulations and guidelines and is preparing to implement the required additions to our current biomass sourcing processes� The impact on Fortum Group is expected to be limited.
Certified wood-based biomass fuel originates from sustainably managed forests in which the preservation of biodiversity has been a focus. In 2021, we used wood-based biomass fuel in our power plants in Finland, Norway, Poland, and the Netherlands. 86% of the woodbased biomass fuel purchased by Fortum originated from certified or controlled sources�
Fortum and Uniper are members of the Bettercoal initiative and use the Bettercoal Code and tools in assessing the sustainability of the coal supply chain� Biodiversity aspects related to coal mining are covered in Bettercoal assessments� Assessment criteria are related to, e�g�, preventing the disappearance or fragmentation of habitats, combating invasive species, and preventing adverse hydrological changes, nutrient accumulation, and environmental pollution. At year-end 2021, 67% of coal volume purchased via direct contract was from Bettercoal suppliers�

Projects improving biodiversity Most of our projects improving biodiversity are related to hydropower production� Additional information about our projects supporting biodiversity is available in the Biodiversity Action Plan and 4on our website� In addition to voluntary projects, biodiversity-related measures are often carried out as license obligations�
Fortum Group’s biodiversity target Fortum achieved its biodiversity target for year 2021: at least 12 major voluntary measures enhancing biodiversity� We implemented 413 major voluntary measures� These measures, focusing on threatened species or habitats, improve the living conditions of species and strengthen populations� The measures are related to hydropower production and include restoring aquatic and terrestrial habitats, improving fish migration, and strengthening migratory fish populations, as well as projects combating invasive species� In addition to the physical measures counted in the target, we carried out a number of other improvements in several types of operations, both concrete projects and investigations�
During 2022, Fortum’s target is to develop a science-based strategy to measure and enhance the biodiversity impacts of the Group’s operations and the new developments� We will also continue with measures enhancing biodiversity in 2022.
Improving fish migration and migratory fish populations To strengthen the lifecycle of fish, we use a number of solutions, like fish stocking, habitat improvements, various types of fishways, and trap and transport systems for fish to pass the dams.
In Finland, we increased the number of fish transported to restored spawning areas in tributaries from our trap and transport device in Montta� In the Oulujoki area, we are improving the lifecycle of threatened Oulujärvi lake trout by installing a hydraulic dam bypass solution, Fishheart, at Leppikoski and participating in habitat restorations and juvenile fish stockings.
We have continued our programme of dismantling small dams in Sweden�
The programme has a total of about 80 dams that are no longer significant for water regulation and energy production� In conjunction with the dam removal work, the river continuum is restored and stream water habitats can be re-established� The projects are implemented in close collaboration with local actors and residents. In 2021, three dams were removed.
In Germany, with the construction of the three fish ladders at Uniper’s. 
Prittriching (finalisation of the outdoor works in 2022), Scheuring, and Schwabstadl power plants, fish can once again migrate along 20 km of the River Lech, from Kaufering to Merching.
Fortum is constructing three fishways allowing fish to migrate both up- and downstream of the hydropower plants in River Dalälven, Sweden, based on a decision by the environmental court. The fishways at the Spjutmo, Blyberg and Väsa hydropower plants will be operational in 2023–2025.
Uniper has also continued its voluntary trap and transport programme of endangered eels in the River Main in Germany and the stocking of young eels in the River Ätran in Sweden�
Restoring and improving habitats Our habitat improvements related to hydropower production in 2021 include continuation of Uniper’s project with the local water management authority to improve habitats at the Litzauer Schleife (Litzau Loop) in Germany.
In partnership with the Munkfors Fishery Conservation Association in Sweden, Fortum has implemented4a biotope preservation project downstream of the Munkfors power plant to improve the flowing water environment for salmonids, particularly graylings.
We also restored or improved several terrestrial habitats in order to support threatened species or habitats, often in cooperation with other parties� In addition to the terrestrial improvements around Fortum’s hydropower plants, these included creating a meadow in Inkoo, Finland, and continuation of the restoration of the Kumla butterfly landscape in Sweden� In Germany, at the Franken power plant, several species of trees were planted creating a habitat for a wide variety of flora and fauna. A wildflower meadow was created around the trees to attract insects.

Case | Artificial intelligence and hydraulic pressure enable fish to migrate upstream at Leppikoski hydropower plant in Finland. 
The hydraulic Fishheart fishway is a Finnish innovation enabling fish to migrate past obstacles. Fishheart is a floating, mobile system installed in the power plant’s tailrace channel; the system has an attraction flow that guides fish into the opening of the device. Fishheart uses artificial intelligence to detect fish that swim in and then moves the fish via pipes over the dam. During the transfer, fish are constantly surrounded by water to ensure their safe ride�
Fortum’s goal is to strengthen the natural cycle of the threatened Oulujärvi lake trout in the vicinity of the Leppikoski hydropower plant in the Hyrynsalmi waterway in the Oulujoki water shed� National Fish Way Strategy’s key sites in the Oulujoki water shed for restoring fish migration are located in the Hyrynsalmi waterway, which has breeding areas and habitats vital to the natural life cycle of migrating fish.
The Fishheart fishway at the Leppikoski hydropower plant in Finland was installed in August 2021� During the first season Fishheart was used to successfully transfer many 60+ centimetre mature lake trout� Overall, the Fishheart fishway has transferred nearly 2,500 fish upstream from the Leppikoski power plant dam� In addition to trout, Fishheart has registered other fish species, including perch, lamprey, bream, vendace, whitefish, and pike perch. Leppikoski’s Fishheart is one of Fortum’s voluntary measures advancing biodiversity with the aim to reinforce migratory fish populations.
Each river and hydropower plant is unique Fortum is looking for effective solutions that both support the strengthening of fish stocks and enable the production of renewable hydropower� Each river and hydropower plant is unique, and thus solutions vary by river and hydropower plant. To enable fish migration, a variety of different tools and measures are needed. The Fishheart fishway is a viable alternative for hydropower plants with a tightly built environment, such as Leppikoski�
Fishheart in Leppikoski is part of a set of measures being implemented to strengthen the natural life cycle of lake trout� The tributaries upstream from the Leppikoski power plant provide potential habitats and breeding grounds essential for the life cycle of the trout population; this year there have been habitat restorations in tributaries Torvenkoski and Tolosenjoki� Moreover, Fortum is annually stocking lake trout fry on the Hyrynsalmi route in an effort to strengthen the fish population that imprints to the river� 51 SUSTAINABILITY AT FORTUM CLIMATE AND RESOURCES PERSONNEL AND SOCIETY APPENDICES CLIMATE AND RESOURCES.

Circular economy. 
Reliable waste management and resource efficiency are important in a sustainable society� We offer customers sustainable circular economy services and expert solutions for waste recycling� We also recover by-products and waste generated in our own energy production whenever possible�
Waste received from customers Fortum’s aim is to promote resource efficiency, for example, through its recycling and waste business, and the transition towards a more extensive circular economy. By circular economy, we mean that materials are utilised as efficiently as possible and hazardous materials are removed from circulation� The aim is to make new raw material from waste whenever possible and to keep valuable materials in circulation�
Our circular economy business evolves In 2021, Fortum decided to invest in a new4hydrometallurgical plant in Harjavalta, Finland, where Fortum had a pilot facility earlier� The investment is a major step in increasing our hydrometallurgical recycling capacity and enabling the production of sustainable battery chemicals� The new facility will help to meet the rising demand for recycled battery materials and enable the safe and sustainable recovery of lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, all of which are essential in the manufacturing of new electric vehicle (EV) batteries�
We also opened a new mechanical4EV battery recycling process line in Ikaalinen, Finland. Fortum has the special expertise needed in handling lithium-ion batteries at the end of their life� Lithium-ion batteries are classified as hazardous waste, as they can pose a high risk for people and for the environment if not treated properly� We use a combination of mechanical and low-carbon hydrometallurgical technologies to recycle the batteries as sustainably as possible and with a low carbon footprint. The lithium-ion batteries are first disassembled and treated in a mechanical process at our plant in Ikaalinen� The battery’s black mass, containing valuable metals, is collected and taken to Harjavalta for hydrometallurgical processing� Together these two processes are estimated to reach a recovery rate of up to 95% of the metals included in the valuable materials of a battery’s black mass�
The new Harjavalta plant will enable Fortum to recycle the majority of the EV batteries reaching their end-of-life in Europe. In 2021, Fortum was granted special transport permits that allow Sweden and Norway to export4lithium-ion batteries to Finland for recycling� We aim to ramp up our battery recycling operations and to increase the recycling capacity significantly in the coming years. We also pilot several ‘second-life’ solutions, such as the reuse of batteries for energy storage in power plants�
In 2021, Fortum and Suomen Uusiomuovi Oy signed a long-term contract prolongation for recycling of consumer plastic packaging at our Riihimäki plant in Finland. Prolongation of the existing contract enables the planning of recycling capacity investments at the Riihimäki plant, which is important, as the plant is currently operating at full capacity� The new planned investment would eventually replace the current mechanical plastic recycling plant� Besides investigating possibilities for a next-generation mechanical recycling plant, Fortum is also looking into new technologies beyond mechanical recycling, such as chemical recycling and CCU (Carbon Capture and Utilisation) solutions, in order to achieve a circular economy and a better recycling rate� Furthermore, in order to advocate for a circular economy, we started cooperation with K-Group with the aim to promote Fortum Circo® – recycled plastic granulates used as raw material for various consumer products in the grocery business�
At4BauMineral in Central Europe, Uniper receives and treats power generation customers’ by-products, such as bottom ash, fly ash, and gypsum� BauMineral recycles by-products from power plants into new building materials� The ongoing energy transition to decarbonise societies is affecting the availability of power generation plants’ traditional by-products, which have been re-used as low-carbon building materials replacing cement� BauMineral is actively working on how to sustainably replace the traditional by-products so that the energy transition doesn’t negatively impact the carbon emissions produced by other industries� 52 SUSTAINABILITY AT FORTUM CLIMATE AND RESOURCES PERSONNEL AND SOCIETY APPENDICES CLIMATE AND RESOURCES.

Our waste management services Fortum offers waste management services for customers in the Nordic countries, Central Europe, and Poland� Of the waste stream received from customers, as much as possible is recycled, reused, or recovered as raw material.
Waste that is unsuitable for recycling or reuse as a material is incinerated in our waste-to-energy plants in the Nordic countries and Poland� This reduces the use of virgin fossil or renewable fuels in electricity and heat production. Waste that is unsuitable for recovery is disposed of at landfill sites.
In 2021, we received a total of 2.7 (2020: 2.7) million tonnes of waste from our customers, about 48% (2020: 55%) of which was recovered in waste-to-energy plants. Of the waste received from our customers, about 1.9 (2020: 2.0) million tonnes was non-hazardous waste, with ash accounting for 26% (2020: 21%) and contaminated soil for 9% (2020: 15%). We also received about 720,000 (2020: 640,000) tonnes of hazardous waste from our customers, with ash accounting for 10% (2020: 10%) and contaminated soil for 19% (2020: 15%)
Recovery of materials Various types of waste can be reused as raw materials. In 2021, of the waste received from our customers, we recovered about 870,000 (2020: 800,000) tonnes as materials; various environmental construction materials accounted for 52% (2020: 41%) of that amount, recoverable ash 25% (2020: 39%), and processed raw materials and products 7% (2020: 11%). In addition, about 1.6 (2020: 1.0) million tonnes of recoverable materials originated at Fortum’s own power and heat plants globally�
We are continuously developing activities that increase the proportion of waste materials kept in circulation, among others: • We produce4recycled plastic out of plastic packaging waste received from customers • We process and4recycle metals separated from customers’ waste and from ash and slag generated in customers’ energy production� We also recycle scrap metals generated in the maintenance activities of our own power and heat plants • We treat and process ash, slag, dredging masses, slurry, and contaminated water from energy production and other industries for reuse in various types of products, environmental construction, and earthwork projects • We treat contaminated soil received from our customers, and we direct metal, rocks, concrete, and wood sieved from the soil for reuse as raw materials� Soil that is suitable for environmental construction is used at construction sites and at our own industrial waste treatment centres� 53 SUSTAINABILITY AT FORTUM CLIMATE AND RESOURCES PERSONNEL AND SOCIETY APPENDICES CLIMATE AND RESOURCES.

83% of own energy production plants’ by-products and waste recovered. 
Hazardous waste treatment We offer solutions to treat4hazardous waste� We take hazardous waste out of circulation in a sustainable manner, and we clean the hazardous substances from materials that end up in recycling� At the same time, we produce energy and ensure the safe final disposal of waste� High-temperature incineration is the best available solution to deactivate most hazardous substances� Additionally, some other waste types are treated with other processes, such as a physico-chemical process�
We have three high-temperature incineration plants producing electricity and district heating for the surrounding areas: in Riihimäki, Finland; Nyborg, Denmark, and Kumla, Sweden. In addition, the Klemetsrud waste-to-energy plant in Oslo, Norway, treats also special waste, e.g., hospital waste and goods confiscated by customs and police officials. In 2021, about 344,800 (2020: 357,300) tonnes of hazardous waste and, additionally, about 614,300 (2020: 631,000) tonnes of non-hazardous waste were incinerated at these facilities�
Waste and by-products from our energy production Ash is a by-product generated in the incineration of solid fuels in power and heat production� Gypsum and other desulphurisation products are by-products of flue-gas desulphurisation. Ash and desulphurisation products together account for the majority of the by-products and waste from our energy production�
The maintenance of power and heat plants generates scrap metal, other conventional industrial waste and, to a smaller extent, waste oil and other hazardous waste� We aim for the highest possible utilisation and recovery of our own by-products and waste� The waste management service providers we use are properly licensed and reliable waste management companies�
The total volume of by-products and waste generated at all Fortum’s power and heat plants in 2021 was about 2.2 (2020: 1.7) million tonnes. Of this volume, about 83% (2020: 75%) was recovered.
Ash and gypsum as by-products About 78% (2020: 69%) of the ash from our plants operating in Europe is utilised as a raw material, for example, for the construction industry, road construction, and soil improvement, and as backfill. Coal-fired power plants can also generate either a wet or semi-dry desulphurisation by-product in the flue-gas cleaning systems. Ash from the coal-fired power plants in Russia is stored, e.g., in ash basins, because there is no industrial solution for the use of wet ash sludge in Russia.
In 2021, about 1.5 (2020: 1.2) million tonnes of ash and 574,600 (2020: 366,500) tonnes of gypsum were generated. By-products that cannot be utilised are transported to the appropriate final disposal sites at landfills or, e.g., to ash basins in Russia. The reported volumes of ash and gypsum from our European power plants are mainly based on the weighing of the truckloads� Ash volumes at our Russian power plants are calculated on the basis of the ash content of the coal�

Radioactive waste In addition to conventional industrial waste, the Loviisa nuclear power plant in Finland and the Oskarshamn nuclear power plant in Sweden generate radioactive waste, which we treat in accordance with the requirements of national nuclear energy legislation� According to Finnish legislation, nuclear waste generated in Finland has to be finally disposed of in Finland, and nuclear power plant companies are responsible for their respective nuclear waste management� Swedish legislation is similar with regard to responsibilities� The volume of radioactive waste generated is small, but special solutions are needed in its treatment and final disposal.
High-level radioactive waste from spent nuclear fuel is stored in an interim storage at the Loviisa power plant site� In Finland, Fortum and Teollisuuden Voima have established Posiva Oy to handle the technical implementation of the final disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and final disposal is scheduled to begin at Olkiluoto in Eurajoki around the mid2020s. The final disposal of Loviisa’s spent nuclear fuel will begin in the 2040s.
The high-level radioactive waste from spent nuclear fuel at the. 
Oskarshamn nuclear power plant is transported to the Clab, Central Interim Storage Facility for Spent Nuclear Fuel, pending final disposal. The Clab is located near the Oskarshamn plant at Simpevarp in Sweden� The spent nuclear fuel will be eventually transported to the future Spent Fuel Repository near the Forsmark nuclear power plant in Sweden� In 2021, 45 (2020: 40) tonnes of spent nuclear fuel was removed from nuclear power plant reactors in Finland and Sweden�
Intermediate-level radioactive liquid is generated mainly from spent ion-exchange resins and wastewater from the controlled area at the Loviisa nuclear power plant� Liquid waste is processed into solid form at the solidification plant for liquid radioactive waste before final disposal in Loviisa’s repository. In 2021, 111 (2020: 510) m3 of intermediate-level radioactive waste from the Loviisa plant went to final disposal. The Oskarshamn nuclear power plant’s intermediate-level radioactive waste will be transported to the final repository near the Forsmark nuclear power plant, Sweden�
The Loviisa nuclear power plant’s low-level radioactive maintenance waste is disposed of in Loviisa’s repository in Finland. In 2021, 80 (2020: 29) m3 of low-level radioactive waste from the Loviisa plant went to final disposal. The Oskarshamn nuclear power plant’s low-level radioactive maintenance waste will be disposed of using the latest landfill technology at the Simpevarp landfill site near the Oskarshamn power plant, Sweden�
In 2021, 72 m3 of radioactive maintenance waste from the Loviisa and the Oskarshamn nuclear power plant went to interim storages waiting for final disposal.
In addition to radioactive waste from nuclear power plants in operation, the decommissioning and dismantling projects at the Barsebäck unit 1 and unit 2, and the Oskarshamn unit 1 and unit 2 nuclear power plant generate radioactive waste in Sweden. In 2021, 1,969 (2020: 1,521) tonnes of low-level and 301 (2020: 154) tonnes of intermediate-level radioactive waste from the decommissioning projects went into the interim storage waiting for final disposal in Sweden.

The exception to this is India, where we offer an additional four weeks of leave on top of what is stipulated by law. We offer flexible work schedules and remote working in positions that do not require presence at the workplace� Remote working remained at a high level in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
In Finland, Fortum annually drafts company-specific gender equality plans in collaboration with personnel representatives� Using various statistics, the gender equality plans examine the realisation of equality between men and women in the company’s Finnish operations� Additionally, the plans lay out measures to further improve equality, such as promoting minority gender in different job grades, ensuring equal opportunities in training and career development, and correcting unjustified pay gaps between women and men if detected. In addition, separate equality promotion plans address various forms of equality, such as age, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion etc. Equality promotion plans are drafted annually at the corporate level for units operating in Finland� Their purpose is to assess the realisation of equality at the workplace and to develop working conditions and ways of operating to be followed when selecting employees and when making decisions affecting employees�
In 2021, Fortum joined a newly launched initiative, the Diversity. 
Roundtable of Finnish companies and universities� Managers and employees of Fortum corporate functions and all managers in divisions (excluding Fortum Russia and Uniper) were encouraged to participate in the diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) survey conducted by Boston.

Employee-employer relations Fortum’s business operations are developed and strengthened in good collaboration with employees� We believe that the successful management of business is built on relationships of trust between management and employees and on the active flow of information.
Fortum respects employees’ freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining� In most of our operating countries, freedom of association and collective bargaining are guaranteed by law� The exceptions to this are India, the United Arab Emirates, and the USA, which have not ratified the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) Convention on the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining� In these countries, we comply with the same practices as in other countries of operation, and we do not limit or prohibit the right to freedom of association�
We apply local collective bargaining agreements in compliance with the scope of each respective agreement in our operating countries� Collective bargaining agreements cover around 82% of Fortum’s employees in our main operating countries� There are no applicable collective bargaining agreements in, e�g�, Hungary, India, Poland, Estonia, the United Arab Emirates, and the USA� In these countries, employment contracts are based on local legislation and on the company’s human resources policies�

For the first time, Uniper SE Works Council’s Executive Committee members also participated the FEC plenary meeting as guests� In addition, local-level employeeemployer meetings are held several times a year in different countries as needed�
Several virtual meetings of the SE Works Council of Uniper SE and of the Executive Committee of the SE Works Council took place in 2021, in which representatives from Germany, the Benelux countries, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and Hungary participated.

Case | The importance of occupational healthcare services in a pandemic situation. 
Measures conducted by the occupational healthcare services have helped to ensure that there have been no closures of Fortum’s facilities due to Covid-19, thus guaranteeing a safe working environment for our employees. There have not been pandemicrelated interruptions in our energy production or challenges in maintaining process safety� Maintenance outages were, in general, also implemented as scheduled with careful planning and special measures to protect the health of our own and contractors’ employees.
The wellbeing of our employees has been increasingly supported during the Covid-19 pandemic by investing in different activities, such as virtual exercises, coaching, and coffee breaks. This has been possible through solid cooperation between different corporate functions, namely the occupational healthcare services and people function� Fortum’s leading physician in occupational health acted as a member of the global pandemic steering group and provided continuous medical updates in Covidrelated townhall meetings.
Fortum’s subsidiary Uniper has also worked actively during the pandemic to provide high-standard occupational healthcare services and support to its employees� Uniper was able to offer all employees in Germany the opportunity to be vaccinated� Vaccination centres were established at Uniper’s Düsseldorf headquarters and in the Ruhr area� More than 1,300 people received a Covid-19 vaccination via Uniper’s external company medical services, at 13 locations�
Covid-19 vaccinations for our employees in Finland In 2021, Fortum’s occupational healthcare services was one of the largest private providers of employee Covid-19 vaccinations among non-health care companies in Finland. A significant number of Covid-19 vaccinations have been provided to employees at their respective work locations – both at power plants and office sites. Earlier in the autumn, as is traditional every year, occupational healthcare services also provided vaccinations against the seasonal influenza.
Fortum’s occupational healthcare services are located at the. 
Loviisa nuclear power plant, the Riihimäki waste-to-energy plant, and the head office in Espoo. At other locations, we provide healthcare services to our employees in partnership with other healthcare operators� Our occupational healthcare services have been able to function normally throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. Healthcare services’ receptions have remained open, and statutory responsibilities, such as radiation surveys, have been taken care of in spite of the additional duties the Covid-19 pandemic has caused for occupational healthcare professionals� This has been achieved through careful planning and additional remote consultations, avoiding unnecessary human contact, and with meticulous use of face masks and high standards of hygiene� Occupational healthcare services representatives have been actively participating in the site-specific steering groups, for example in communications actions, in the practical risk management duties aimed at preventing infections, and in tracking Covid-19 infection chains� During the yearly maintenance of the Loviisa nuclear power plant, occupational healthcare services helped by carrying out case-by-case PCR testing.

Employee health and wellbeing By improving work wellbeing, we support a work environment and business culture that promotes our employees’ health, occupational safety, and the functionality of the work community. In 2021, our efforts continued to focus on safeguarding personnel from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and on supporting their physical and mental wellbeing in the exceptional conditions.
Covid-19 response Fortum and Uniper share a similar approach in protecting their employees and operations from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. At the beginning of the pandemic, coordination teams consisting of senior management were established in both companies to closely monitor the development of the pandemic and to agree on related actions. These teams continued their work in 2021.
At Fortum, excluding Uniper, the Covid-19 Task Force comprises experts from the Corporate Security, Occupational Healthcare, People Function, Corporate Communications, Corporate Risk and Compliance, Public Affairs, Corporate Procurement, and Business Technology units� The Task Force is led by the Vice President of the Security unit� Fortum Executive Management support is provided by the Senior Vice Presidents of People and of Corporate Affairs, Safety and Sustainability�
The Task Force assists Fortum’s business divisions and support functions by • Maintaining situational awareness regarding the pandemic • Following up on the requirements and recommendations issued by the local authorities in different countries • Issuing instructions for safe work arrangements at offices and sites, as well as guidance for remote working • Giving medical updates regarding testing and vaccines • Communicating best practices and lessons learnt in tackling the pandemic at the workplace. 
During the year, the Task Force organised three virtual townhall meetings with Q&A sessions for Fortum employees� In addition, nine Management Letters were sent to all Fortum managers� Information on the pandemic has also been available on the corporate intranet for all employees in six languages.
The practices taken into use to combat Covid-19 and safeguard the health of personnel at Fortum offices and sites include the requirement or recommendation, depending on guidelines given by the local authorities, to work remotely in those positions where a physical presence is not required� At sites where remote work is not possible, we have implemented special precautionary measures, such as arranging staggered arrivals, breaks and lunch hours, maintaining physical distance, encouraging the use of face masks following the guidelines of local authorities and organising enhanced cleaning� Hand disinfectants, face masks, protective gloves, and disinfectant cleaning wipes are provided at Fortum offices and sites.
Remote working remained at a high level in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, as Fortum employees were either required or recommended to work remotely in line with local guidelines set by the authorities� As of November, excluding Uniper, a hybrid work model, meaning a minimum of two days in the office environment, started in countries and locations where the pandemic situation allowed. In some offices, like at the Espoo Head Office, the hybrid work model was put on hold as the pandemic situation worsened later in the year�
The travel restrictions that had been in place since the beginning of the pandemic were lifted at the beginning of October, and business travel for a mandatory business reason, with approval from a line manager, resumed�
Fortum Group has also implemented several measures to support employees working remotely; examples include cloud-based IT solutions and HR processes that support flexible, mobile work arrangements.
Occupational safety and health care Occupational safety and health care are organised in our operating countries in line with local legislative requirements� Occupational safety committees or similar bodies represent all personnel groups, and they regularly address issues related to occupational safety and workplace wellbeing.
All our employees are within the sphere of occupational health care�
We emphasise the significance of preventive activities in promoting health and wellbeing in the company� We conduct regular medical examinations of our personnel in accordance with local laws. Employees whose work exposes them to, e.g., noise, dust, radiation, or those who perform shift work, are within the sphere of the examinations.
The percentage of sickness-related absences was 3.6 in 2021. The sickness absence rate is calculated based on the theoretical working hours� Reducing sickness-related absences is a priority for us, and we address the issue with the so-called early-support model� We increase open communication between employees and supervisors by discussing and mapping the reasons for absences� Supervisors receive training in the management of working capacity and work wellbeing�
Fortum supported vaccination programmes by providing Covid-19 vaccinations to our employees, for whom a vaccination was medically appropriate and who wished to receive one� Vaccination was started in countries where decisions by local officials made this possible; this work continues in 2022.
Wellbeing programmes and surveys Fortum, excluding Uniper, runs the Energise Your Day Wellbeing programme, which encourages employees to maintain their wellbeing and to take care of themselves� The programme offers ideas and tools for self-management, stress management, recovery, nutrition, and physical activity�
The focus areas of the programme are defined based on the employee wellbeing surveys and other wellbeing KPIs. The focus areas in 2021 were 65 SUSTAINABILITY AT FORTUM CLIMATE AND RESOURCES PERSONNEL AND SOCIETY APPENDICES PERSONNEL AND SOCIETY. 
Personnel Stakeholders Safety and security Customers Supply chain Human rights Corporate citizenship Personnel


on supporting wellbeing during the Covid-19 pandemic and on the hybrid work model� Within this scope, mental energy and physical health topics were highlighted, including, e�g�, stress management and resilience skills, ergonomics, physical activity during the workday, and managing sickness absences� Supporting managers in leading employees’ wellbeing during the challenging pandemic period was also a focus� We continued large-scale cooperation with a wellbeing service provider, which includes individual and team-level wellbeing coaching and other wellbeing services that are available to employees on a weekly basis�
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the focus was on organising and developing virtual events and services� Our employees were offered a virtual break exercise programme focused especially on remote working; the weekly Take a Break sessions had 4,300 participants. In addition, nearly one thousand employees participated in individual and team coaching sessions� In May, we organised a Stronger Together wellbeing campaign that encouraged more walking; during the campaign, our employees collected 69 million steps in total. Remote consultation with an occupational physiotherapist was available for teams and individuals�
The goal of wellbeing programmes is to improve the quality of life and performance level of the people at Fortum� We introduced a new tool for this, and more than two thousand employees, excluding Uniper, conducted the holistic wellbeing assessment� The survey gives a wide overview of the wellbeing status at the individual level but it’s also a tool for developing the wellbeing at the different levels of the organisation� The results of this survey were strong in the areas of life enjoyment, work performance, and core wellbeing at work; e.g., 76% of the respondents feel that the work they do is meaningful to them and 86% feel they can influence their work. Based on the responses, special attention should be paid to everyday activity, breaks during the day, and ergonomics� Some challenges with sleep and recovery and with mental energy topics were also identified; e.g., 39% of employees often feel tired during the day.
Fortum, excluding Uniper, conducts an annual Wellbeing Pulse Survey.
Based on the feedback, despite the exceptional year, wellbeing was at a good level. 94% of respondents feel that they are managing the mental demands of their own work role� According to the personnel, wellbeing can be further improved by, e�g�, focusing more on increasing personal energy levels after the workday. According to the survey, 28% of respondents feel that they don’t have enough energy left after the workday to do personal activities. In 2022, we will continue to pay attention to the holistic wellbeing and resilience of our employees�
Uniper’s integrated health approach offers all employees access to a wide range of services, from medical check-ups and extensive exercise programmes to mental wellbeing campaigns� Health management continued to make progress in 2021. Functional teams continued to implement actions defined in their units’ health action plans. The 2021 Voice of Uniper survey indicated high satisfaction with Uniper’s health support� The average score on the health-related questions remained stable at 89% positive in 2021, the same level as in 2020. There was a small decrease, 2 percentage points, in the responses on mental health, specifically relating to the ability to cope with the mental demands of their role during the pandemic�
Employee development Our goal is to be a forerunner in the future energy system� This means we must continuously invest in the development of leadership and personnel competence and in the support of an open and flexible corporate culture�
In 2021, special emphasis was put on supporting the managers and teams in remote and virtual working. Fortum, excluding Uniper, continued Workforce 2.0, a strategic initiative to analyse what structural long-term changes we need to implement in our ways of working� The long-term changes and scenarios will be combined with short-term adaptations and actions. The initiative continued throughout 2021 and collaborated to some extent with Uniper’s equivalent initiative called NeNo – New Normal. The Workforce 2.0 team collected data from our employees through employee pulse surveys and navigated according to employee preferences as much as possible� This eventually led to the design of the hybrid work principles in which we recommend our workforce to work and collaborate at least two days in the office and the rest of the workweek based on the team’s decision and preferences�
Flexibility is the key in the model, and we believe in collaboration and physical meetings�
The key deliveries and outcome of the Workforce 2.0 initiative were the design, launch, and implementation of Fortum’s Hybrid Work Model and the supporting Hybrid Work Handbook for the workforce� Fortum’s Hybrid Work Model implementation consisted of training and coaching more than 800 managers and employees in the hybrid work principles and in understanding how the leadership style and performance expectations are different when working partly in the office and partly remote� We offered managers a Leadership Booster Programme�
We offer our personnel a variety of online training modules� Fortum, excluding Uniper, has in place five online trainings that are mandatory for all employees� These trainings are related to the Code of Conduct, occupational safety, safety, corporate security, and privacy� Uniper has three mandatory online trainings that address compliance, data protection, and IT security�
The digital learning offering was reinforced, giving employees a wide range of possibilities to build their expertise also when working remotely. Fortum, excluding Uniper, continued developing the portfolio of online training courses, mainly in the area of Fortum Open Leadership and culture� We also created new eLearning courses in several business-related topics and introduced digital nano-learning courses on topics related to leadership training, different processes, and IT tools. The nano-learning courses take only 2–3 minutes per lesson.

Performance and development discussions We support employee development through performance management� For Fortum, excluding Uniper, all employees are within the scope of performance and development discussions� The main objective of the discussion is to ensure that the employee has clear targets that align with the business as well as the competencies supporting the achievement of the targets and professional growth� The achievement of the targets forms the basis for payment of the short-term incentive (STI)� All permanent employees who have a minimum of three months of employment in Fortum, excluding Uniper, are within the scope of Fortum’s incentive scheme. In addition, we perform so-called 360 degree assessments, which are based on Open Leadership principles, to supervisors excluding Uniper.
Performance management is an integral part of the Uniper culture, setting the direction based on the strategy and ensuring that everyone strives towards clearly defined annual objectives. Uniper has in place several targeted variable STI programmes to support the company´s annual success� Part of Uniper’s culture is to provide systematic feedback on employee performance, which promotes continuous selfreflection and improvement.
Feedback from personnel We place significant emphasis on an open and trusting corporate culture, and we highly value our employees’ feedback� Fortum, excluding Uniper, uses a real-time and flexible feedback pulse tool to track the level of employee engagement and wellbeing in the company� The global engagement survey is conducted twice a year� In addition, managers always have the possibility to conduct short surveys with a couple of questions whenever necessary� The tool allows managers and employees to see the results as soon as the feedback is given�
For Fortum, excluding Uniper, the response rate of the global engagement survey carried out in 2021 was a record high of 79%. The Total Engagement Index reached the same level as the previous year, and the results improved or stayed the same in seven out of ten areas� Compared to the previous year’s results, improvement was seen in open and honest two-way communication, trust in management’s decisions, and in decisions made without unnecessary levels of approval. 81% of employees are proud to work at Fortum and consider Fortum to be an innovative company� While these two areas scored the highest in the survey, a slight decrease was seen in both areas compared to the previous year’s results� The area that scored the lowest (56%) was collaboration between the divisions and units, although there was a slight increase compared to the previous year� We will continue measures to promote and strengthen collaboration across the organisation.
In the Voice of Uniper, an annual survey for Uniper employees excluding Unipro, employees have the opportunity to provide feedback and opinions on various topics like Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, Health and Wellbeing, and Uniper strategy and leadership� The participation rate in the 2021 survey was high at 66%.

Occupational safety targets Fortum’s safety target is measured as Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF), for own personnel and contractors, and the ambitious goal is to be below 1.0 by the end of 2025. In 2021, Fortum also had a target of 0 severe accidents and a target for Lost Time Injury Frequency (LTIF): ≤1.2.
Realisation of the safety target (LTIF, own employees and contractors combined) was a part of Fortum’s short-term incentive (STI) programme in 2021. In the 2022 STI programme, the safety target contains the severity rate per Total Recordable Injury (TRI) of own employees and contractors combined and the execution rate of safety leadership training. The safety metric (Severity rate per TRI) in the STI 2022 programme is applicable to both Fortum and Uniper� Scaling of STI metrics are company specific.
Safety performance In 2021, Fortum’s TRIF for own personnel and contractors was 2.2 (2020: 2.3), and the LTIF for own personnel and contractors was 1.5 (2020: 1.3). Unfortunately we did not meet the STI target (≤1.2) set for LTIF. In Fortum, excluding Uniper, the LTIF increased in 2021 by 12% compared to 2020 and in Uniper by 38%.
Fortum strives for zero severe occupational accidents. In 2021, there were three (2020: 1) severe occupational accidents in the operations, one resulting in a fatality� The fatally injured person was working for a contractor company to reconstruct a guardhouse at Unipro’s power plant site in Russia�
Fortum, excluding Uniper, applies three internal control points covering its EHS processes� These include the quality of the investigation process of occupational accidents, major EHS incidents, and serious near misses; the GAP index; and the Contractor Safety Improvement index, all measured on a scale of 1–5, with five indicating the highest maturity level� 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 2.2 2.3 3.1 1.5 1.3 1.7.

In 2021, Fortum’s, excluding Uniper, quality of the investigation process of occupational accidents, major EHS incidents, and serious near misses was at the very good level of 4.0 (2020: 4.0). In 2021, the GAP index was at the very good level of 4.0 (2020: 3.0). The GAP index measures how well Fortum’s, excluding Uniper, EHS minimum requirements are realised at the power plant level�
The Contractor Safety Improvement index was at the very good level of 4.0 (2020: 4.0) in 2021. This index measures how well Fortum, excluding Uniper, has managed to implement measures targeting improvements in contractor safety�
Occupational safety risk assessment and incident investigation Occupational risk management includes all levels, from strategic risks and business planning to daily work� A risk management plan is drafted on the basis of a risk assessment� Assessments and plans are made together with those working at the worksites, and they are updated at agreed intervals and when conditions change�
At Fortum, e.g. work in confined spaces, working at heights, heavy lifting work, and the handling of hazardous chemicals have been classified as high-risk work. Requirements related to, e.g., personnel training and experience, the provision of instructions, and the prejob verification to be performed have been defined for performing high-risk work.
The risk management process is developed based on continuous improvement principles and takes into consideration learnings and findings from incidents and deviations at Fortum and other companies. During incident investigations it is concluded whether the risk assessments are correct and the preventive actions sufficient.
Fortum’s incidents and findings of investigations are reported in the incident management system FRIDA. Fortum’s, excluding Uniper, learnings are shared with the organisations through digital safety bulletins. The quality of conducted investigations is verified by the divisions with quarterly process maturity assessments�
In addition, Uniper has in place the incident management system.

Occupational hygiene Fortum is expanding its business in the recycling and waste management sector including metal and battery recycling� This has subjected our operating environment to new kinds of exposure agents, like chemicals that are used in the metal recycling process�
Additionally, chemical wastes processed in hazardous waste treatment plants, and microbes related to the handling of mixed waste may adversely impact employees� For us to work safely and without harm to health, safety, or the environment, we must be aware of the risks related to exposure agents and follow best practices. Occupational hygiene risk assessments are done at the site level as a part of workplace risk assessments�
Occupational hygiene measurements are taken, if the risks cannot be evaluated otherwise. Personnel whose work could expose them to, e.g., noise or chemicals are subject to regular medical examinations. At Fortum, excluding Uniper, the corporate occupational hygienist is responsible for coordinating the work in cooperation with occupational health care� For Uniper, health managers in core countries also cover occupational hygiene-related topics�
For Fortum, excluding Uniper, the occupational hygiene work in 2021 focused particularly on supporting Fortum’s Recycling and Waste business area, especially the recently acquired metal recycling operations� During the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, an occupational hygienist is supporting business areas, the pandemic task force, and procurement, e.g. when conducting Covid-19 risk assessments, virtual safety walks, and selecting suitable certified surgical masks and respirators.
Process safety In the exceptional conditions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, Fortum’s top priorities were to ensure the health and safety of its employees and contractors and to maintain business continuity� This goal was well achieved; there were no pandemic-related interruptions in Fortum’s energy production or challenges in maintaining process safety� Maintenance outages were, in general, also implemented as scheduled with careful planning and special measures to protect the health of own and contractors’ employees� In some cases, the duration of maintenance periods was extended to reduce the number of workers on site at the same time�
Major EHS incidents are monitored, reported, and investigated regularly in Fortum’s operations, and corrective actions are implemented as required. In 2021, there were eight (2020: 16) major EHS incidents in Fortum’s operations, excluding Uniper. The major EHS incidents are reported in more detail in the4Environmental incidents section�
Dam safety Fortum is systematically reducing risks related to dam safety� A longterm programme is in place for improving the surveillance of the condition of dams and for securing the discharge capacity in extreme flood situations.
In 2021, Fortum, excluding Uniper, focused on operational issues, such as improving the cooperation with our outsourcing partner in Sweden, and managing the impacts of Covid-19 with respect to emergency preparedness. Fortum had no significant operative challenges related to dam safety in 2021, despite the Covid-19 pandemic�
Major efforts have been put into supporting the Nordic Optimisation project, in which Fortum’s and Uniper’s hydro teams are merged into one team� Actions in preparation for the “One Team” organisation launch in the first quarter of 2022 have included, e.g., updating of the Dam Safety Policy and its guiding principles, functional Dam Safety organisation, and ways of working�
During the year, we actively participated in the updating of Sweden’s dam safety guidelines (RIDAS)�
In 2021, the preparation and implementation of dam safety investments proceeded as planned. Our extensive dam safety project at the Trängslet dam in the Dalälven water system in Sweden is progressing as scheduled� The Tainionkoski dam safety project (phase 1) in Finland was finalised. During 2021, two large-scale projects were started at Forshuvud and Dejefors� The Untra dam safety project was postponed and split into two phases�
In 2022, large-scale dam safety projects totalling more than. 
EUR 3 million each are planned to be started at Letten (phase 1) in the Klarälven river system, Untra (phase 1) in the Dalälven river system, and Åtorp in the Gullspång river system�
Significant dam safety projects (>EUR 3 million) are expected to be started during 2023–2024 at the following dam sites: Lanforsen (phase 2) in the Dalälven river system, Ljusnefors in the Ljusnan river system, Gråda in the Dalälven river system, and Letten (phase 2) in the Klarälven river system. The most important goals of the projects are to bring the safety of the dams up to a good level by increasing discharge capacity and refurbishing structures and to extend the useful life of the dams.
Nuclear safety The most important task of our nuclear power operations is to produce electricity safely, reliably, and competitively, in the short and long term, while complying with the principles of nuclear and radiation safety, waste management safety, and nuclear material control� Our operations are based on a high-level safety culture and quality and on continuous improvement. Our own world-class expertise is a prerequisite for safety and competitiveness�
Loviisa nuclear power plant’s electricity production avoids about 6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere in Finland each year compared to the equivalent amount of fossil fuelbased electricity�
Fortum has submitted its Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
Report to Finland’s Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment (MEAE) in September 2021. The two primary alternatives in Fortum’s EIA process are either continuing the use of both units until about 2050 or decommissioning the nuclear power plant after the expiration of the current licenses. The operating licenses of Loviisa plant units 1 and 2 expire at the end of 2027 and at the end of 2030, respectively. This was the first time in Finland that an Environmental Impact Assessment was made for a nuclear power plant in operation� 71 SUSTAINABILITY AT FORTUM CLIMATE AND RESOURCES PERSONNEL AND SOCIETY APPENDICES PERSONNEL AND SOCIETY.

Assessment of human rights impacts and mitigation measures For Fortum, excluding Uniper, a human rights impact assessment is part of investment project planning, especially in new operating countries� It is also part of a country and counterparty risk assessment� Depending on the project, we either assess risks based on public sources or we conduct a more in-depth assessment� The public information sources considered in country risk assessments include the ILO conventions and their ratification, Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index, the UN Human Development Index, the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators, and human rights reports issued by human rights organisations and states� An assessment based on public sources is always completed for all new countries to which one of our business units is planning to sell products or services. In 2021, we performed two such assessments� For investment projects targeting risk countries, we perform an in-depth assessment in which we often also use external local experts. As there were no new investment projects targeted in risk countries, no in-depth assessments were carried out in 2021.
Fortum, excluding Uniper, defines measures for projects to manage human rights risks, in order to comply with our own policies and requirements and, e.g., with lender requirements. Examples of measures include attaching specific contract clauses in joint venture agreements or purchase contracts, paying special attention to Code of Conduct implementation and safety training of personnel and contractors, and consultations with local communities� We also aim to support favourable impacts in collaboration with local communities and other stakeholders. In India, for example, we have implemented community projects, which are described in the section4Corporate citizenship�
On an annual basis, Uniper performs a worldwide assessment, which is based on a combination of economic and social indexes, to map key potential country-specific issues, such as working conditions, violation of political rights and civil liberties, as well as security threats, that may directly affect Uniper. The assessment’s findings resulted in the implementation of modified due diligence requirements and mitigation measures, such as the inclusion of specific contract clauses, particularly when negotiating with new counterparties operating in medium- or high-risk countries�
In 2021, Uniper launched a project to develop central coordination of due diligence processes and human right risk assessments� One of the key tasks of the project is to identify improvement areas across existing processes.

COP 26 agreements, Uniper has developed master plans for all coal sites scheduled for closure� These aim to ensure a responsible and fair transition from coal to a greener economy� The principles consider, amongst others, support for workers in the transition to new jobs and the promotion of social dialogue and stakeholder engagement�
Fortum addresses the topic of just transition in the supply chain, e�g�, in our work with the Bettercoal initiative� Climate protection policies and the resulting changes in the demand for and production of coal will significantly impact employment, the economy, and public revenues in coal mining regions� Bettercoal works with stakeholders (government, companies, trade unions, and local communities) to support the transition of Colombian mining regions towards a more diversified local economy and to reduce the potential negative impacts of a decline in coal demand�
An element of just transition is also the affordable and reliable supply of energy to societies� This is addressed in the section4Energy�
Modern Slavery Statements Fortum’s and Uniper’s UK subsidiaries annually publish a Modern Slavery Statement, as required by the Modern Slavery Act� Fortum’s statement is available on Fortum's4website� Respectively, the Modern Slavery Statement of Uniper’s UK subsidiaries can be found on Uniper’s 4website� The statements set out the steps that the companies have taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking are not taking place in any of their supply chains or in any part of their own business� 75 SUSTAINABILITY AT FORTUM CLIMATE AND RESOURCES PERSONNEL AND SOCIETY APPENDICES PERSONNEL AND SOCIETY.

Reputation Fortum’s, excluding Uniper, annual reputation study One Fortum Survey conducted in 2021 shows that Fortum’s reputation decreased slightly among most stakeholder groups compared to the 2020 results. Fortum’s reputation is strongest among our own employees with a reputation index score of 80 (2020: 82) on a scale 0–100. Reputation among decision makers stayed on a very good level at 76 (2020: 77). Among capital market representatives the score was on a good level at 74 (2020: 76). Reputation among media representatives decreased slightly to 69 (2020: 73). Among NGOs the result remained stable at 68 (2020: 68). We continued to have the weakest reputation among the general public, with a score of 56 (2020: 60).
The stakeholders jointly feel that Fortum’s strength in terms of reputation is connected to its operations – competent employees, high reliability, and safe production� On the other hand the study indicates that we have most room for improvement in terms of climate, environment, and social responsibility� Our stakeholders are to some extent worried about our ambition and ability to reduce emissions in line with our targets, with a special concern around our assets in Russia� They also feel that Fortum could offer more support to the local communities in places we operate� As a new feature in the survey, we also inquired about the awareness of and thoughts on Fortum’s updated strategy among stakeholders� Many of the responses were positive saying that we are on the right track and in a good position to execute our strategy. However, the responses also showed that some stakeholders have rather low awareness of the strategy and understanding where the company is heading�
The target for Fortum’s reputation, excluding Uniper, in 2021 was ≥72.5 in the One Fortum Survey, measured as the average rating by all stakeholders included in the survey� The target was not reached but the average reputation index score was 70.5 (2020: 72.5).

The Market Court rendered its decision, in which it provided clarity on the interpretation and returned the case to be re-decided by the Energy Authority. The Energy Authority is expected to give their decision at the beginning of 2022. In addition, Fortum has received certain inquiries from the Consumer Dispute Board regarding a couple of complaints received from specific consumers. Fortum has replied to these inquiries� The cases are still pending in the Consumer Dispute Board, waiting for the final decisions.

Case | Cooperation in nuclear decommissioning and dismantling services. 
In 2021, Fortum and Uniper entered into close cooperation to offer nuclear decommissioning and dismantling services for nuclear sector� Through this cooperation, Fortum and Uniper combine decades of nuclear experience and a wide variety of competencies, creating world-class value to customers�
Nuclear power plants around Europe are in different phases of their life cycle� At the same time, as new reactors are being planned and built, there are also plants that will be decommissioned and dismantled�
Uniper is developing strong decommissioning competencies and has a unique reference with their decommissioning programme in Sweden� Fortum brings to the cooperation complementary competencies in the waste and decommissioning area, as well as a customer-centric way of working� Fortum’s Nuclear Services business has served customers for many years with excellent customer satisfaction results.
Essential for energy transition The cooperation is initially focused on the on-going decommissioning and dismantling of four reactors in Uniper’s Swedish nuclear power fleet in a safe and efficient manner. These are Barsebäck units 1 and 2, and Oskarshamn units 1 and 2, which are co-owned by Fortum and Uniper� The four reactors are integrated into a common decommissioning portfolio to create logistical and economic coordination benefits.
Looking ahead and into the European decommissioning market together is a natural next step. It will also enable Fortum Group to retain nuclear competence in each country and offer nuclear experts long-term career and development opportunities. Performing cost-efficient decommissioning gives legitimacy to a new generation of nuclear power that supports and is essential for efficient decarbonisation and the energy transition.

All our Consumer Solutions customers are given the option of including a sustainability-themed value-adding service as an add-on to their electricity contract� With funds accrued through the value-adding service, we support the “Good Cause Partners” that are aligned with our Corporate Social Responsibility strategy, such as the4Rainforest Foundation, 4John Nurminen Foundation, 4Håll Sverige Rent and4Water Aid� The level of support is based on the volume of customers choosing to purchase the value-adding service�
Local impacts We are an important employer and significant tax payer in our operating areas� In addition, our investments improve the local infrastructure�
Among our energy production forms, hydropower, e�g�, impacts local communities and local land use� Hydropower construction and use may alter the fluctuation range and rhythm in the discharge and water level in waterways as well as the fish populations. These changes impact fishing, recreational use, and boating. We mitigate and compensate the adversities caused by hydropower production through numerous measures, such as stocking fish and building boat launch ramps.
We communicate openly, honestly, and proactively, and we engage in a dialogue with the stakeholder groups located in the vicinity of our power plants� We carry out collaboration projects with local communities� We conduct environmental impact assessments (EIA) for our projects in accordance with legislative requirements� A hearing of stakeholders is part of the EIA process� In addition, relevant stakeholders are heard in all permit procedures�
Examples of city collaboration We continued publishing the Naapurina ydinvoimala (Nuclear power plant as a neighbour) magazine in Loviisa, Finland, and maintained active dialogue with local residents and Loviisa city representatives� We engage with local decision-makers, associations, and residents in Riihimäki and Hausjärvi through, e�g�, collaboration meetings that.

Case | Fortum collaborated with Miljøagentene to teach children in Norway about renewable energy. 
In 2021, Fortum collaborated with the children’s environmental organisation called Miljøagentene (The Eco-Agents) to develop De Grønne Forskerspirene (The Green Researchers), a teaching programme for all third-graders in Norway� During the programme, around 10,600 children in the participating 475 school classes carried out fun experiments and learned about renewable energy. The children were also provided with practical guidelines for additional voluntary experiments to be done at home. The goal of the programme was to give the children a passion for research and environmental commitment and to show how new technology and renewable energy can contribute to solving climate challenges�
The third-graders completed different experiments and competed with other school classes� At the end of the competition, three winners were chosen and each received EUR 500 for their classes.
According to Fortum’s representatives in the project, “Miljøagentene gives insight into energy on the children’s terms� The 8-year-olds have researched the mysteries of energy and have thus become more energy-smart than many adults� We’re happy to continue and further develop the collaboration in 2022�”
The impact of the programme was measured through a survey of participating teachers. The result showed that 95% were happy with the project, 96% noted that the project increased knowledge on renewable energy, and 86% thought that the project increased children’s engagement in climate and environmental topics�
Fortum supported Miljøagentene financially, but also contributed to the teaching programme�
Feedback from Miljøagentene: “Through De Grønne Forskerspirene we have been able to give the third-graders a unique understanding of what energy actually is. The classes have reported back that it has been both fun and exciting to be a part of the competition. Hopefully we have inspired them to lifelong environmental engagement.”
Miljøagentene’s aim is to stimulate the children’s interest and love for nature and to help them realise that the way we live our lives impacts the environment� Miljøagentene has more than 10,000 members and 59 local groups all over Norway.

Supply chain. 
Fortum is a significant purchaser of goods and services. Suppliers are an important part of a successful business� Through responsible supplier selections and close collaboration with our partners we support the achievement of sustainability targets�
Purchases and supply chains Fortum’s total purchasing volume in 2021 was EUR 99.5 billion (2020: 42.8). Main reason for the increase is the rise in commodity prices. Large part of the purchasing volume is related to our business as an energy merchant, we purchase energy commodities and sell them to end-users and resellers� The rest of the purchases consist of fuels, investments, and other goods and services related to operation and maintenance as well as to other functions, such as IT solutions, marketing, and consulting�
Over half, i.e. about 62% (2020: 64%), of the purchasing volume, excluding Uniper, was purchased from suppliers operating in Europe, mostly in Finland, Sweden, and Norway� This does not include electricity purchased from the Nordic wholesale market�
About 40% (2020: 35%) of Fortum’s purchases, excluding Uniper, were from risk countries� The majority of these purchases were from Russia� Violations related to work conditions and human rights are more likely in risk countries than in non-risk countries� Fortum’s risk-country classification is based on the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators and ILO’s Country profiles. The risk-country list was last updated in 2022.
In 2021, Fortum, excluding Uniper, had about 12,000 (2020: 13,000) suppliers of goods and services. About 1,500 (2020: 1,300) of these suppliers were in risk countries. Excluding the Russia Division’s local suppliers, there were about 500 (2020: 300) suppliers in risk countries.
Fortum and Uniper continued cooperation in procurement to identify and implement synergy benefits for both companies. We have, e�g�, developed common spend visibility solutions, conducted joint procurement cases, and supported the One Team strategic cooperation areas of Nordic hydropower, physical trading optimisation, wind and solar development, and hydrogen�
For the time being, both companies continue to use their own procurement systems, and therefore fully consolidated figures for specific areas, e.g. purchasing countries, are not yet available. Information on Uniper’s approach to analysing country risks in supply chains can be found in the section4Human rights�
Fuel purchasing The most significant environmental impacts of our supply chain are related mainly to fuels, particularly to coal, natural gas, and biomasses� Among the significant environmental aspects associated with coal mining and natural gas production are the use of natural resources, greenhouse gas and other emissions to air, water and soil, and impacts on biodiversity� In both industries, occupational health and safety of personnel is a significant social aspect. The sustainability aspects of biomass sourcing are related primarily to biodiversity, but in risk countries can also include, for instance, illegal logging or human rights violations� In fuel purchasing, special attention is paid to the origin of the fuel and to responsible production� Information about the fuel use at Fortum Group can be found in the section4Energy. The most significant countries of origin of the main fuels are presented in the table.

Natural gas Uniper is actively working to make the energy supply more secure by driving further diversification of the company’s gas procurement sources� To support this and to help meet the predicted growing demand for gas, Uniper is expanding its LNG business and is currently looking at the potential of building an LNG terminal in Wilhelmshaven in Germany.
Uniper has worked with strategic gas suppliers to mitigate ESG risks along the value chain, focusing especially on greenhouse gas (GHG) emission transparency, including methane monitoring� Although gas molecules are inherently not fully traceable, there are increasing opportunities to minimise and offset the estimated GHG emissions from gas and LNG transportation�
In 2020, Uniper became a member of the Oil and Gas Methane. 
Partnership (OGMP) 2.0, a voluntary initiative to help oil and gas companies report and reduce methane emissions, foster transparency, and share best practices� Its aim is for the industry as a whole to reduce its methane emissions by 45% by 2025. Promoted by the European Commission and various NGOs, OGMP 2.0 fosters industrywide collaboration, including with strategic upstream suppliers�
In 2021, OGMP recognised Uniper Energy Storage’s methane reporting as the “gold standard”, which is the highest level of reporting requirements set by OGMP. In October 2021, Uniper joined fourteen European gas infrastructure operators and gas associations in a project led by the European Gas Research Group (GERG) and gas grid operator Enagás� The project’s purpose is to improve and deploy new technologies to curb methane emissions in midstream gas infrastructure.
Coal Both Fortum and Uniper are members of the Bettercoal initiative and use Bettercoal tools to improve sustainability in the coal supply chain� At year-end 2021, Fortum Group’s coal volume purchased via direct contract from Bettercoal suppliers was 67%.

Fortum, excluding Uniper, has published the names of its significant coal suppliers on its4website� We are actively working towards diversification of our coal procurement sources to our power plants in Europe to improve the security of supply�
Uranium The fuel assemblies used at the Loviisa nuclear power plant in Finland are of Russian origin� The fuel supplier acquires the uranium used in the fuel assemblies from Russian mines in accordance with Fortum’s agreement� In 2021, the uranium originated from the Krasnokamensk, Khiagda, and Dalur mines. All three uranium mines have ISO 14001 environmental certification. ARMZ Uranium Holding Co., a uranium producer, and TVEL, the company responsible for refining and manufacturing the uranium, have certified environmental and occupational safety systems in place in all their plants, as do the plants manufacturing zirconium material, uranium oxide pellets, and fuel assemblies. Additionally, TVEL’s conversion and enrichment plants have in place a certified system for energy management� We regularly assess the quality, environmental, and occupational health and safety management systems of our nuclear fuel suppliers and the manufacturing of nuclear fuel assemblies, and we visit the suppliers on an annual basis. However, this was not possible in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We secure the supply of nuclear fuel in Loviisa by stocking enough fuel reserves and by evaluating alternative sources of supply.
Uniper operates the Oskarshamn nuclear power plant (OKG) in. 
Sweden. OKG has contracts with several suppliers of uranium. In 2021, the uranium was purchased from Kazakhstan. The environmental requirements OKG places on uranium suppliers are very extensive, and the company conducts its own audits at every step in the fuel chain. OKG evaluates and reviews the suppliers based on aspects such as environment, health, and quality� Evaluations are supported by visiting the mines and production plants and by meeting with local stakeholders. Certifications, such as ISO 9001 and ISO 14001, are also taken into account, and suppliers are encouraged to continuously improve their operations.
Biomass In 2021, nearly 86% of the wood-based biomass fuel purchased by Fortum Group originated from certified sources; certified woodbased biomass fuel originates from sustainably managed forests� This percentage excludes biomass purchases in the Baltic countries, where Fortum completed the sale of its power plants in July 2021.
The biofuel sustainability criteria defined in the EU Renewable Energy. 
Directive (RED II) in 2018 are being implemented by EU member states. In the context of the Fit for 55 package that revises all EU climate legislation, the EU Commission proposes to tighten the sustainability criteria for biomass, e�g�, by introducing a cascading principle for biomass use� Fortum is closely following the development of the regulation and guidelines set by national authorities and is prepared to implement the required additions to our current biomass sourcing processes.
Waste-derived fuel Fortum uses waste-derived fuels at waste-to-energy plants in Klemetsrud, Norway; Riihimäki, Finland; Nyborg, Denmark; Kumla, Sweden, and Zabrze, Poland. The fuel used in 2021 was mainly locally collected municipal and industrial waste�
Supply chain management Fortum and Uniper expect their business partners to act responsibly and to comply with the requirements set forth in their respective Codes of Conduct and Supplier Codes of Conduct� The key tools in supply chain management for both companies are counterparty risk assessments, supplier qualifications and supplier audits.
Codes of Conduct cover basic requirements The Fortum Code of Conduct and Uniper Code of Conduct are based on similar fundaments, and they establish the basic principles of conduct that everyone must follow. They define how we treat each other, do business, and engage with the world� The Supplier Codes of Conduct, both based on the ten principles of the UN Global Compact, outline the requirements for Fortum’s and Uniper’s suppliers and business partners�
The Fortum Supplier Code of Conduct is included in purchase agreements with a contract value of EUR 100,000 or more. Uniper’s standard supplier agreements require suppliers to comply with Uniper’s Supplier Code of Conduct� Both companies reserve the right to monitor whether their suppliers observe the Supplier Codes of Conduct by requesting information and conducting on-site audits� Suppliers who fail to observe the Supplier Codes of Conduct are expected to take immediate corrective action, and both companies reserve the right to terminate relationships with suppliers who cannot demonstrate adherence to the Codes of Conduct�
Supplier qualification Fortum, excluding Uniper, requires suppliers to complete a supplier qualification process, when the contract value is EUR 100,000 or more. In the qualification process, we determine and assess, among other things, the supplier’s possible operations in risk countries, certified management systems, and the occupational safety performance of the contractors� We also pay special attention to anti-corruption practices. In 2021, we strengthened the questions related to the prohibition of forced labor�
In January 2022, we added to the supplier qualification questionnaire a new mandatory question related to the respondent’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. When potential risks are identified, the supplier is asked to provide more information or a supplier audit is performed� Depending on the supplier’s responses, we may continue the qualification process, impose corrective actions, or decide not to qualify the supplier. Once completed, the qualification is valid for three years. At the end of 2021, 81% (2020: 77%) of Fortum’s purchasing volume, excluding Russia Division and Uniper, came from qualified suppliers.
Fortum’s Russia Division uses its own supplier qualification process that is based on Russian procurement law� In the Russian operations, we set supplier requirements for business principles, ethics, environmental management, and occupational health and safety practices� Uniper applies its own supplier qualification process for suppliers with a significant expected annual purchase volume or those that have been identified as having a high or medium health and safety risk.

Uniper’s and Fortum’s qualification processes follows similar principles and steps� Uniper has set a target of using the ESG screening process to assess 100% of all material counterparties within the scope of Uniper’s procurement policies by 2022. At the end of 2021, 59% of them had been assessed� In addition, Uniper applies its own processes for Know Your Counterparty.
Supplier sustainability audits In supplier sustainability audits, Fortum, excluding Uniper, assesses the supplier’s compliance with the requirements in Fortum’s Supplier Code of Conduct� Audits are done on-site, and they include site inspections, management and employee interviews, and reviews of documents�
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic and travel restrictions, the possibilities to conduct on-site supplier audits have been limited since the year 2020. Consequently, Fortum, excluding Uniper, conducted a total of four on-site audits in India and China during 2021.
If non-compliances are found in audits, the supplier makes a plan for corrective actions and we monitor their implementation� In case of severe non-compliances, the supplier can be qualified or the cooperation can be continued only if the corrective actions are implemented and confirmed. Fortum uses an international service provider for conducting audits, especially in risk countries� In Fortum’s main operating countries, or in the case of remote audits, the audits are performed by own personnel. In 2021, no audits conducted by own personnel were carried out�
In 2021, the majority of the non-compliances identified in the audits were related to overtime hours, pay, and occupational safety� No severe non-compliances related to freedom of association and employee collective bargaining rights, child labour, or discrimination were identified. One supplier was issued a recommendation related to employment contracts to strengthen its practices for the prohibition of forced labor�
Bettercoal Fortum and Uniper are members of the Bettercoal initiative and use the Bettercoal Code and tools to monitor and improve sustainability in the coal supply chain� The Bettercoal Assessment Programme includes the suppliers’ Letter of Commitment, self-assessment, and site-assessment� Site-assessment is based on the principles of the Bettercoal Code and covers legal compliance, sustainability policies and management systems, business ethics, human rights and social performance, and environmental performance� The Bettercoal Code was renewed during 2020, and the revised Code was published in March 2021. Based on the site-assessment, a continuous improvement plan is drafted for the suppliers, and its implementation is monitored regularly� Site assessments are always performed by an external assessor approved by Bettercoal. In 2021, no Bettercoal site-assessments were conducted, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. All coal suppliers participating in the Bettercoal programme and their status in the assessment process are listed on the4Bettercoal website�
Bettercoal has established working groups to support its operations in two significant coal procurement countries: Russia and Colombia. The purpose of the working groups is to support the continuous improvement of the suppliers participating in the Bettercoal Assessment Programme and to increase the number of suppliers participating in the programme, identify country risks and find ways to address them, and improve communications between the different stakeholders� Both Fortum and Uniper participate in the Russia and Colombia working groups’ activities, and Uniper chairs the Colombia working group�
Despite the limitations imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic, the. 
Bettercoal Russia working group continued its stakeholder engagement activities in 2021. It conducted two virtual conferences on mine closure and land restoration, health and safety, and environmental monitoring�
Bettercoal Colombia working group continued to implement its work programme in 2021. The working group continued to monitor the three major Colombian coal mining companies’ continuous improvement plans and to actively engage with stakeholders� In an online event, the group met with relevant Colombian stakeholders, including suppliers, governmental agencies, dialogue institutions, NGOs, and trade unions� The working group exchanged prioritised issues in the work plan, identified opportunities for specific actions where Bettercoal can have a positive impact in the region, and addressed other issues relevant in the Colombian mining context.
Climate protection policies and the resulting changes in the demand for and production of coal will significantly impact employment, the economy, and public revenues in Columbia’s coal mining regions� Bettercoal works with stakeholders (government, companies, trade unions, and local communities) to support the transition in mining regions from coal mining dominance towards a more diversified local economy and to reduce the negative impact of a declined coal demand.

Fortum’s goal is a high level of environmental and safety management in all business activities� Calculated in terms of sales, 100% of Fortum’s electricity and heat production operations at the end of 2021 were ISO 14001 environmentally certified and 99.3% were ISO 45001 safety-certified. The divisions and sites develop their operations with internal and external audits required by environmental, occupational safety and quality management systems.
Responsibilities As sustainability is an integral part of Fortum’s strategy, the highest decision-making on sustainability and climate-related matters falls within the duties of the members of the Board of Directors, who share joint responsibility in these matters� Therefore, Fortum has not established a specific Sustainability Committee for the decision making on economic, environmental and social matters� The Audit and Risk Committee, members of the Fortum Executive Management, and other senior executives support the Board of Directors in the decision-making in these matters, when necessary�
Fortum Executive Management decides on the sustainability approach and Group-level sustainability targets that guide annual planning� The Group’s performance targets, including sustainability and climate-related targets, are approved by Fortum’s Board of Directors� Fortum Executive Management monitors the achievement of the targets in its monthly meetings and in quarterly performance reviews� The achievement of the targets is also regularly reported to Fortum’s Board of Directors� Fortum’s line management is responsible for the implementation of Fortum Group’s policies and instructions and for dayto-day sustainability management and improvement plans�
Fortum’s Corporate Sustainability unit is responsible for the coordination and development of sustainability at the Group-level and for maintaining an adequate situation awareness and oversight regarding sustainability�
Fortum’s subsidiary Uniper remains a separate company, listed in Germany, and has its own sustainability governance, processes and reporting� The Uniper SE Management Board bears the overall responsibility for the adoption and implementation of Uniper’s sustainability measures� Uniper’s highest governance board, the Supervisory Board, monitors the fulfilment of Uniper’s sustainability obligations. Four of Fortum’s Executive Managers, including the President and CEO of Fortum are members of Uniper’s Supervisory Board� The President and CEO of Fortum act as the Chairman of Uniper SE Supervisory Board� New candidates will be nominated for election at the Uniper AGM, to be held in May 2022.
Realisation of the safety target (LTIF, own employees and contractors combined) was a part of Fortum’s short-term incentive (STI) programme in 2021. In the 2022 STI programme, the safety target contains the severity rate per Total Recordable Injuries (TRI) of own employees and contractors combined and the execution rate of safety leadership training� Fortum’s long-term incentive (LTI) programme includes a climate-related metric. In the 2021–2023 LTI plan, the target is linked to the reduction of coal-fired power generation capacity in line with. 
Fortum’s coal-exit path. In the 2022–2024 LTI plan, the target is related to the reduction of absolute CO2 emissions in the European fossil fleet, based on a fossil fleet review addressing the Group’s European generation portfolio and a pathway developed to reach Fortum Group’s 2030 and 2035 climate targets. Uniper continues to follow its own STI and LTI plans� However, the safety metric (severity rate per TRI) in the STI 2022 programme and the climate-related metric in the 2022–2024 LTI plan are applicable to both companies� Scaling of STI and LTI metrics are company-specific.

Management of economic responsibility. 
Description. 
Targets and approach For Fortum, economic responsibility means competitiveness, performance excellence and market-driven production that creates long-term value for our stakeholders and enables sustainable growth. Satisfied customers are key to our success, and active consumers will have a crucial role in the future energy system� Fortum has indirect responsibility for its supply chain� We conduct business with companies that act responsibly�
Each new research and development project is assessed against the criteria of carbon dioxide emissions reduction and resource efficiency. Likewise, new investment proposals are assessed against sustainability criteria as part of Fortum’s investment assessment and approval process� In our investments, we seek economically profitable alternatives that provide the opportunity to increase capacity and reduce emissions�
Our financial targets include a target for capital structure (financial net debt / comparable EBITDA below 2x) and two different hurdle rates for new investments (WACC +100 BPS for green investments and WACC +200 BPS for other investments)� Accordingly, Fortum aims to provide good returns for its owners and its dividend policy stipulates to pay a stable, sustainable and overtime increasing dividend. The realisation of financial targets in 2021 is reported in the Financial performance and position section of the 4Financials 2021�
Policies and commitments The financial management system is based on Group-level policies and their specifying instructions, and on good governance, effective risk management, sufficient controls and the internal audit principles supporting them. Other key elements steering financial management are presented in the section4Policies and commitments�
Responsibilities The CFO and the Group’s Financial unit, division management, and ultimately the CEO and the Board of Directors are responsible for issues related to finances and financial statements and for broader financial responsibility issues. Our sustainability responsibilities are presented in the section4Governance and management�
Monitoring and follow-up The Board decides on the company’s financial targets as a part of the annual business planning process� Realisation of the targets is monitored on monthly basis both at the division level and by Fortum Executive Management. Fortum’s management monitors the realisation of financial targets quarterly as part of the business performance assessment, and key indicators are regularly reported to Fortum’s Board of Directors� Financial key indicators related to investments are monitored in divisions’ investment forums and by Fortum Executive Management�
We report regularly on the direct and indirect financial impacts on our most important stakeholder groups� Fortum also uses the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards indicators to measure economic responsibility�
Management of environmental responsibility. 
Description. 
Targets and approach Fortum wants to enable the energy transition by providing customers and societies a reliable and affordable supply of low-carbon energy. In the future, the energy system – and Fortum’s portfolio – will be based on renewable energy, increasingly clean gas (e.g. hydrogen) and nuclear power� In addition, we will continue to offer industrial and infrastructure solutions, e�g�, waste-to-energy, grid stability services, as well as energy sales and storage� We strive to continuously reduce the environmental impacts of our operations by using best available practices and technologies� We measure the realisation of the environmental responsibility with the following key performance indicators, for which we have set4Group-level targets: • CO2 emissions reduction (Scope 1 and 2) in European generation by at least 50% by 2030, and carbon neutral (Scope 1 and 2) in European generation by 2035 at the latest • Carbon neutral globally (Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions), in line with the goals of the Paris. 
Agreement, by 2050 at the latest • 35% reduction in Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 at the latest • Number of major voluntary measures enhancing biodiversity ≥12 in 2021.

Responsibilities Our sustainability responsibilities are presented in the section4Governance and management�
Monitoring and follow-up The Group’s key indicators are reported regularly to Fortum’s Board of Directors and are published in Fortum’s interim reports. Carbon dioxide emissions and specific CO2 emissions are reported quarterly, and number of major voluntary measures enchancing biodiversity is reported annually (in 2021) to Fortum Executive Management.
The divisions and sites follow and develop their operations with audits required by environmental management systems. Internal and external auditors regularly audit the ISO 14001 standard-compliant management system� The CO2 emissions of plants within the sphere of the EU and the UK emissions trading system (ETS) are audited annually on a per plant basis by an external verifier accredited by the emissions trading authority. The verification addresses the reliability, credibility and accuracy of the monitoring system and the reported data and information relating to CO2 emissions� The plants must annually submit to the authorities a verified emissions report of the previous calendar year’s CO2 emissions� 4Independent limited assurance on Fortum’s Greenhouse gas emissions in 2021 has been provided by Deloitte Oy�
Fortum’s and Uniper’s supply chain monitoring systems also cover environmental responsibility� The approach is described in the section4Personnel and society: Supply chain�

A limited assurance engagement with respect to the GHG Emissions. 
Disclosures involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the reported GHG Emissions� The procedures performed depend on the practitioner’s judgment, but their nature is different from, and their extent is less than, a reasonable assurance engagement. It does not include detailed testing of source data or the operating effectiveness of processes and internal controls and consequently they do not enable us to obtain the assurance necessary to become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement.
Our procedures on this engagement included: • A review of management systems, reporting and data compilation processes related to the calculations presented on pages 38 and 39 in the Fortum’s Sustainability Reporting 2021.
• Selected interviews of persons conducting Scope 1, 2 and 3 analysis and data owners • Review of assumptions and emission factors used in calculations • Analytical testing of consolidated data • Testing of source data on spot check basis. 
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion�
Our independence, quality control and competences We complied with Deloitte’s independence policies which address and, in certain cases, exceed the requirements of the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants in their role as independent assurance providers and in particular preclude us from taking financial, commercial, governance and ownership positions which might affect, or be perceived to affect, our independence and impartiality and from any involvement in the preparation of the report� We have maintained our independence and objectivity throughout the year and there were no events or prohibited services provided which could impair our independence and objectivity�
Deloitte Oy applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements� This engagement was conducted by a multidisciplinary team including assurance and GHG Reporting expertise with professional qualifications. Our team is experienced in providing reporting assurance�
Conclusion On the basis of the procedures we have performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the information subject to the assurance engagement is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting criteria�
Our assurance statement should be read in conjunction with the inherent limitations of accuracy and completeness of the GHG Reporting.
