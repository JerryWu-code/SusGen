Sustainability Report 2020


Dear Stakeholders,
We are honored to present NOVATEK’s 14th Sustainability Report 2020, providing insights to our non-financial disclosures to help a wide range of stakeholders learn more about the NOVATEK’s sustainable business principles and the Company’s economic, environmental and social performance.
Despite the fact that 2020 was marked by various unprecedented economic and societal challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, NOVATEK maintained its commitment to creating long-term value for all stakeholders, and once again confirmed our status as a responsible employer and business partner, implementing projects and initiatives to protect the environment and develop local communities.
During this period of uncertainty and market instability, we remained committed to ensure the health and safety of our employees and their families, as well as our contractors and suppliers. NOVATEK worked closely with federal, regional and local authorities, as well as with our partners, to contain the spread of the coronavirus, and took appropriate measures, where necessary, to minimize possible disruptions in our production output, and to ensure the stability of our business activities. Since the onset of the COVID pandemic, we paid RR 4.8 billion on the implementation of anti-epidemic measures including regional and local support.
The key pillars of our Corporate Strategy issued in 2017 were primarily based on the global shift to low-carbon economies and the role of natural gas in the future energy mix considering climate change initiatives. Our strategic vision on LNG and its major role in answering three fundamental questions on energy affordability, energy security and energy sustainability proved to be correct. The climate change debate is a major global challenge that require full international cooperation to address the issue of decarbonizing society. NOVATEK will play a major role in reducing the negative impacts caused by carbon emissions as our business activities are aligned to react dynamically to these changing issues in a socially and environmentally responsible manner.
NOVATEK’s participation in building a low-carbon future is consistent with the goals established by the Paris Climate Agreement. We will address climate actions on many fronts, including lowering our own carbon emissions and helping customers reduce their CO2 emissions by expanding lower-carbon products and providing cleaner energy. We firmly believe that our low-carbon strategy offers us a strong competitive advantage relative to our peers, as well as creates economic and societal value for all our stakeholders.
In 2020, we adopted the corporate theme “THINK GREEN. THINK NATURAL GAS.”. We felt this statement best reflects the core nature of our business as a major natural gas producer and redefines our intention to producing and delivering clean-burning natural gas via low-carbon LNG.
We remain fully committed to deliver up to 70 million tons of LNG by 2030 according to our corporate strategy and believe that long-term LNG demand will remain robust even under any of the net zero carbon scenarios, with the largest demand growth coming from the Asia Pacific markets. The pathway forward for NOVATEK to assist countries in pursuing their net zero targets and transition from coal-fired generation is through delivering natural gas.
Natural gas will play a leading role in the energy transition towards a low-carbon society for many decades, providing stability and reliability to the electricity power grids as well as ensuring affordable energy for a growing population. Denying the development of natural gas will negatively impact the 4+ billion people trying to raise their standards of living in the emerging markets. Fossil fuels has been the foundation for society’s advancement over the past century, leading to profound changes in economic growth and the creation of modern societies. We should not lose sight of this fact, and instead, be proud of the industry’s contributions to this economic reality.
One of NOVATEK key advantages is in its ability to control the full LNG value chain, from upstream to endcustomer delivery; hence, we are well positioned to monitor, verify and deliver “Green LNG” cargos to the market. NOVATEK’s core strategy as a natural gas and LNG producer implies greater involvement in developing natural gas as a transport fuel both in Russia and abroad. This market segment represents significant incremental growth potential in the context of increasingly stringent environmental standards.
In 2020, we made advancements in both market directions. Last year, our first small-scale LNG plant of 40 thousand tons per annum was launched in the Chelyabinsk Region to create incremental, environmentally friendly gas demand for the transport sector. We also successfully launched our first carbon-neutral LNG fueling station in Germany. Carbon neutral offsets from a carefully selected portfolio of emission reduction projects, including wind generation projects in developing countries, are used to compensate for the LNG’s carbon footprint sold to end-customers.
NOVATEK is one of the leaders in the global oil and gas industry in terms of carbon efficiency due to our high share of natural gas in the production mix. Our carbon intensity per 295.1 kg of CO2e/boe is below the global average and represents one of the lowest levels of GHG emissions among oil and gas companies, both domestically and internationally. Our LNG production is one of the cleanest among LNG projects globally at 0.24 tons of CO2e/ton of LNG produced. We intend to sustain these leading positions going forward by introducing lowcarbon solutions into our operations.
In 2020, NOVATEK’s Board of Directors approved the Company’s Environmental and Climate Change targets for the period up to 2030, and we believe our goals are reasonable and reflect our low GHG emissions intensity level. NOVATEK will positively contribute to lower our emissions targets as our growing LNG and natural gas platform is one of the cleanest globally.
Last year, we implemented new APG technology to inject the associated gas into the deeper absorbing geological horizons at the Yarudeyskoye field. The Company makes every effort to ensure the rational APG utilization and this development achieved a significant positive environmental effect by reducing 1.2 million tons of CO2 equivalent into the atmosphere and allowed us to achieve a 96.2% APG utilization rate for the whole Company.
Moreover, we are studying the possibilities to expand low-carbon energy by producing ammonia and hydrogen, combined with carbon capture and storage technology. We will also use hydrogen as a fuel mix with natural gas and we are working with our strategic partners to further lower our carbon footprint, especially in our strategic LNG business. We signed cooperation agreements with leading global companies aimed at reducing GHG emissions and increasing our environmental efficiency.
In 2020, NOVATEK joined the Methane Guiding Principles Initiative, a voluntary, international multi-stakeholder partnership between industry and non-industry organizations with a focus on priority areas for action along the natural gas value chain. The Company joined international oil and gas industry leaders and global supporting organizations to achieve a goal to continually reduce methane emissions within business activities, increase transparency and implement regulations on methane emissions.
Today, the oil and gas industry is under severe pressure from many constituent groups, especially regulators with their latest comments about instituting carbon taxes or restricting fossil fuel usage. In our opinion, forcing a change through the regulatory process will not solve the climate change agenda. We must all look seriously at the full cause of carbon emissions globally. The consumption of carbon intensive goods are one of the leading causes of carbon emissions globally and addressing this question from only the producers’ side will not abate or mitigate the problem. The task of tackling climate change is bigger than any single company. Everyone worldwide, from consumers, to businesses, to governments, must play an integral part in reducing global GHG emissions.
Our shared core values with society, our strong focus on corporate governance and transparency and our commitment to minimizing our environmental footprint and mitigating carbon emissions defines our investment case and underscores our commitment to the basic principles of ESG.
ESG is an important part of our underlying core business philosophy and we will continue to expand our sustainability disclosures as well as ongoing engagement with our stakeholders, our employees and the communities of the regions of our operations. We are committed to the highest ethical standards to underlie our effective corporate governance structure as we expand our operations domestically and internationally.
The pandemic of the past year was challenging for everyone in society, yet our highly valued employees met these challenges and ensured the continuity of our business operations. We are very proud of our team at NOVATEK, and efforts made over the past year. We believe we are well positioned to meet the future challenges of climate change and reducing our carbon footprint, and we hope that our 14th Sustainability Report reflects the efforts we have made in this important area.

Sustainability Report 2020 THINK GREEN. THINK NATURAL GAS.


Letter from the Deputy Chairman of NOVATEK’s Management Board. 
Dear Stakeholders,
This past year was an unprecedent time for society as we dealt with the harsh realities of economic lockdowns and the disruption to our normal ways of life. It was a landmark year for the ‘Social’ element of ESG1 as the devasting impact of COVID-19 clearly showed how important people are to sustain business operations despite the hardships endured by society.
We paid special attention to the health and wellbeing of our employees, our contractors and the population in the regions where we operate our production and processing facilities. The Company’s rapid response to the problems and challenges brought by the pandemic ensured the continuity of production and contributed to the protection of workers and local communities from the effects of the COVID-19 spread.
Our focus on the safe operations and employee training helped us improve our overall safety performance and deliver another year with zero fatalities. Under our newly developed UN SDG target “Good health and wellbeing” our work in the area of occupational safety is geared towards reducing the lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) with the annual decline of 5%. In 2020, the LTIFR among the Group’s employees registered at 0.49, representing a 29% decline compared to 2019.
We prepared our Sustainability Report in accordance with GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards, the Oil & Gas – Exploration & Production industry Sustainability Accounting Standard published by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). Our report is also aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) with detailed 1. ESG – Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance factors.
information on the Group’s approach to climate change and climate risk management. The external assurance was conducted on the performance data relating to our sustainability impacts, prepared in accordance with GRI Standards and, for the first time, included the SASB Standard.
Our business strategy is aligned and consistent with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) set by the UN General Assembly in 2015. We have implemented five priority goals within our environmental and social programs: SDG #3 - Good health and Well-Being, SDG #4 - Quality Education, SDG #7 - Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG #8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth, and SDG #13 - Climate Action. We have embedded ESG principles as an integral part of our Corporate Strategy and strive to continuously improve our operations and reporting across these dimensions. During the reporting period, the Company prioritized the UN SDGs, selected targets, and developed internal goals that will help achieve the maximum cumulative effect by 2030.
In 2020, NOVATEK’s Board of Directors undertook vital decisions toward directing the Company to address the issues of global climate change by establishing Environmental and Climate Change targets to reduce GHG emissions and air pollution throughout our liquids and natural gas value chains. We believe that setting realistic targets within our corporate strategy period up to 2030 is far more impactful than broad, aspirational statements up to 2050. This report contains our initial progress on achieving our Environmental and Climate Change targets.
Despite the increase of our hydrocarbons production, our Group’s GHG Intensity ratio decreased by 1% to 295 kg of CO2e per boe. This demonstrates a positive trend in reducing GHG emissions on the Group level and proves our low-carbon intensity position among our global oil and gas peers. During 2020, our Scope 1 GHG emissions also declined by 19% mainly due to the increase in APG utilization and the implementation of energy efficiency initiatives.
In addition, our specific GHG emissions were lower than our 2019 baseline: our upstream segment decreased by 31%, our processing segment by 9% and our LNG production by 8%. These results represent a notably reduction in our GHG emissions year-on-year. We want to reiterate that our operational strategy of producing more natural gas, not less, will contribute meaningfully to reducing global CO2 emissions, not only by implementing our GHG management framework, but mainly due to the benefits from coal-to-gas switching. We believe our pathway forward to increase our LNG production will make a notable contribution to reducing CO2 emissions for many decades and is a key component of the “Environmental” part of our ESG story.
Our 2020 Report includes new GHG disclosures such as the breakdown of Scope 1 emissions by source, methane emissions intensity and our Scope 3 emissions calculated based on the use of Company’s production volumes. Moreover, our 2020 GHG emissions under Scope 1 and 2 for the first time was subject to and received independent assurance verification. It is important that we fully demonstrate our transparency in measuring, verifying and reporting our ESG results.
We significantly increased our cryological disclosure as part of geotechnical monitoring due to the latest stakeholders’ awareness of Arctic permafrost incidents by other companies. Our main production facilities are located in Russia’s Arctic territory with severe climatic conditions in the area of permafrost. The Company regularly assesses the climate change impact on its operations, conducts geotechnical and environmental monitoring, developed a system for reporting GHG emissions, and applies innovative technologies to reduce emissions. We also take climate change scenarios into account based on historical data surveys at the design stages to account for climatic changes and its potential impact on our facilities.
The Company has voluntarily committed to regulate GHG emissions and the environmental impact on permafrost, as well as to implement all possible measures to reduce the impact on the atmosphere. We will also ensure that Arctic LNG 2 and our future LNG platform meets strict emissions standards, as well as reducing our environmental footprint on the Arctic permafrost by using the state-of-the-art, innovative GBS platforms. Our engineers have extensively assessed all our facilities built in the permafrost areas, confirming the stability and safety of these installations at our operations.
It is crucial that our content remains relevant to our stakeholders, so once every three years we undertake an assessment to define the material topics within the preparation process of our Sustainability Report. A new section on the Company’s innovations was included based on the feedback received on a questionnaire sent to stakeholder’s representatives. NOVATEK systematically conducts R&D activities in the field of geological exploration, drilling, production and processing of hydrocarbons. The Company’s specialists have developed and implemented unique technologies, some of which are used for the first time in the world. New technologies allow us to increase the economic efficiency of our production activities.
In addition, a separate section on cyber security risks was included in our 2020 Sustainability Report where we disclose NOVATEK’s systematic approach to ensure information security and integrity, and to adopt best practices in this important area as digitization increases throughout our operations.
We made significant progress in improving our external sustainability ratings. The majority of ESG rating agencies upgraded NOVATEK’s ESG rating over the past year. The most recent and probably the most significant upgrade came from MSCI ESG Ratings that upgraded our rating from “BBB” to “A”. We are the first and only Russian oil and gas company to receive an “A” ESG rating from MSCI. In addition, based on the 2020 assessments, our ESG ratings were also raised both by Sustainalytics and S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment.
One of the primary focus areas of sustainable development is managing the whole supply chain from production to end-consumers. This entails looking at every aspect of our business operations, including procurement of goods and supplies. In 2020, NOVATEK approved the Group’s Supplier Code of Conduct that details NOVATEK’s expectations that all suppliers comply with the principles of business transparency and integrity, business ethics and sustainable development included in our Code, as well as the guiding principles of the UN Global Compact, the International Labour Organization, the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and applicable environmental protection and industrial safety laws.
At NOVATEK, we view sustainability as a journey, rather than a destination. We are proud of our current results and determined to maintain our efforts with further enhancements of our sustainability practices. Sustainability is a foundation of our Corporate Strategy, past and present. We believe creating value is not mutually exclusive from our responsibilities as good stewards to the environment and societies where we operate, and therefore view our stakeholders more widely – including society, our employees and our shareholders. We believe that taking a wider view that is relevant to a wider constituencies is key to the long-term resilience and value of our business.

Innovation. 
Approaches to innovation. 
NOVATEK’s consistent research and development efforts are focused on geological exploration, drilling, production, treatment and processing of hydrocarbons. NOVATEK specialists have developed and are rolling out unique technologies, some of which are global-first innovations. By leveraging new technologies, the Company further improves the economic performance of its operations.
The Company’s innovation activities are guided by Russian and international law, including Federal Laws No. 127-FZ “on Science and State Scientific-Technical Policy”, No. 7-FZ “on the Environmental Protection”, No. 261-FZ “on Energy Saving and Energy Efficiency Improvement”, No. 187-FZ “on the Security of Critical Information Infrastructure of the Russian Federation” and No. 2395-1 “on Subsoil, as well as Executive Order of the Russian President” No. 666 “on Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions” dated 4 November 2020.
NOVATEK develops internal documents regulating the Company’s innovation activities, with alternative energy programs and policies starting to be developed in 2020. In particular, we tentatively identified focus areas for our alternative energy strategy, such as modern carbon capture and storage methods and technologies, as well as CO2 processing into value-added products (e.g., methanol, building materials and thermoplastics). The Company reviews the results of R&D projects on developing effective hydrogen storage and transportation technologies, as well as compares existing industrial technologies for hydrogen production from natural gas, exploring the options for driving cost optimization while controlling the technologies for CO2 emissions.
In 2017, the Company launched the Innovator Corporate Idea Management System to automatically collect and process employee suggestions for business improvement and development, including efficiency proposals. The system also aims to enhance employees’ intellectual potential as the most valuable ideas are rolled out company-wide in a variety of areas, including but not limited to production and management.
During 2020, more than 260 ideas to streamline the operating processes, reduce costs and implement new ways of working were submitted by employees of PAO NOVATEK and its 21 subsidiaries. More than 1,070 ideas have been submitted over the four years since the project launch, with 200 of them approved for implementation and 89 ideas implemented, generating a total economic benefit of over RR 4.3 bln.
Innovation focus areas. 
NOVATEK is driving innovations across a number of areas, including geological exploration, field development, well technologies, oil and gas production, alternative energy, information security, and occupational health and safety.
NOVATEK Scientific and Technical Center. 
NOVATEK has the facilities and resources to process primary data, develop and constantly update field models during field exploration and operation. NOVATEK Scientific and Technical Center was set up in 2010 with the main purpose of providing geological, geophysical, and processed field data required for building up the resource base and furthering field development. NOVATEK Scientific and Technical Center has been implementing a concept for building a corporate geological data bank. The use of advanced technologies for seismic data processing and analysis, as well as the development of 3D geological and hydrodynamic field models contribute to highly costeffective development of hydrocarbon fields with complex reserve structures.
The deployment of advanced technologies for gathering and interpreting data on geological features is a key focus area for NOVATEK Scientific and Technical Center, enabling it to support planning and implementation of exploration and drilling campaigns. NOVATEK Scientific and Technical Center is involved in a comprehensive research on oil and gas bearing prospects in the Arctic zone, providing scientific and methodological support for a regional project to build a consolidated model of the Gydan Peninsula, the north-east Yamal Peninsula, Gydan Bay, and Yenisei Bay.
In 2020, NOVATEK Scientific and Technical Center focused its research efforts on the following projects: • refinement of methods for quantitative accident risk assessment in LNG production, including the subsequent development of Safety Guidelines in this area. The development of this methodology will significantly reduce hazard zones in accidents, lowering the loads on buildings permanently occupied by employees and mitigating the need for reinforced building elements; • development of special technical requirements for laying fiber-optic lines in the same trench with in-field gathering pipeline systems to avoid extra trenching and save on land allotment for pipelining; • development of special technical requirements to replace hydrotesting of in-field pipelines with highpressure pneumatic tests to eliminate the need for complex post-test water disposal systems; • solution development to phase out fire towers with firewater monitors (for cooling process equipment) in favor of using stationary irrigation systems to reduce the land footprint of a site facility and cut construction and maintenance costs for complex fire equipment; and • solution development to combine water intake for operational and firefighting needs with the discharge of treated wastewater into surface water bodies for more reliable winter operation, as well as to reduce own electricity consumption in fish protection.
Innovations in production, exploration and development. 
NOVATEK’s exploration campaigns are focused on replacing and expanding its proved reserves. The Company’s systematic and holistic approach to the development of hydrocarbon resources allows the Company to find, explore for and produce hydrocarbons in the most efficient and cost-effective manner possible. The concentration of the Company’s producing and prolific fields in the same gasrich Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region provides favorable opportunities for increasing shareholder value with a minimum level of risks and at low production cost.
The main objectives in upstream research are to reduce losses in technological operations, facilitate effective exploration and production in challenging conditions, improve equipment reliability, design production and treatment facilities using energy-efficient equipment, and ensure environmental compliance.
The Company widely applies advanced technical solutions aimed at improving energy efficiency: frequencycontrolled electric drives for pumping and compressor equipment, efficient automatically controlled electric lighting and electric heating systems, LED lighting installations, to name a few solutions.

By driving innovations in production, exploration and field development, the Company has achieved a consistent track record of successes: • one of the first companies in Russia to pioneer drilling horizontal gas wells; • introduced multilateral well production technology at oil and gas fields; • started to develop of Achimov horizons with a recordbreaking drilled well in the Russian gas industry; • applied modern flow stimulation technologies including multistage hydraulic fracturing of a horizontal wellbore; and • advanced frictional desorption technology was used during the development of the Yurkharovskoye field, which includes an efficient process to recycle drilling mud for secondary use on a hydrocarbon basis and minimize waste, and as a result, the low-toxic oil from rock cuttings is later reused in a drilling mud.
NOVATEK has an increased focus on digitalization of various workflow steps. Starting from 2019, drilling and downhole treatment operations have been consistently and comprehensively digitized, involving the use of artificial intelligence technologies. These technologies enable real-time reliable data-driven decision-making, aimed at lowering accident and complication risks. In addition, in 2020, an ongoing digitization effort was launched for seismic operations to minimize downtime during the field season through faster decision-making and improve the quality of raw seismic data.
In 2020, NOVATEK focused its research efforts on production, exploration and field development in the following areas: • implementing “unmanned” technologies – a remote control and monitoring system for the technological process of hydrocarbon production from wells, enabling capital investment optimization for infrastructure projects; • using self-contained zero-emission power sources on remote pads with multiple gas wells (such as photovoltaic solar panels and wind turbines), enabling capital investment optimization when considering high-voltage line projects to address inadequate infrastructure; • developing a defect elimination technology for oil pipelines that requires no maintenance shutdowns to avoid freezing of pumped oil while eliminating oil pipeline defects; • using 3S separation technology, with gas passing through the unit reaching supersonic speed and thus improving the quality of gas dehydration and separation of liquid hydrocarbons; • carbon capture and storage, including reservoir injection. The first carbon capture and storage projects can be implemented at Yamal LNG and Arctic LNG 2; • partial substitution of fuel gas with hydrogen (with a lower carbon footprint) – the project is at the preliminary design stage for deployment at Yamal LNG; and • renewable power generation.
An important technological feature of the large-scale Arctic LNG 2 project, which sets it apart from the geographically close Yamal LNG project, is the use of gravity-based structures (GBS) to place LNG and stable gas condensate production trains. Russia’s first LNG plant to use GBS is manufactured at our unique LNG Construction Center in the Murmansk Region. The new technologies used in the project will significantly reduce its capital intensity while minimizing its environmental impact. The GBS-based project can be viewed as an optimal solution in terms of minimizing air pollution in the sensitive area of the Gydan Peninsula and the Ob Bay water area. In addition, the GBS platforms are not based on piles as they are installed on the seabed close to the shoreline. By using the GBS platform, which is only 25% the size of the Yamal LNG liquefaction train, the Company minimizes its impact on permafrost.
The key benefits of using GBS technology: • low level of a plant’s environmental impact (compared to other platform options); • high energy efficiency; • minimal land footprint of a plant’s onshore facilities; • minimized industrial accident rates at a plant; • an LNG or stable gas condensate plant can be installed within a short timeframe; • a plant’s core components can be towed over long distances; and • a plant’s core components can be reused at a new location.
Alternative energy innovations. 
The climate change challenge is a critical topic for the oil and gas industry. NOVATEK is actively working on effective and economically viable solutions in this area. Hydrogen technologies, as well as the renewables offer high potential for global GHG emissions reduction, so further efforts are needed to enhance and adapt them for use in the Arctic zone. For this purpose, NOVATEK is developing its alternative energy strategy for the medium and longer terms, establishing goals and objectives, as well as ranking and prioritizing projects for implementation.
Currently, our efforts are focused on the following areas: • review of alternative energy development areas that offer synergies with the Company’s core business (natural gas and LNG production); • analysis of key competitive advantages of the Company’s alternative energy business; these advantages include low-cost production of gas used in hydrogen production, the huge potential of geological formations on the Yamal and Gydan peninsulas to store captured CO2 to reduce GHG emissions, and the possibility of using CO2 to increase condensate recovery; • preliminary budget estimates and viability assessment for alternative energy projects; • review of the Company’s existing assets and projects in terms of the adoption of environmentally safe and cost-effective offshore development technologies, as well as offshore field facility construction in the Ob Bay (North-Obskoye field, Geofizicheskoye field, etc.); and • selection of technologies for the development of fields located in the Ob Bay water area based on the least environmental impact criterion and the use of zeroemissions technologies in operations (reinforced GBS, subsea production systems, etc.).
Innovations in information security. 
NOVATEK takes a systematic approach to information security, striving to meet the highest standards in this area.
In 2020, we focused on designing a project to build a corporate monitoring center to centralize the detection of information security incidents, as well as detect and prevent any impact from cyberattacks against critical information infrastructures of NOVATEK subsidiaries and joint ventures.
Innovations in occupational health and safety. 
NOVATEK is fully committed to putting the life and health of its employees above operational results and is aware of its responsibility for ensuring accident-free operations and safe working conditions for its employees, as well as for protecting the health of the population in its regions of operation.
In 2020, the COVID software solution was developed and implemented on a 1C platform to control the COVID-19 situation. This software solution allows us to track the rate of COVID-19 cases among the personnel and testing activities, identify those who are sick, and monitor their recovery. The use of this software enables timely responses and helps avoid unfavorable scenarios.
• designing a 450-ton environmentally friendly drilling rig to minimize the environmental impact from drilling under prospective projects and to reduce the carbon footprint. As part of the Company’s environmental strategy implementation, existing technical solutions were explored for future LNG project production drilling program to meet the zero-discharge requirements for drilling and minimize CO2 emissions into the atmosphere; • prioritizing the use of full-flow separators and multiphase flow meters to enable well surveys that release no hydrocarbons into the atmosphere. The impact achieved includes the utilization of gas reserves that would have been burned in well studies and reduction of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere; and • application of engineering solutions to accelerate well construction through closer well spacing in complex hydrography typical of the Arctic zone. This change in well spacing substantially reduces a facility’s land footprint and the input of materials and labor, thus cutting the construction time and cost. The distance between wells is determined as per the fire safety code, and closer spacing is made possible through the use of compensating solutions, such as thermal stabilization, downhole shut-off valves, and remote control of well valve blocks that provide fire safety. Smaller land footprints reduce anthropogenic environmental impacts, particularly in permafrost areas.
The Group’s operations use cogeneration technology, almost doubling fuel efficiency to achieve lower fuel gas consumption and a significant reduction in GHG emissions. The Group’s fuel efficiency ranges between 85% and 90%, reducing the volume of combustion products and in particular GHG emissions.
In 2020, to maintain reservoir pressure and increase oil recovery at the Yarudeyskoye field, reinjection of associated petroleum gas (APG) was introduced, driving APG utilization to over 98% across the field and 96.17% across the Company while reducing GHG emissions by 1.2 mmt of СО2 equivalent. The Group’s APG utilization totaled 5.1 bcm in 2020.
Innovations in LNG project design and operation. 
When designing LNG projects, the Company follows its policy of using advanced, effective yet proven technical solutions, which helps minimize the risks of below-design performance. NOVATEK also pays significant attention to research achievements in reducing the carbon footprint of LNG production.
The main priorities in LNG project upgrades: • improving energy efficiency in operations including through increased flue gas heat recovery and more efficient gas turbines. The project is implemented at Yamal LNG and was at the preliminary design stage as at the end of 2020; 24 25.

Our Approach to Sustainability. 
NOVATEK has taken an ESG-driven approach to sustainability, embedding ESG factors1, i.e., environmental protection, social impact and corporate governance, in its business strategy. Sustainable development is one of the key elements of the Company’s corporate strategy 2018 to 2030.
NOVATEK’s corporate purpose is to create sustainable value for all stakeholders along the entire value chain.
The Company has prioritized the following sustainability areas within ESG:
Environmental protection: climate change action, carbon footprint reduction; energy efficiency; minimizing waste, discharges and emissions; water saving; preserving biodiversity across the Company’s footprint; deployment of technologies that contribute towards our environmental goals.
Social policy: respect for human rights when engaging with all stakeholders; occupational health and safety; employee care, including decent working conditions and a range of employee benefits; employee training and development; support for local communities, including through effective dialogues.
Governance: combating corruption in all its forms; ethical conduct; responsible supply chain; fair executive compensation linked to KPI achievement; transparent tax strategy; gender balance in governance bodies, including the Board of Directors.
Our commitment to sustainability and special emphasis on ESG not only boost our profile but also increase the market value of our business. Indeed, most major international investment funds divest from companies that fail to meet sustainability criteria or to act on the global agenda issues such as climate change, responsible supply chains and human rights. Responsible stewardship of environmental and social topics along with strong economic performance indicate an overall strength of the Company’s governance and highlight its commitment to sustainability, driving the market capitalization of its business as well.
At NOVATEK, decisions on sustainability issues are taken at the highest corporate level, with the Board of Directors and executive committees actively involved in sustainable development management. The ultimate responsibility lies with the Board of Directors, which sets the strategic vision and defines the key focus areas for our sustainability programs. The list of KPIs for top management also includes ESG factors such as the HSE Management System performance index, which also covers climate change management.
1. ESG – Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance factors.
All of the above indicates the Company’s commitment to conducting business responsibly and its focus on driving sustainable growth over the long term.
Sustainable Development Strategy. 
The Company’s sustainability strategy is part of its overall business strategy and is built around society’s urgent need for change towards low-carbon development. NOVATEK’s contribution to a low-carbon future in line with the Paris Agreement goals of limiting the increase in global average temperatures to 1.5 °C is currently one of the Company’s key strategic focus areas.
As part of global decarbonization efforts, climate agenda and Russia’s approved Energy Strategy to 2035, NOVATEK is implementing climate change mitigation and adaptation measures and incorporates these aspects into its decision-making process.
The strategy covers the following energy transition goals: • Setting Environmental and Climate Change targets (adopted in 2020); • Reducing carbon footprint; • Improving energy efficiency; • Driving innovation in carbon emissions reduction and adoption of zero-carbon technologies; • Alternative energy development (hydrogen, renewables); • APG utilization; and • Carbon capture and storage.
In 2020, NOVATEK’s Board of Directors approved the Company’s Environmental and Climate Change targets for the period up to 2030 and established a separate business unit – the Department for Alternative Energy & Offshore Technologies, which includes the Alternative Energy and Hydrogen Division. In 2020, the Company joined the Methane Guiding Principles global initiative to drive the achievement of its methane emissions reduction targets.
The Company continuously steps up its sustainability efforts and implements strategic initiatives which also meet the demands of the wider global community. For example, in 2020, a woman was elected to NOVATEK’s Board of Directors for the first time. In 2020, the Company’s management approved the NOVATEK Group’s Supplier Code of Conduct including recommendations and principles of business transparency and integrity, business ethics and sustainable development which NOVATEK expects its suppliers to follow.
In 2021, the Company maintained its focus on global decarbonization issues and set carbon footprint reduction targets within its priority SDGs 7 and 13.

The COVID‑19 Pandemic’s Impact on Strategy. 
The spread of COVID-19 in 2020 caused significant economic disruption across global financial and commodity markets. The pandemic has profoundly affected the lives of millions of people and changed the ways the Company engages with society. During this period of uncertainty and volatility caused by the pandemic and subsequent economic restrictions, NOVATEK’s top priority remained unchanged – to protect the health and safety of our employees and their families, as well as contractor employees. Within these efforts, the Company also focused on supporting local communities across our footprint through socially important activities1. NOVATEK worked closely with federal, regional and local authorities, as well as partners to contain the spread of the virus, and took appropriate action, where necessary, to minimize possible operational disruptions and ensure business stability.
In 2020, the Company met all its operational targets for the year, despite the impact of lockdowns and the speed of the virus spread. The Company has taken the necessary preventive measures to reduce or eliminate the pandemic’s impact on work schedules. For example, despite massive delays and cancellations of other global LNG projects, the Company continued its Arctic LNG 2 project in 2020: all construction works at the Utrenneye field and the Utrenniy LNG terminal were on schedule.
During the year, the Company faced extreme volatility in both natural gas and crude oil prices and restrictions across many of its key markets. Importantly, 2020 saw natural gas prices showing signs of gradual recovery after hitting lows in late spring and early summer. Key importing 1. Details are available in the Social Investments section on p. 118.
countries have continued to shift from coal to natural gas as part of the Energy Transition. Most analysts believe that natural gas will play a vital role towards an environmentally sustainable future, with LNG as a key driver in future global gas demand growth.
Despite a lower demand for oil and natural gas in 2020, the LNG market was the only global commodity market to show growth for the year, which once again indicates its resilience to external headwinds and significant growth potential.
Recent market research updates suggest no pandemicinduced structural changes to long-term LNG demand forecasts. NOVATEK strategic goal remains unchanged – to increase LNG production and deliveries to the global market up to 70 mmtpa by 2030.
Importantly, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had any impact on global decarbonization ambitions of governments and businesses and even accelerated the energy transition, as well as adoption of zero-carbon technologies in certain industries. NOVATEK has also reiterated its priority focus on climate change mitigation action and other environmental protection targets.
At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic has clearly demonstrated the importance of social factors for business resilience. NOVATEK has prioritized protecting the health of its employees and local communities in the regions of operation, driving productivity and talent retention, improving product and service quality, and enhancing supply chain management. The Company’s nimble responses to the problems and challenges posed by the pandemic have ensured business continuity and helped to protect our workforce and local communities against the pandemic’s impacts.

Stakeholder Engagement Approach 102‑43 In the course of its business, NOVATEK engages with various stakeholders and is committed to building partnerships and maintaining ongoing dialogues with them for maximum efficiency in addressing the objectives of both the Company and society.
102‑42 The Company engages a fairly wide range of stakeholders. Our key stakeholders were identified based on the Company’s experience, the scale of its business, geographic location, the specific nature of the oil and gas industry and relevant dependencies. The Company maintains positive engagement with each stakeholder group using the entire mix of available channels. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, the Company moved much of its stakeholder communications online while also participating in various external (including industry-specific) online events.
1. A complete list of contacts is available in the Social Media and Contact Details section on p. 179.
NOVATEK aims to be very responsive to all stakeholder queries. To achieve this, the Company has established a range of communication channels to enable various stakeholder groups to communicate their suggestions, concerns, and queries to NOVATEK1.
NOVATEK’s stakeholder universe is quite diverse given the scale of the Company’s business and its impact on the economy and social environment in the regions of operation, as well as on the development of the oil and gas sector in Russia and globally. The Company places a special focus on key stakeholder groups such as shareholders, employees, and local communities, as their well-being is linked to the Company’s performance and sustainability.
Engagement formats • Queries through the Company’s website (www.novatek.ru/en); • Queries through the Security Hotline and the Ethics and Human Rights channel, handled 24/7; • Direct contacts with local communities through subsidiaries’ channels (by phone and in person through a Company representative); • Public consultations and meetings with local communities, including indigenous peoples of the Far North; • Working meetings with employees, including together with trade unions; • Annual and sustainability reports, press releases, presentations and other information materials, social media; • Conferences, round tables, joint working groups, panels; • Conference calls, telephone conversations; • Conducting and participating in surveys; • Media events; • Site visits for investors and journalists; and • Letters and emails in response to queries.
Stakeholder engagement principles • Openness and transparency; • Respect for human rights, non-discrimination; • Readiness to dialogue; • Considering the interests of all stakeholders; • Responding to all stakeholder concerns; and • Business ethics, zero tolerance for corruption.

Stakeholders: • Shareholders • Investors • Analysts • Employees • Trade unions • Federal and local authorities • Local communities • Partners • Suppliers and contractors • Customers • Civil society organizations • Industrial, academic, and research community • Media. 
Engagement with local communities 102‑43 As part of its regular activities, NOVATEK engages with stakeholders during the planning and construction of new facility projects, with local communities identified as a key stakeholder group.
The Company takes care to ensure that all stakeholders are given the opportunity to communicate questions, complaints, suggestions and comments during both the construction and operation of its projects. Information on the procedure for submitting and handing queries from stakeholders is posted on the websites of subsidiaries and joint ventures implementing projects and is also made available to local authorities.
The Company provides stakeholders with information on the activities planned in areas where indigenous peoples of the Far North traditionally live and earn their livelihoods. To consider the needs of local communities, the Company organizes and holds public consultations on economic or other activities planned under its projects within the areas of relevant municipalities.
The Company annually approves with stakeholders a list of activities to promote the economic development of communities.
As part of the Yamal LNG project, we have developed and continuously update the Stakeholder Engagement Plan (last updated in December 2020) identifying key stakeholders, standards and methods of stakeholder engagement, and potential impacts during project implementation, describing engagement activities undertaken, and containing information on the grievance and feedback mechanism.
Areas of NOVATEK’s engagement with indigenous peoples: • Regular meetings of the Advisory Board for the Yamal LNG Project Development and Implementation; • Ongoing consultations with the local communities based on the free, prior and informed consent received for the Yamal LNG project; • Implementation of the Plan to Promote the Sustainable Development of Indigenous Peoples; and • Support for non-profit organizations (NGOs of indigenous peoples of the Far North, research institutions, sports organizations, veterans’ associations, etc.).
Environmental and social impact assessment, disclosure and discussion of its results with stakeholders, and obtaining approvals from competent authorities – all are key to implementing the Arctic LNG 2 project. An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the Arctic LNG 2 project was conducted according to the statutory requirements and followed by a review and approval process by Russian authorities between 2017 and 2019. The purpose of the EIA was to demonstrate that the project met international environmental and social sustainability and HSE standards.
413‑1 The Company’s project activities that require environmental impact assessment and state environmental reviews according to Russian laws are accompanied by public consultations which are used as a key stakeholder engagement tool, above all for local communities living within the project area and local authorities. Apart from environmental impact assessments, social impact assessments were also conducted in accordance with international standards. The results of these assessments suggest that NOVATEK’s projects do not lead to higher unemployment or homelessness rates, or undermine food security, increase mortality and incidence rates, lead to loss of access to collective property and services, or result in social disengagement of local communities or other acute social issues.
In addition, the Company regularly provides financing for activities under the Public Program of Indigenous Peoples of the Far North in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region, initiated by the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region Governor based on the suggestions from local communities. NOVATEK also regularly provides financial support for events held by district and regional civil society groups protecting the rights and interests of indigenous peoples of the Far North.
Together with representatives of the Yamal District Grassroots Movement of the Indigenous Peoples of the Far North and district authorities, NOVATEK establishes advisory councils for regular consultations and development of joint decisions by stakeholders on environmental protection, healthcare, culture, 40 41. 
Sustainability Report 2020 THINK GREEN. THINK NATURAL GAS.


preservation of ancestral lands, protection and support for the traditional ways of life, economy and crafts of indigenous peoples of the Far North, as well as on other issues.
To mitigate its potential impact, NOVATEK also takes preventive measures, in particular the Company installs reindeer crossings to maintain the migration routes of nomadic indigenous peoples and builds winter roads for snowmobiles and sleds, and other transport.
Human rights of indigenous peoples of the Far North are discussed during advisory council meetings, public consultations and visits to nomadic families’ camping grounds within the South-Tambeyskoye license area. Information about these consultations, advisory support, meetings and their results is included in stakeholder engagement plans as well as in the Company’s corporate social responsibility reports.
Local communities have access to grievance mechanisms, with their complaints properly handled by the Company. The formal grievance mechanisms for local communities are described in the Yamal LNG Project Stakeholder Feedback Procedure. All queries are reviewed regardless of their nature. In 2020, all queries from indigenous peoples of the Far North were requests for assistance and support, with no human right violations or any other grievances reported.
OG10 OG12 413‑2 In 2020, there was no significant negative impact from NOVATEK operations on the local communities. No conflicts with local communities including the indigenous communities, and no activities that resulted in involuntary resettlement were reported in 2020.

Business Ethics NOVATEK pays special attention to safeguarding the rights and freedoms of the indigenous peoples of the Far North, and cares about preserving their culture and traditional ways of life.
Reports were received via Security Hotline in 2020 Grievances on human rights violations from indigenous peoples of the Far North 624 0 51 50. 
Sustainability Report 2020 THINK GREEN. THINK NATURAL GAS.


Approaches to Business Conduct 102‑16 NOVATEK is fully committed to the highest standards of ethical business behavior: the Company strictly complies with Russian laws while also striving to apply applicable international standards in practice.
The key documents that define the Company’s position on business ethics are the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, the Anti‑Corruption Policy, the Corporate Governance Code, and the Supplier Code of Conduct. All NOVATEK employees are responsible for compliance with the business ethics standards laid down in these documents. The implementation of these documents and compliance with generally accepted ethical standards is monitored by various departments within the Company: HR, Business Support, Legal, Procurement and Localization, Investor Relations, and Internal Audit.
NOVATEK identifies the following areas of ethical conduct as the Company’s priorities: • respect for human rights in all aspects; • zero tolerance for corruption, and anti-corruption efforts; • safe working conditions; people’s life and health as a top priority; • responsible attitude to the culture and traditions of local communities; and • information security and confidentiality of personal data.
The Company strives to create a business environment where business ethics standards are respected by all participants in the supply chain and stakeholders at large. An important step in this direction was the adoption in 2020 of the Supplier Code of Conduct, which defines the Company’s expectations from suppliers in terms of business ethics, human rights, labor relations, environmental protection, and health and safety.
Grievance mechanisms. 
NOVATEK’s interaction with stakeholders is designed to avoid any violations of human rights. The Company acknowledges the need for efficient resolution of such issues and to this end has developed and introduced a grievance mechanism. A number of channels have been set up for stakeholders, including local communities, to file complaints and requests: by phone, post or e-mail, via feedback and suggestion boxes1.
1. Details on grievance mechanisms for local communities are available in the Social Investments section, p. 118. A full list of contact details and ways to file reports is available in the Social Media and Contact Details section on p. 179. 2. A full list of contact details is available at https://www.novatek.ru/en/about/Hotline/.
The Company has a Security Hotline for reporting any offences, cases of fraud or corruption, conflicts of interest or other stakeholder concerns: security_hotline@novatek.ru, +7 (495) 232 39 59.
The Security Hotline contact details are available on NOVATEK’s website2. Security hotlines are also in place at subsidiaries and joint ventures, and their contact details are posted on websites, information boards in offices and production facilities, and at rotation camps.
NOVATEK has established a dedicated channel for reporting violations implying discrimination, harassment based on gender, race, nationality or any other grounds, bullying, or human rights breaches. Any person may report any known violations, including violations of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, by e-mail at ethics@novatek.ru. Designated employees review each message.
The Company guarantees confidentiality and undertakes to review all reports and take action if improper or unethical practices are identified.
The mechanisms adopted to collect reports and feedback help the Company ensure timely processing of complaints and resolution of conflicts and, more importantly, attempt to reduce the likelihood of similar incidents recurring in the future.
Anti‑Corruption and Prevention of Conflicts of Interest. 
NOVATEK is rated “A2” (companies with a high level of commitment to anti-corruption compliance) by the first national Anti-Corruption Ranking of Russian Business 2020 compiled by the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs.
NOVATEK strictly abides by the anti-corruption laws of Russia and other countries in which it operates. The Group is guided by uniform regulatory requirements for managing anti-corruption efforts, imposing and cancelling a trade secret regime, and protecting insider information. The Company’s Anti‑Corruption Policy sets out the key principles that underpin its efforts to counter and prevent corruption. The document is available on the Company’s website both in Russian and English. All subsidiaries and joint ventures of NOVATEK have similar documents in place.
When developing its Anti-Corruption Policy, NOVATEK took into account the requirements of international and foreign regulations, as well as the recommendations of Russian, foreign and international anti-corruption bodies and agencies.
International anti-corruption laws include: • United Nations Convention against Corruption; • Criminal Law Convention on Corruption of the Council of Europe; and • OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.
The United Kingdom Bribery Act is among foreign anticorruption laws.
The key requirements of the above regulations include: • prohibition to offer bribes or commercial bribes; • prohibition to bribe foreign public officials; and • prohibition to take bribes or commercial bribes.
205‑2 102‑17 All employees of NOVATEK receive ongoing training in ethical conduct and zero tolerance approach to illegal activities. To this end, the Company has developed and implemented an interactive online course “Basics of the Company’s Anti-Corruption Policy and Anti-Corruption Practices for Employees”, which is available on the Company’s intranet portal at the starting page and in the special section for new employees. The employees of the Company subsidiaries and affiliates also have access to the course via a single hyperlink. In addition, all employees may at any time seek advice on compliance with the AntiCorruption Policy, ethical conduct, confidentiality, and other similar matters.
All partners of the Company are made aware of NOVATEK’s Anti-Corruption Policy and strict standards of ethical business practices and undertake to comply with them, in line with an anti-corruption clause incorporated into all the Company’s contracts with third parties.
102‑17 The Company’s Security Hotline is one of the most important anti-corruption tools that any stakeholder can use to report known cases of corruption or any other concerns.
In 2020, the NOVATEK Group’s security hotlines received 624 reports from citizens and organizations, including: • 356 reports related to issues arising from the performance of a contract for the supply of natural gas for residential customers (clarification of grounds and procedure for gas payment calculation, maintenance of consumer building and apartment gas equipment, replacement and calibration of gas meters, etc.); • 128 reports related to the implementation of measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 at the Group facilities; • 84 reports related to the operations of gas retail stations and multi-fuel fueling stations (bonus points accrual, fueling stations’ working hours, volume of gas tanks refueling, operator/cashier rudeness towards customers at fueling stations, etc.); and • 56 reports related to delayed salary payment to employees of contractors and subcontractors, challenging the results of tender procedures, fraudulent acts, etc.
205‑2 The Anti-Corruption Policy is available to all stakeholders on the Company’s website. Information on the document is also disclosed in the Company’s sustainability reports. 100% of employees, governance body members and business partners are informed of the Company’s AntiCorruption Policy.
The person in charge of implementing and overseeing the measures aimed at preventing corruption across the Company is the Anti-Corruption Adviser, from whom advice may be sought by any employee looking for clarifications on the Anti-Corruption Policy or other corruption-related matters. To prevent corruption, the Company develops Action Plans to be undertaken to implement the Anti-Corruption Policy.
During the reporting year, anti-corruption initiatives were implemented as part of the 2020 Action Plan, including: • monitoring of Russian and foreign anti-corruption laws and relevant law enforcement practices; • advising Company employees on the practical application of the provisions of NOVATEK’s AntiCorruption Policy, Regulations on the Conflict-ofInterest Management at NOVATEK, and on handling confidential information; and • monitoring Company employees’ compliance with the requirements of NOVATEK’s Anti-Corruption Policy.
The results of anti-corruption efforts and the new 2021 Action Plan were discussed and approved by the Audit Committee on 17 December 2020.
Reports were received via Security Hotline in 2020 624 52 53.

Prevention of conflicts of interest 102‑25 NOVATEK places a special emphasis on preventing conflicts of interests to maximize its performance and protect shareholder interests. For effective conflict of interest risk management, certain employees in key decision-making capacities are required to disclose conflicts of interest (or their absence) by filling in respective declarations.
NOVATEK managers and employees are expected to perform their duties putting corporate interests first and foremost and separating their personal interests from decision-making.
Should their personal and corporate interests become incompatible, NOVATEK managers and employees are obliged to report such a conflict immediately. They are also expected to refrain from any forms of competition with the Company in business and investment projects. Company employees are not allowed to pursue any property or financial interests in competitor businesses. They are advised to refrain from conducting interestedparty transactions. The Company also seeks to avoid conflicts of interest caused by giving/receiving gifts, services or any other benefits.
Members of the Board of Directors shall: • promptly give the Chairman of the Board a written notification of personal or commercial interests in any transaction, including those involving the Company securities; and • duly disclose their jobs with other companies.
• Members of the Management Board shall: • notify the Management Board of any personal interests in transactions to which the Company is or intends to be a party, before such transactions are decided upon; and • set up or manage no business entities competing with NOVATEK, except as permitted by the Board of Directors.
Human Rights. 
Human rights are a key element of NOVATEK’s business ethics, gaining in importance in engagement with stakeholder groups such as, but not limited to, Company employees and local communities across the Company’s footprint. The Company strictly complies with Russian human rights legislation and also embraces principles and guidelines set out in the following international human rights instruments: • Universal Declaration of Human Rights; • International Labor Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work; • UN Global Compact; and • Social Charter of Russian Business.
The Company’s commitment to human rights is reflected in its key corporate documents (Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Anti‑Corruption Policy, Supplier Code of Conduct, Health, Safety and Environment Policy, and Collective Bargaining Agreement).
NOVATEK uses the following mechanisms to ensure that human rights are respected: • the Company is committed to human rights, and integrates them into internal regulations; • the Company engages stakeholders in a dialogue on human rights; • the Company ensures that its employees and partners respect human rights; • the Company safeguards the rights of local communities including indigenous peoples of the Far North; and • the Company develops feedback channels that enable stakeholders to express their views or grievances on related matters (specifically, the Security Hotline).
In 2020, as part of its risk mapping exercise, the Company updated its conduct risks to include human rights risks, making it possible to objectively assess its human rights impacts and prevent conflict or unethical situations.
408‑1 409‑1 With regard to labor relations, the Company has identified the following human rights risks: health and safety (injuries, occupational diseases, etc.), discrimination on any grounds, the use of forced and child labor, breach of collective bargaining agreement and limiting freedom of association. The Company manages the human rights risks associated with labor relations primarily by ensuring full compliance with the Labor Code and other laws of the Russian Federation, which in itself precludes human rights violations. NOVATEK does not use child or forced labor.
Our HR decisions are based on employee qualifications, knowledge and professional skills; when dealing with employees and any other individuals, the Company does not take into account any other personal characteristics such as race, gender, age, ethnicity, religion, political or other beliefs, social background, etc.
NOVATEK respects the right and wish of employees to form associations to protect their interests. Moreover, the Company views such associations as an opportunity to get feedback and maintain a positive dialogue with employees through in-person meetings, meetings of union committees, and conferences. Open discussions of disputes and issues strengthen the foundation of the partnership and help develop the Company’s capabilities.
NOVATEK is a member of IndustriALL Global Union1 and the CIS International Confederation of Trade Unions of Workers in the Oil and Gas Industries, and Construction Workers in the Oil and Gas Complex through its membership in the Russian Oil and Gas Construction Workers’ Union whose activities are aimed at protecting professional, social and labor rights and interests of Union members. In its operations, the Russian Oil and Gas Construction Workers’ Union is guided by the principles of social partnership.
To ensure reliable protection of employees from injuries or other harm, the Company strictly monitors compliance with occupational health and safety standards and regulations, offers training and education, further improves its occupational health system, and provides quality healthcare services.
Risks associated with human rights of local communities include aspects such as illegal or forced relocation, disruption of traditional ways of life and cultural traditions, and environmental damage. The Company recognizes its responsibility to local communities and the environment in its regions of operation and guarantees respect for human rights through various mechanisms such as strict compliance with environmental and social legislation, ongoing dialogue with local communities, and provision of channels to submit reports and grievances, which must be addressed at all times. NOVATEK also makes a significant contribution to the economic and social development of its regions of operation, including infrastructure development, targeted assistance and support for educational, sports and social projects across its footprint.

The Company pays special attention to safeguarding the rights and freedoms of the indigenous peoples of the Far North, and cares about preserving their culture and traditional ways of life. NOVATEK regularly informs its employees as well as contractor and subcontractor employees about the norms of behavior within indigenous areas (including cultural heritage sites).
NOVATEK considers human rights risks with regard to supplier engagement. At the same time, the Company is aware that suppliers can both be exposed to human rights risks and have their own human rights impacts. NOVATEK makes sure that its partners share the Company’s ethical principles: violations of the human rights of employees, local communities and other people by suppliers are unacceptable. In its interactions with suppliers, NOVATEK is also focused on assessing and mitigating the risk of corruption and other forms of unfair conduct. The Company’s position regarding ethical and other norms of conduct expected from suppliers is set forth in its Supplier Code of Conduct adopted in 2020.
Information Security. 
NOVATEK takes a systematic approach to information security, striving to meet the highest standards in this area. Information security matters are managed by the Information Security Department.
In 2020, NOVATEK developed a number of regulations on information security: • Information Security Policy; • Regulations on Corporate Information Network Building; • Corporate Information Network Policy; • Automated Workstation Roll-Out Procedures; and • Backup and Recovery Procedures.

Internal Control and Audit1. 
NOVATEK has a system of internal controls over financial and business operations aligned with Russian laws and best international practices. The internal control system is an integral part of the risk management system and is aligned with the relevant risks and strategic goals of NOVATEK.
The primary objectives of the internal control system are the implementation of NOVATEK’s strategy, protection of shareholder interests, asset integrity, efficiency of financial and business operations, and compliance with applicable laws and the Group’s internal regulations.
The internal control system functions on an ongoing basis and covers all the Company’s lines of business and business processes at all management levels.
The responsibility for defining the principles of, and approaches to, organizing the internal control system is vested in the Board of Directors. The Chairman of the Management Board ensures efficient functioning of the internal control system. The Internal Audit Division evaluates the efficiency of the risk management, internal control and corporate governance system.
The internal control system comprises the Board of Directors, Audit Committee, Chairman of the Management Board, Management Board, Revision Commission, and Internal Audit Division.
1. Details on Internal Control and Audit are available in NOVATEK’s Annual Report 2020, pp. 68-69.
The primary objects of internal control are NOVATEK, its subsidiaries and joint ventures, their business units, as well as their ongoing business processes.
The Annual General Meeting of Shareholders approves an external auditor to conduct an independent review of NOVATEK’s accounting (financial) statements.
In accordance with auditing standards, in order to maintain independence, the Company’s external Auditor regularly rotates its key audit partner, at least once every seven years. Last time, the Auditor’s partner was rotated in 2018.
Risk Management 102‑15 NOVATEK’s activities are subject to risks inherent in the oil and gas sector.
NOVATEK operates and continuously develops a multilevel system of risk management and internal control. The Company’s risk management and internal control system is aimed at protecting shareholder and other stakeholder rights and legitimate interests, timely adjusting to internal and external changes, providing reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the Company’s objectives and implementing its sustainable development strategy.
Powers, duties and responsibilities for specific risk management procedures are delegated to different governance levels of the Company depending on the assessment of financial impact of risk. The Company’s risk management policy is set out in Regulations on Risk Management and Internal Control System of NOVATEK guided by the following international standards: COSO Internal Control – Integrated Framework, and Enterprise Risk Management – Integrated Framework (ERM COSO). Certain elements of ISO 31000 Risk Management – Guidelines have also been integrated into NOVATEK’s risk management system. The risk management system was not based on the Risk Management Standard (RMS FERMA) developed by IRM, AIRMIC and ALARM, but its components do not contradict the above standards which were taken into account to varying degrees.
To mitigate subjectivity restricting the risk management process in a negative way, the Company has in place a multilevel system of risk management and internal control.
102‑29 102‑30 In order to ensure a uniform methodology and coordinate risk management activities, the Company has established the Risk Control Division. The risk management process involves the Company’s top management, including the Board of Directors’ Audit Committee. The Committee is responsible for supervising the reliability and efficiency of the risk management system and reviewing it. As part of its efforts, the Committee helps monitor identified risks and adjust risk mitigating initiatives as needed. Matters related to risk appetite and the risk management systems are reviewed annually.
2. From the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on 24 April 2020 until the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on 23 April 2021. 3. Details on risks are available in NOVATEK’s Annual Report 2020, pp. 74–87.
102‑31 At least once a year, the Audit Committee evaluates the Company’s risk management performance, including economic, environmental and social risks. Following the evaluation in the reporting year, the Audit Committee recognized NOVATEK’s risk management activities as compliant with the Company’s respective policy.
In corporate year 20202, the Audit Committee paid significant attention to risk management policies and processes in the Company and reviewed financial, operational, legal, and other risks at in-person meetings. Furthermore, in 2020, the implementation of NOVATEK’s anti-corruption and information policies was reviewed and the activity plan for the next period was approved.
The Management Board discloses a list of risks and approaches to risk management in the Annual Report3.

Risk Risk description Risk management approaches used by the Company. 
Climate change risks. 
The Company’s business may be affected by the following climate change risks: • transitional risks that arise during transition to a lower-carbon economy, e.g., due to changes in stakeholder behavior, changes in legislation, and other changes. If they materialize, these risks can cause additional expenses, hydrocarbon prices below the forecast, reduced revenues, and limited development opportunities; and • physical risks that directly affect facilities and are caused by a major short-term impact (e.g., an act of God) or long-term climate change (permafrost degradation, global sea level change, periods of abnormally high temperatures).
Risks and opportunities associated with climate change are taken into account in the Company’s business strategy. The Company regularly monitors market trends, keeps track of changes in legislation regulating greenhouse gas emissions, assesses the impact of such changes and updates its plans accordingly, invests into the development of innovative energy-efficient zero-emission technologies, considers the risks and opportunities of current and expected environmental conditions to efficiently manage the project portfolio and maintain sustainable development.
The Company pays significant attention to risks related to climate change and GHG emissions. The Company’s risk management system enables integrating climate change risks into both executive decisionmaking and day-to-day operations.
NOVATEK has developed and is implementing its GHG Emissions Management System Standard. Pursuant to the standard, GHG emission qualification and reporting are included in the Integrated Management System.
The Company develops a GHG emission reporting system and uses efficient modern technologies to reduce emissions during production, processing and transportation of gas and liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas liquefaction, power generation, and other processes. The Company sets ambitious targets, which when achieved would help reduce GHG emissions in accordance with global initiatives, and climate change action is among the Company’s sustainable development priorities. In August 2020, NOVATEK’s Board of Directors approved the Company’s Environmental and Climate Change targets for the period up to 2030, including emission reduction, rational use of associated petroleum gas, and waste disposal.
The Company assesses climate change risks of physical impact and climate change implications both at the engineering and operation stages, and makes appropriate provisions. NOVATEK regularly performs cryological monitoring, which shows that the risk of permafrost thawing and degradation is low at the moment and has no significant impact on the Company’s operations. To prevent potential negative implications of climate change and assess the condition of permafrost soil and the temperature range at all of the Company’s facilities, NOVATEK uses advanced technologies and equipment for thermal stabilization of soil where foundation piles are driven during the construction phase. The Company holds property and business interruption insurance policies against these risks.
Epidemic risks/ COVID-19. 
The spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) caused financial and economic tensions in the markets around the world, and this is beyond the Group management’s control. To ensure uninterrupted operations during the pandemic, special measures had to be introduced to ensure business continuity and protect the health and safety of the Company’s employees and other stakeholders. The magnitude and duration of these events remain indefinite and may continue to affect the Group’s revenues, cash flows and financial standing.
The Company assessed potential impact of COVID-19 on employees and operations, and has developed appropriate response plans. For instance, the Company is investing in tools enabling efficient remote work.
NOVATEK’s management takes all necessary precautions to protect the health and safety of its employees and their families, as well as counterparties from the spread of the coronavirus while fulfilling its obligations to supply energy resources domestically and internationally. NOVATEK maintains close cooperation with federal, regional and local authorities, as well as with partners to contain the spread of the coronavirus, and takes necessary action to minimize potential disruptions.
NOVATEK complies with all recommended measures to contain the pandemic. Additional sanitary protection measures have been implemented at the Company’s offices and facilities: frequent sanitary cleaning is conducted at the Company’s premises, additional disinfectant dispensers are installed, and employees are provided with masks and gloves for obligatory use at workplaces. Many employees in the regions of our operation are working remotely, business trips are limited, and all our employees have detailed instructions on prevention measures. In the regions of operation, the Company organizes regular testing of its employees, purchases personal protective equipment, and helps provide the necessary equipment, reagents and medical supplies to diagnostic laboratories and hospitals.
NOVATEK uses stress testing to assess its resilience against the potential impact of the most significant risks as well as possible approaches to risk management, which may be applied to prevent or mitigate the impact of the key risks. In particular, the Company annually conducts stress testing by doing a simulation for the scenarios of risks of emergencies and incidents at production facilities to assess potential damage to property and gross profit losses (the data are used to provide insurance protection for NOVATEK) and develops additional initiatives to mitigate the implications of those scenarios. Moreover, the outlook of financial performance is assessed annually and when necessary due to significant macroeconomic changes, including the outlook of revenues and expenses, cash flows, investment opportunities, financial covenants and other indicators in numerous scenarios of the key drivers, including macro parameters, prices in global energy markets, the number of investment projects being implemented, and other parameters of the Company’s operations.
Risk insurance. 
Risk insurance is an integral part of NOVATEK’s risk management system. In 2020, the insurance coverage guaranteed adequate protection against the risks of damage to the business of NOVATEK, its subsidiaries and joint ventures. Insurance coverage is provided by reputable insurance companies that have high ratings from leading rating agencies1 with partial reinsurance of risks by major international insurance and reinsurance companies.
Obligatory risk insurance. 
NOVATEK fully meets the requirements of the applicable Russian laws for maintaining obligatory insurance, such as civil liability insurance of owners of hazardous production facilities and owners of vehicles.
The NOVATEK Group also fully complies with legislative insurance requirements in the countries where it operates.
Optional risk insurance. 
To reduce the risk of financial losses, the Company maintains the following types of optional insurance: • insurance of the risk of property damage/loss, including the risk of mechanical failures; • insurance of the risk of damage from business interruption (business risks); 1. Standard & Poor’s, Fitch Ratings, Expert RA, A.M. Best.
• construction risk insurance; • insurance of risks related to prospecting, exploration and production (risk of loss of control over a well); • transport insurance; • cargo insurance; • directors’, officers’ and companies’ liability insurance (D&O insurance); • charterers’ liability insurance; and • employees voluntary health insurance as part of the social benefits package.
Since 2013, the Company has in place a comprehensive program of property and business risk insurance with respect to key assets of NOVATEK, its subsidiaries and joint ventures. The cumulative insured amount for the risks of property damage and business interruption as at the end of 2020 was RR 910 bln. The implemented program is viewed by the Company’s management as an efficient measure for mitigating the consequences of potential accidents and provides additional guarantees for the attainment of the expected net profit and key indicators of the Company’s performance. Beyond the scope of the comprehensive program, given the project’s scale, Yamal LNG is insured against property damage and business interruption.
In the reporting year, no insured major accidents or incidents occurred.
For more than 15 years, NOVATEK has maintained the directors’, officers’ and companies’ liability insurance (D&O insurance) covering the Group and the Company’s top management against possible third-party claims for any losses incurred through any wrong action (or decision) by its governance bodies as well as in connection with claims against the Company under its securities. The overall limit of respective insurance coverage is EUR 120 mln. The existing insurance coverage is in line with international insurance standards in terms of the scope of risk cover and limits of indemnity.

Climate Change Approaches. 
Climate change is a global challenge and a key issue for both the oil and gas industry and business in general. NOVATEK focuses its environmental protection efforts on approaching climate change management strategically while consistently reducing its greenhouse gas emissions.
NOVATEK embraces the Paris Climate Agreement ratified by the Russian Federation in 2019 and makes every effort to curb GHG emissions.
NOVATEK’s business strategy published in 2017 applied the forecasts from major research firms, which included scenarios accounting for the Paris Climate Agreement in terms of reducing global CO2 emissions. The forecasts were based on the following key assumptions: • significant progress in reducing GHG emissions and air pollution; • a shift from coal to cleaner energy sources; • improved energy efficiency; and • active spread of renewables.
In 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved Environmental and Climate Change targets, including GHG emissions reduction1.
NOVATEK’s Environmental and Climate Change targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions2. 
By 2030: reduce the methane emissions per unit of production in the production, processing and LNG segments by 4% reduce GHG emissions per unit of production in the upstream segment by 6% reduce GHG emissions per ton of LNG produced by 5% increase the APG utilization rate to 99%
In 2021, as part of its prioritized UN SDG Climate Action, the Company approved its targets to improve energy efficiency, expand the use of renewables, advance the production of hydrogen and methane/hydrogen mixes, as well as other low-carbon gas products3.
1. Details are available in the Environmental Performance and Protection section, p. 90. 2. 2019 is the base year for the long-term targets. 3. Details are available in the Sustainable Development Strategy section, p. 26.
NOVATEK’s carbon footprint reduction targets. 
Reduce GHG emissions • By 2025, cut methane emissions from operations of LNG fueling stations by 20% • Reduce the carbon footprint of our products sold internationally. 
Develop alternative energy • Ramp up the production of hydrogen, methanehydrogen mixtures, ammonia and other low-carbon fuels produced from natural gas • Expand the use of renewables at gas and condensate production facilities. 
Improve energy efficiency • Use energy-efficient LNG production technologies to increase the availability of LNG and reduce GHG emissions • Continuously improve the energy efficiency of hydrocarbon production and processing. 
Supply clean energy • By 2030, increase LNG production from Company’s projects up to 70 mmtpa • By 2025, install LNG fueling stations along European Russia’s main traffic arteries • By 2025, supply LNG to consumers in areas remote from existing gas transmission infrastructure. 
Climate change management. 
Key climate change topics, including corporate governance, strategy, risk management, and climate change targets, are the responsibility of the Company’s top management and are reviewed at the Board of Directors’ meetings.
In August 2020, NOVATEK’s Board of Directors approved the Company’s Environmental and Climate Change targets for the period up to 2030, including emissions reduction and an increase in the APG utilization rate. The Board of Directors approves and follows up sustainability initiatives aimed at ensuring information transparency and generating long-term value for investors and other stakeholders.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, whose responsibility includes monitoring and analyzing of the risk management framework effectiveness, has a strong focus on climate change risks. From 2019, the Board’s Remuneration and Nomination Committee took over the responsibility for sustainability monitoring. The Committee prepares recommendations to inform decisions made by the Company’s Board of Directors on sustainability issues, including on climate change.
The Company’s climate change strategy is closely linked to minimizing its environmental footprint. Assessment of climate change risks and opportunities is a standard process within NOVATEK’s Environmental Management System operating to ISO 14001:2015.
4. Details on GHG emissions are available in the Environmental Performance and Protection section on p. 100.
Our GHG Emissions Management System designed in accordance with the Climate Doctrine of the Russian Federation is an integral part of the Company’s Environmental Management System. As part of this system, NOVATEK has compiled an inventory of GHG emissions sources and developed an automated GHG estimation module within the GHG Management System, defining specific GHG emissions targets for each business line (hydrocarbon production and processing, and LNG production).
Issues related to GHG emissions4 fall within the authority of NOVATEK’s top management, and in particular Deputy Chairman of the Management Board – Operations Director, who is responsible for the Integrated HSE Management System.

Risks and Opportunities 201‑2 NOVATEK’s risk management system enables integrating climate change risks into both executive decision-making and day-to-day operations.
Climate change risk management is an integral part of NOVATEK’s multi-tier risk management system. Climate change risks are identified, analyzed and assessed by risk owners (heads of business lines and structural units) in coordination with the Risk Control Division. Risks are identified in line with a classification according to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Materiality of climate change risks is analyzed against the same criteria that are used to assess other types of risks, including probability and financial impact. Financial impact is measured as a combination of negative impact on gross profit or EBITDA, damage to property, and/or additional costs. Risk materiality assessment is adjusted to newly identified external and internal factors.
The Company analyzes climate change risks on an annual basis in order to properly address them and work out appropriate management measures. NOVATEK has a procedure for assessing climate change risks relating to its physical impact on the Company’s operations at the facility design, construction and operation stages as well as when preparing surveyor’s reports for risk insurance purposes. This procedure is a standard element of NOVATEK’s Environmental Management System certified to ISO 14001:2015. NOVATEK plans to update and improve its approaches to climate change risk identification and assessment going forward.
NOVATEK’s business strategy recognizes risks and opportunities related to climate change. The Company regularly monitors market trends, considers the risks and opportunities of current and expected environmental conditions to efficiently manage the Company’s project portfolio and maintain sustainable development, keeps track of changes in legislation regulating GHG emissions, assesses the impact of such changes and updates its plans accordingly, and invests into the development of innovative energy-efficient zero-emission technologies.
The approach to climate change risk management we have implemented allows us to enhance the sustainability of the Company’s strategy. The worldwide trend is to shift to lower-carbon energy sources, which opens up great business prospects for NOVATEK as a natural gas and LNG producer. It also offers opportunities to expand into the emerging clean energy markets both in Russia and abroad. Higher natural gas demand means improved financial performance for the Company, driven by expanding opportunities to develop new LNG projects.
1. IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2019. 2. IEA, The Role of Gas in Today’s Energy Transitions.
Research firms expect that the pledges made by developed countries as signatories to the Paris Agreement, as well as carbon neutrality targets adopted by many countries and a shift to a low-carbon economy will reduce the consumption of conventional fuels and drive the demand for natural gas and LNG.
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), coalto-gas switching in power generation can provide “quick wins” for global emissions reductions. The total emissions can be reduced by 1.2 gigatons of CO2 with existing power infrastructure, which will bring the energy sector’s global emissions down by nearly 10%1. Between 2010 and 2018, coal-to-gas switching abated nearly 0.5 gigatons of CO2 2.
Analysts estimate that, on average, the share of coal and petroleum products in the global energy mix will decrease while the share of natural gas will at least stay relatively stable or, according to most forecasts, will gradually increase. Subject to the volumetric growth of total energy consumption, global demand for natural gas and LNG is projected to grow.
Natural gas remains the primary back-up fuel for renewables (solar and wind) and helps reduce emissions by replacing coal, oil and refined products as energy sources, which opens a strategic growth window for the Company.
Natural gas will be an integral part of the global energy mix in the fundamental shift from environmentally harmful fossil fuels toward cleaner energy sources. The Company’s Corporate Strategy to 2030 projects that LNG will play an important role in replacing coal for power generation, and its current, wider use as a marine and transport fuel will continue to expand.
For example, 62 mmt of LNG annually could replace up to 152 mmt of bituminous coal, preventing emissions of more than 170 mmt of CO2, and contributing to global carbon footprint reduction. NOVATEK’s strategy also provides for promoting LNG and compressed natural gas as motor fuels, being a more environmentally friendly alternative to diesel fuel and therefore contributing to lower emissions.
The recent changes in environmental regulation also create strategic opportunities for NOVATEK. The new international environmental regulations on marine fuels (IMO 2020) will have a large impact on shipping and shipbuilding industries, eliminating fuel oil and expanding the share of LNG used as a marine fuel.
In October 2020, NOVATEK joined the Methane Guiding Principles global initiative. The initiative is a voluntary international multi-stakeholder partnership between industry and non-industry organizations with a focus on priority areas for action along the natural gas value chain. The Company has joined international oil and gas industry leaders and global organizations to reduce methane emissions from its operations, improve the accuracy of its emissions data and work out measures to control methane emissions. NOVATEK’s GHG emissions and, in particular, methane emissions rates are among the lowest in the global oil and gas sector as the bulk of its output accounts for natural gas.
NOVATEK has developed and is implementing its GHG Emissions Management System standard. Pursuant to the standard, GHG emissions qualification and reporting are included in the Integrated Management System. NOVATEK assesses risks and opportunities at least once a year, reviewing GHG emissions reports that are submitted to the Company by subsidiaries and joint ventures. An unscheduled assessment of risks and opportunities is conducted when the target indicators change, or a stakeholder request is received.
201‑2 Climate change risks are usually categorized into transition risks (related to the transition period) and physical risks: • Transition risks can occur when moving towards a decarbonized economy including as a result of changes in stakeholder behavior, regulations or other changes (transition risks include carbon pricing, technology advancement, change in consumer behavior, or failure to meet requirements of investors and other financial market players for climate change disclosure); • Physical risks can have a direct impact on assets or indirectly affect business value chains. Physical risks 3. Details are available in the Environmental Performance and Protection section, p. 90. 4. The GHG Intensity ratio is calculated by dividing the total GHG combustion emissions from the total hydrocarbon production into the hydrocarbon production volumes (in boe). 5. Details are available in the Environmental Performance and Protection section, p. 99.
are categorized into acute risks (for example, natural disasters) and chronic risks (for example, permafrost degradation, higher temperatures leading to rising sealevels or periods of abnormally high temperatures).
NOVATEK operates an environmental management system certified to ISO 14001:2015 to ensure sustainable use of resources and minimize the adverse impact the Company’s operations may have on the environment3.
The Company adheres to the principle of responsible investment in operations, which implies that new design solutions, technologies, and equipment installed help minimize environmental impact.
Since 2008, NOVATEK has been annually reporting on its GHG emissions (including methane) and energy efficiency of its operations via the global Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).
305‑4 Since 2019, the Company has been calculating the carbon footprint of its products. In 2020, its GHG Intensity ratio4 decreased by 1.02% year-on-year to 295.1 kg of CO2 equivalent per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) of output, one of the lowest levels among international and Russian oil and gas producers, which demonstrates a positive trend in the reduction of GHG emissions across the Group. Moreover, for the first time, NOVATEK is disclosing its Scope 3 GHG emissions from the use of Company’s production volumes for the “use of sold products” category in Air Emissions sub-section5.

Transition risks. 
Strategic risk. 
Current long-term forecasts envision a stable growth in natural gas consumption, assuming coal and petroleum products as energy sources are partly replaced by natural gas. A significant portion of current power generation is based on natural gas, and such countries as China and India, for example, are moving away from burning coal with high environmental pollution to natural gas and increasing the share of gas-fired power generation. At the same time, lower speed of the global economy’s transition towards the cleaner types of fuel is a risk to global gas demand.
Should the governments reconsider their clean energy programs or cut respective subsidies or should generation capacity upgrades slow down or other significant changes in the economic or geopolitical situation occur, the demand for natural gas may weaken, while its growth will be significantly slower. As a result, lower than expected prices for hydrocarbons may have a negative impact on the Company’s revenue, as well as on its ability to develop new ambitious LNG projects.
Carbon price. 
Carbon control systems can be set up as climate policy instruments at the national and regional levels, which can impose carbon quotas or carbon taxes on producers (cross-border adjustment mechanisms), which, in turn, can give rise to significant additional costs for the Company.
Market risk. 
Possible decline in gas demand in the domestic (Russian) market due to changes in seasonal climate cycles.
Technology risk. 
Loss of market position due to the development of innovative energy-efficient technologies involving zero GHG emissions and renewables with the ensuing changes in demand for hydrocarbons. At the same time, investments in new low-carbon technologies also pose some risks should they prove ineffective.
Legislative/regulatory risk. 
Legislative and regulatory risks are associated with the adoption of new regulations on business activities in the Arctic and GHG emissions, as well as with the requirements for climate change risk disclosures to regulators and stock exchanges.
Reputational risk. 
Various stakeholder groups and the wider public are becoming increasingly aware of the Company’s role in the context of climate change and the energy transition to low-carbon energy sources. Reputational risks may therefore arise if the Environmental and Climate Change targets are not achieved or fall short of stakeholder expectations. The Company recognizes the importance of building and enhancing a positive profile and improving public perception of the Company’s climate and environmental strategy. The Company contributes to global climate action while facilitating the transition to a low-carbon future and working to maintain regular contact with stakeholders and provide timely and balanced information on the Company’s Environmental and Climate Change targets, as well as on its progress towards achieving them.
Physical risks. 
Chronic risk. 
A gradual change in climate and weather conditions may affect the Company’s operations. NOVATEK assesses and considers these risks and the implications of climate change at project design, construction and operation stages as its core production assets are located in the sensitive subarctic environment of Russia’s Far Northern permafrost region.
The permafrost conditions of the fields are vulnerable to industrial impacts. Field development plans provide for relevant actions to prevent thermal impact of the facilities on deep-frozen soil (including cryological monitoring and thermal protection of permafrost soils for pile foundations).
Higher global average temperatures may lead to more frequent forest fires, with smoke and fire affecting nearby industrial facilities.
Acute risk. 
Risks of lightning strikes, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and other natural disasters are considered at the project design, construction and operation stages at least once every two years when identifying and assessing the risks (surveying) related to NOVATEK’s core production assets. To identify and evaluate risks, NOVATEK engages an expert organization using maps of natural hazards and natural peril datasets from Munich Re reinsurance company, as well as Russia’s construction standards (SNiP, GOST, and RUE). This physical risk can be acute primarily due to the increasing frequency of extreme weather phenomena, such as hurricanes, storms, strong winds, floods, and lightning strikes. Over time, it is planned to pay more attention to monitoring such extreme weather phenomena.

Climate Protection Initiatives. 
APG utilization program. 
The Company makes every effort to utilize associated petroleum gas. In 2020, we implemented a technology for deep APG injection at the Yarudeyskoye field. This allowed to cut our GHG emissions by 1.2 mmt of CO2 equivalent – a major environmental benefit achieved through re-injection of over 357 mmcm in the Yarudeyskoye field formations in 2020.
As a result, NOVATEK’s APG utilization rate achieved 96.17% in 2020. This is a substantial improvement compared to the previous year.
The Company aims to increase APG utilization rate to 99% by 2030.
Cogeneration technology at gas turbine power plants. 
Nearly all of the Group’s production facilities use the cogeneration (heat recovery) technology. Thermal efficiency is as high as 85–90%, reducing combustion product emissions, in particular GHG emissions. In 2020, GHG emissions were reduced by 101,656 tons of CO2 equivalent through cogeneration technologies.
Hydrogen production as a promising renewable. 
In 2020, NOVATEK began organizational changes for hydrogen production, including creation of a separate business unit (the Department for Alternative Energy & Offshore Technologies, which includes the Alternative Energy and Hydrogen Development Division) whose tasks include conceptual development and preparation for hydrogen production project implementation both within of existing projects (such as Yamal LNG) and new ones.
In 2020, we completed a conceptual evaluation of prospective projects for low-carbon (“blue”) hydrogen production from natural gas with carbon dioxide capture and utilization and the conversion of some of the existing gas turbines to a methane-hydrogen mix, as well as other projects for hydrogen production by electrolysis using renewable energy.
A conceptual evaluation of a prospective project for the large-scale production of low-carbon (“blue”) ammonia from natural gas with carbon dioxide capture and utilization is ongoing in 2021.
Also in 2021, NOVATEK will continue developing a medium- and long-term alternative energy strategy, with goals and objectives definition and project priority ranking and selection for implementation.
Carbon capture, utilization and storage in LNG production. 
NOVATEK is developing a concept for carbon dioxide capture, transportation and injection during LNG production. This is impeded by the fact that there are no governmental regulations for these activities at present. The Company contributes to the development of a licensing procedure for the underground storage of carbon dioxide and relevant amendments to the Law No. 2395-1 “On Subsoil” and the Federal Law No. 89-FZ “On Industrial and Consumer Waste” as well as applicable rules and regulations.
Use of renewables. 
The Company uses environmentally friendly renewable energy sources: solar panels and wind turbines. The total number of such renewable energy systems in 2020 was 148, reducing indirect emissions in power generation. Renewable sources of energy are used to supply power to telemechanics units at trunk pipelines and well pads at gas condensate fields.
In 2021, we plan to launch a wind measurement program near the existing Yamal LNG plant on the Yamal Peninsula in preparation for a wind farm project that will use the generated electricity to reduce the carbon footprint of the LNG produced at Yamal LNG.
Consideration of climate change scenarios. 
The Company considers climate change scenarios while designing the large-scale LNG projects Yamal LNG and Arctic LNG 2. The standard method to identify the climatic conditions under which LNG projects can be designed or to identify the realistic in-use climatic conditions for the equipment is the consideration of historical data as part of engineering and hydrometeorological surveys.
Global warming can potentially reduce ice thickness and the ice cover duration, which would lower overall logistics risks and the costs of LNG transportation.
For future LNG projects, the risk of climate warming will be considered on a project-specific basis.
Yamal LNG project. 
Yamal LNG design solutions capture the probability of climate warming and the resulting risks of building or structure foundation movements. The thermal calculations for foundations included: • data from global warming studies on the Yamal Peninsula, e.g. the air temperature rise between 1995 and 2018 was 0.7 °C (+ 0.028 °C per year); • research data on the forecast increase in the air temperature by 1.4 °C between 1995 and 2050 (+0.025 °C per year).
Air temperature is one of the key drivers affecting performance of LNG plant liquefaction trains. The assumed maximum ambient air temperature of +15 °C is used when designing air coolers, which have a significant impact on performance. The choice of this temperature is determined by the optimal CAPEX/operational performance ratio.
According to meteorological studies, the maximum ambient air temperature at the Yamal LNG project is assumed to be +30 °С while the maximum temperature of +29.7 °С throughout the project’s implementation and operation period was recorded in July 2016.
Actual observations since 2014 reveal that the average daily temperature reaches +15 °C for 8.9 days per year on average, or 2.4% of the total time. The average daily temperature reaches +14 °C for 13.7 days per year on average; accordingly, in the 1 °C scenario, the number of days when production would be constrained by air cooling capabilities is estimated to increase by 4.8 days, or 1.3%.

Environmental Impact Identification (ENVID) is a powerful method for analyzing the environmental and social impacts and risks at various stages of designing or during the operation of existing industrial facilities. 3. Pavlov A.V., Monitoring kriolitozony (Cryolithozone Monitoring). – Moscow: Russian Academy of Sciences, 2008.
The potential reduction in annual LNG production under this scenario is below 1%.
The design capacity of the project’s three liquefaction trains is 16.5 mmt of LNG per year. The actually annual capacity of the three trains is more than 18.2 mmtpa, which is 10% higher than the design capacity, which has been achieved through an increase in actual equipment reliability and improved performance during the cold season (from October to May, inclusive). This capacity margin is many times greater than the potential risk of lost productivity under potential climate change scenarios.
In addition, usually the trains are shut down for scheduled maintenance in summer, which further reduces the impact of climate change.
Arctic LNG 2 project. 
The Arctic LNG 2 project involves the construction of the Utrenniy terminal and three LNG and stable gas condensate production trains on gravity-based structures (GBS) resting in their design position on the seabed, and the potential rise of soil temperatures does not pose a risk to the integrity of these facilities.
The potential climate change risks for GBS were identified and analyzed within the HAZID1 and ENVID2 procedures, with their results reflected in the design.
Our thermal engineering calculations for onshore building or structure foundations reflect the expected increase in the average air temperature of 0.043 °C per year, which completely covers global warming assumptions3.
Although the natural gas liquefaction solutions used at Arctic LNG 2 differ from technologies used at Yamal LNG, an additional capacity margin is also projected for the former project during the cold season. The actual capacity margin of the liquefaction trains will be determined during operation of the project.

1. Novatek Polska prior to 3 February 2020. 2. The term “carbon-neutral” means that Novatek Green Energy compensated for the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from the following scopes: upstream transport of LNG from the supply source at LNG terminals in Europe to the fueling station, fueling station operations and the final consumption of LNG by end-customers.
Fueling station network development and transition to NGV fuel. 
NOVATEK’s strategy as a natural gas and LNG producer calls for active development of the natural gas vehicle (NGV) fuel market natural both in Russia and abroad. This market segment represents significant growth potential, given increasingly stringent environmental standards. Compared to diesel, LNG produces much less nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide emissions, with almost no particulate emissions.
As part of NOVATEK’s long-term strategy, the Company plans to build a network of LNG fueling stations in Europe to provide freight transport with clean fuel at key transport connecting points between Germany and Poland. As at the end of January 2021, the Company owned a network of 9 LNG fueling stations as well as 21 regasification units on the European market.
In December 2020, Novatek Green Energy1 opened its first carbon-neutral2 LNG fueling station in Rostock, Germany. The carbon footprint of the LNG sold to consumers, including its final consumption, is compensated through carbon offsetting. A carefully selected portfolio of emission compensation projects includes wind generation projects in developing countries. The emission compensation projects were certified in accordance with the international VCS (Verified Carbon Standard).
On the domestic market, NOVATEK is implementing a project for the sale of LNG as a motor fuel. In August 2020, the first small-scale 40 mtpa LNG plant was launched in Magnitogorsk (Chelyabinsk Region).
By the end of 2020, NOVATEK had a total of 11 LNG retail stations (of which 9 were built during the year) in the Ural, Northwestern, Central and Volga Federal Districts. In 2020, fueling station sales increased from 70 tons per month in January 2020 to 540 tons per month in December 2020, with the number of LNG-fueled vehicles up from 30 to 500, including semi-trailer tractors, urban passenger transport and haul trucks. The Company has approved the SmallScale LNG Investment Project to build 7 small-scale LNG plants. By 2026, LNG as a NGV fuel is planned to be sold from 66 LNG fueling stations. Fueling infrastructure development aims to cover key Russia’s federal highways M-10, M-11, M-4, M-5, M-7, and the Central Circular Road.
LNG transportation by sea. 
Yamalmax LNG tankers sailing on the Northern Sea Route for the Yamal LNG project have Wartsila 12V50DF and Wartsila 9L50DF engines with a total power of 39.6 MW (Christophe de Margerie, the lead ship in the series with a capacity of 172,845 cubic meters of LNG). These engines can run on both heavy marine fuel and boil-off gas (gas from an LNG recovery system with Cryostar compressors). Use of LNG as marine fuel reduces air emissions of combustion products, including greenhouse gases, from engines compared to heavy marine fuels (fuel oil).
The Arc7 ice-class LNG tankers can sail on the Northern Sea Route westward without any icebreaker support yearround and eastward with icebreakers assistance during months with difficult ice conditions. The carriers are powered by low-carbon gas generated by LNG cargo boiloff. The use of LNG carriers not only curbs greenhouse gas emissions, but also poses no risk of significant environmental disaster due to petroleum product spills.
Furthermore, the use of the Northern Sea Route reduces the Company’s shipping times and costs, which is crucial for the development of the fields on the Yamal and Gydan Peninsulas. For example, shipping times to Asia are accelerated by over 40% which also contributes to reducing the climate footprint of product transportation.
Decarbonization partnerships. 
NOVATEK is seeking partnerships to reduce its carbon footprint.
To that end, in 2020, NOVATEK concluded an agreement with Siemens Energy on strategic partnership for LNG production decarbonization. The companies will work together to develop and launch high-tech solutions to produce LNG, electricity, hydrogen and other products in order to support sustainable development and meet the companies’ goals of reducing their carbon footprint and improving environmental efficiency. As part of this agreement, the companies have agreed to launch a project to replace natural gas used as fuel in power generation and LNG with carbon-neutral hydrogen.
In early 2021, the Company also signed a memorandum on decarbonization with the NLMK Group, a major consumer of NOVATEK products. The memorandum confirms the companies’ intention to cooperate in carbon dioxide capture, utilization and storage, hydrogen production technology development and hydrogen fuel usage, as well as development of new products for low-carbon technologies.
In early 2021, NOVATEK and Uniper signed a Memorandum of Understanding to explore and assess capabilities of building a hydrogen supply chain. The companies intend to develop an integrated chain of hydrogen production, transportation, and supply, including to Uniper power plants in Russia and Western Europe. We also consider the idea of supplying “blue” hydrogen produced from natural gas with CO2 capture and storage, as well as “green” hydrogen produced with renewables.
Also in 2021, a strategic cooperation agreement on reducing CO2 emissions was concluded between NOVATEK and Nuovo Pignone, a subsidiary of Baker Hughes, to cooperate in the development of electric and gasturbine solutions for gas production and liquefaction and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions.

Permafrost. 
NOVATEK’s main production facilities are located in Russia’s Far North, an Arctic zone with harsh climate and permafrost environment (cryolithozone). The Company evaluates implications for its operations, conducts geotechnical and environmental monitoring, develops a GHG emissions reporting system, and uses innovative technologies to reduce emissions. NOVATEK made a voluntary commitment to regulate its GHG emissions and permafrost footprint and make every effort to reduce adverse impacts on the atmosphere.
NOVATEK follows the precautionary principle in all operations. Based on environmental risk assessment across the entire process chain, the Company takes preventative measures and incorporates potential threat assessment into its decision-making process. Environmental and social requirements of international lenders, such as the Equator Principles and the standards of the International Finance Corporation, have already been adopted and will be diligently followed within NOVATEK. Prior to launching projects we conduct environmental and social impact assessments1.
The Yamal LNG and Arctic LNG 2 projects are operated in extremely harsh conditions of the Arctic coast where the annual temperature range is lower than in continental Siberia: winter temperatures range from –20 °C to –35 °C and summer temperatures range from +10 °C to +20 °C. Air temperature rises above zero during only four months of the year, from June to September.
1. Environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) documentation is available on Yamal LNG and Arctic LNG 2 project official sites.
To prevent possible adverse consequences of changes in permafrost condition, appropriate measures are taken at the Company’s fields to make sure subsoil under buildings and structures remains frozen.
The most common technology for keeping soils frozen is using of tubular liquid or vapor-liquid devices called heat pipes. These are placed in the subsoil in vertical wells (in case of pile foundations and vented crawl space) or horizontally/obliquely (in case of structures with slab-on-grade floors) to minimize thermal influence of the structure. A conventional heat pipe consists of two principal elements: an underground evaporator and an above-ground condenser. Various liquids or gases can be used as coolants. In winter, the coolant (refrigerant) condenses, resulting in “transfer of cold” from the atmosphere to the ground by gravity. Then, in the heat exchange process, the coolant evaporates, rising to the condenser, and the cycle repeats. As a result, a significant decrease in the temperature of the ground is observed in winter. In summer, when the ambient temperature rises, the condensation process stops, and that causes the stoppage of the coolant circulation inside the heat pipe. The process stabilizes soil temperature and improves its bearing capacity within the area affected by the heat pipe.
Depending on geotechnical environment and foundation design, different options of heat pipe laying can be used: vertical, horizontal, inclined or a combination thereof.
One of the ways to significantly reduce impacts on permafrost is to build structures on pile foundations with vented crawl space. The Yamal LNG project installed more than 38,000 piles to eliminate any risks of thawing and adverse environmental consequences. This number of piles is unprecedented in the history of completed projects and far above what is required by Russian technical standards as a margin of safety.
Aside from pile foundations, we use sand fill. Permafrost on the Yamal Peninsula is up to 400 meters deep, while the top 1.5–2 meters of soil are an “active layer”, which thaws in summer and freezes again in winter. Sand fill stops seasonal thawing and freezing under the fill, and heat pipes prevent thawed soil layer expansion, thus increasing structural stability and reliability.
Permafrost condition is controlled through geotechnical monitoring by measuring soil temperatures down to the pile tip depth during construction and operation of structures. Temperatures are measured by temperature sensor strings in special thermometric wells directly beneath the structures. A temperature sensor string is a chain of digital temperature transducers connected in series by a flexible cable. Yamal LNG performs this type of monitoring in over 2,500 wells under all structures. The largest of them, such as LNG tanks, have more than 20 temperature sensor strings under each tank. All strings are regularly inspected, with readings entered into special tables (geo-engineering certificates of facilities), enabling identification of any deviations. There are several ways to respond to geo-technical monitoring data, including temperature changes. Generalized thermometry data are used to build heat maps (for areal facilities) and heat profiles (for linear facilities), i.e. fields and sections of soil temperature at a given depth across the entire facility as isolines superimposed on the facility plot plan. The images are used to identify high temperature zones as well as the cause of temperature rise (a heat source or conditions disturbing natural soil temperature distribution). Response depends on the identified cause and can include changes to the facility operation, better thermal insulation of buildings and structures, adding heat pipes, snow cover “management” (for example, snow removal in early winter to increase frost depth).
Engineering and design of each NOVATEK’s facility includes stability testing by the Company’s contractors for various climate warming scenarios. For example, the Yamal LNG buildings and structures were designed with allowance for potential air temperature rise scenarios (by 4 °C compared to the current levels) and the associated warming of the soil layers (by 2 °C), therefore, underlying soil design and preparation allows potential warming. In addition, permafrost sensitivity analysis was conducted for scenarios of potential rise in average air temperature by 2 °C and 4 °C and soil temperature by 1 °C and 2 °C, respectively (for the period from 1999 to 2019). Measurements at special background sites and weather stations indicate that the situation is currently developing according to the most favorable scenario.
A geocryological map and a construction complexity map were created for Yamal LNG and Arctic LNG 2 to identify areas with higher construction risks.
Thermal insulation of strong heat sources offers additional protection. In particular, wide use of PENOPLEX XPS at Yamal LNG significantly reduced thermal impact from such sources as the LNG plant flare, buried tanks and others, as evidenced by temperature measurement data.

Sustainability Report 2020 THINK GREEN. THINK NATURAL GAS.


NOVATEK’s second large-capacity LNG project, Arctic LNG 2, will be the first LNG plant in Russia and worldwide on a gravity-base structure (GBS), where new technologies will significantly reduce the project capital intensity and minimize its environmental footprint. The GBS platform is not supported by piles as it is rests on the seabed close to the shoreline. By using the GBS platform, the Company minimizes impact on permafrost. Furthermore, Arctic LNG 2 is designed for the worst-case scenarios of climate change.
Field infrastructure development plans provide for prevention of thermal impact from field facilities on permafrost. NOVATEK uses regular geotechnical monitoring of its fields to manage this risk, adapt to it and prevent potential adverse consequences as well as to monitor soil bearing capacity and permafrost conditions and temperature.
Geotechnical monitoring consists in measuring soil temperature under all facilities (both production and nonproduction) – from dormitories and canteens to tanks and compressors – at specified intervals. Monitoring data and identified causes (natural or anthropogenic) determine measures to be taken to prevent soil thawing. Such prevention measures include soil temperature stabilization and use of piles in construction.
Geotechnical monitoring shows that permafrost thawing risk is currently under control.
An indicator of the current condition of foundations is foundation deformations monitored on a regular basis. Deformation measurements are also entered into the geotechnical certificates of structures. Should any changes be identified, they are evaluated against design tolerances, deformation trends are determined, the data are compared with thermometry and visual inspection data to make a decision on further action.
Monitoring of long linear facilities additionally includes route surveys with the collection of data on the facility and natural and anthropogenic conditions along its entire length.
It should also be noted that projects are run in close cooperation with the leading experts in permafrost, such as: Oil and Gas Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Gersevanov Research Institute of Bases and Underground Structures, to name a few. The cooperation includes expeditions, technical calculations, geocryological forecasting, and evaluation of current parameters of natural-anthropogenic interaction.

Geocryological risk assessment. 
The main risk to integrity of buildings and infrastructure is associated with potential destabilizing of the frozen soil foundations. Since all facilities are designed to minimize their impact on permafrost and use temperature stabilization and geotechnical monitoring, the likelihood of this risk is evaluated as medium. This evaluation is confirmed at least four times a year based on data on the current condition of facilities. In addition, Guidelines for the Evaluation and Prevention of Technical and Geocryological Risks on the South-Tambeyskoye Field were developed to inform employees designing, building and operating facilities on the field of measures to prevent these risks.
As the most of the Company’s production facilities are in the Russian Arctic, prediction and monitoring of permafrost condition and cryogenic processes is an important consideration during pre-project surveying, engineering and design, construction and operation of buildings and structures. Special measures are implemented to maintain soil stability and bearing capacity both on areal and linear facilities on sites with 1. Data for Arctic LNG 2 are given at the time of construction.
confirmed presence of permafrost. The facilities are also provided with means to monitor soil and facility temperatures and movements (geotechnical monitoring). Project implementation (both during surveys and operation), special attention is paid to identification and prediction of such cryolithozone hazards as frost mounds, gas hydrates and cryopegs. Advanced engineering technologies, thermal calculations and subsequent verification through geotechnical monitoring enable high-quality assessment of permafrost and facility condition. In addition, an industrial (local) environmental monitoring program includes identification of active cryogenic process – frost cracking, cryokarst and thermoerosion, frost have and other forms of permafrost evolution and degradation. In 2020, these studies covered several license areas in the Yamal and Tazovsky Districts of the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region. Combined with the geotechnical monitoring results, the studies provide an objective representation of permafrost conditions in the Company’s regions of operation.
Monitoring of geological environments as well as buildings and structures during construction and operation in the cryolithozone by NOVATEK shows that permafrost thawing and degradation risk is currently low and has no significant impact on the Company’s operations.

By 2030, we plan to obtain 100% certification of all subsidiaries and joint ventures for compliance with internationally recognized environmental management requirements.
102‑11 In its environmental protection efforts, the Company applies the Precautionary Principle or Precautionary Approach – one of the fundamental principles of international environmental law set forth in the Preamble to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, which states that lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minimize a threat of significant reduction or loss of biological diversity. For NOVATEK, following this principle in real-life practice means that based on its assessment of environmental risks across the entire production chain, the Company takes preventive measures and incorporates potential threats into decision-making. Specifically, since most of the Company’s assets are concentrated in sensitive permafrost areas, the precautionary approach calls for the identification, assessment, prediction, and accounting for engineering and environmental risks from global climate change and permafrost degradation.
With regard to biodiversity components, the precautionary approach is implemented through the Company’s integrated environmental monitoring programs, which have a wider geography and increased thematic scope, and actively involve research, engineering and non-governmental organizations.
In addition, the precautionary approach expands the requirements for assessing the impact of intended activities on the natural and social environment. A number of global standards require repeated assessments to be prepared where the impacts of third-party activities may compound those of the main project (so-called cumulative impacts).
The effectiveness of the environmental measures implemented by the Company is monitored by Russian and, for some projects, international organizations.
The Company engages in extensive cooperation with research and non-governmental environmental organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF), Marine Mammal Council (Russian Federation), and V.I. Vernadsky Non-Governmental Environmental Foundation. In addition, prior to the start of new construction or modernization of existing facilities and as part of state environmental reviews, NOVATEK holds public consultations with local communities in the regions of its operations. As an example, environmental and social impact assessment, disclosure and discussion of its results with stakeholders, and obtaining approvals from competent authorities – all are key to implementing the Company’s Yamal LNG and Arctic LNG 2 projects.
In 2020, NOVATEK subsidiaries and joint ventures held a total of 24 public consultations to discuss the results of environmental impact assessments (EIAs) for future projects in the Nadymsky, Yamalsky, Tazovsky and Purovsky Districts of the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region, and in the Kingiseppsky District of the Leningrad Region. In particular, communities discussed projects for surveys, brownfield expansion and field facility construction, as well as overhaul of processing facilities. Participants in the public consultations had the opportunity to read the EIA documents and get answers to their questions and express their own views about the proposed activity, including by voting. All of these projects secured the public endorsement as shown by the majority voting of participants.
COVID-19 restrictions in 2020 had only a minimal impact on the effectiveness of environmental support for the Group projects. Thus, rather than arranging traditional meetings with local communities and other stakeholders, discussions of the EIA results moved online, leveraging various remote collaboration tools, including video conferencing. The high technical level of workplace setups of Company specialists and municipal administrations organizing these meetings enabled us to safely run all statutory procedures for disclosing and discussing EIA documentation and considering stakeholder feedback and suggestions related to new projects.
The Company’s hydrocarbon production, transportation, processing, storage and shipment activities at all stages – from project initiation to completion – are accompanied by comprehensive environmental support aimed at identification, assessment and mitigation of environmental risks. The elements of this support include engineering and environmental surveys, environmental impact assessment, design of environmental measures, environmental review, environmental monitoring and control, and various formats of interaction with supervising authorities and other stakeholders during environmental management.
NOVATEK’s Strategic Targets in Environmental Protection. 
In 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted Environmental and Climate Change targets for the period up to 2030. The year 2019 was adopted as the baseline for the development of the targets. To improve the accuracy of measuring the achievement of long-term Environmental and Climate Change targets, additional annual environmental and climate-related annual estimates were introduced, considering the Company’s potential growth. NOVATEK plans to allocate RR 12.4 bln for the implementation of measures towards Environmental and Climate Change targets in 2021–2023.
In 2020, the Company consistently focused on working towards interim milestones for its environmental targets: • By increasing APG injection for pressure maintenance, we reduced GHG emissions in 2020, as indicated by GHG emissions per unit of production in the upstream segment. We achieved out target and even exceeded it by 26% vs. the 2020 estimate. The Group’s operations use cogeneration technology, almost doubling fuel efficiency to achieve lower fuel gas consumption and a significant reduction in GHG emissions. In 2020, GHG emissions were reduced by 101,656 tons of CO2 equivalent through cogeneration technologies.
• By transitioning to direct measurements of pollutants at the emission sources the target for air pollutant emissions per unit of production was achieved (exceeding the 2020 estimate by 4%).
• Some estimates, though, were not achieved in 2020: in particular, the share of waste directed to utilization and disposal were below the 2020 estimate (missed by 8%). This was due to delayed arrivals of contractors to facilities amid COVID-19 restrictions and subsequent temporary suspension of waste recycling.
• Methane emissions per unit of production exceeded the 2020 estimate by 5% due to increased methane emissions as a result of production capacity growth. The North-Russkoye and East-Tazovskoye fields came onstream in 2020 as additional sources of emissions.
To achieve our targets, in 2020, we launched a project to inject APG for pressure maintenance at the Yarudeyskoye field and implemented instrumental verifications of pollutant emissions at NOVATEK-Ust-Luga.
In 2021, the following measures are planned to achieve the targets: • commissioning of additional capacity for low-pressure APG compression; • phasing out burning in horizontal gas flaring systems; • reduction of air emissions during gas- and gascondensate well tests; • installation of flares for sootless flaring; and • switching to a new methodology for calculating flare emissions that factors in air injection into the combustion zone.
In 2020, the Company’s total environmental costs amounted to RR 2.4 bln (up 67% year-on-year). The largest increase was in the costs of land and soil protection (4.3 times), followed by water protection (2.5 times) and biodiversity conservation (1.7 times).

Due to COVID-19 restrictions, training and testing were organized remotely, enabled by the high technical level of workplace setups.
As in previous years, managers at various levels of the organization and young specialists involved in environmental support for the Group’s projects also took advanced training programs.
The need for additional health protection and healthcare support measures in 2020 necessitated upskilling for a number of medical waste management professionals.
In addition, integrated management (including environmental management) system implementation by subsidiaries and joint ventures called for additional training efforts: in 2020, more than 60 specialists underwent training and certification in this area.

Environmental Monitoring and Control. 
Annual environmental monitoring is a key tool for environmental assessment at production sites, identification of challenges, and timely adjustment of the environmental policy. The Company runs its annual environmental monitoring program across its production footprint. The monitoring is carried out by independent environmental auditors (hiring qualified experts and having relevant licenses) as per applicable programs and methodologies.
It involves examining the condition of environment components, taking snow, soil, ground, surface/ground water and seabed sediment samples, checking the condition of the local flora, animals and microorganisms, estimating air pollution, studying and recording signs of dangerous exogenous processes (including cryogenic) and hydrological phenomena. The status of fish stock and fodder resources in water areas is studied along with hydrological and hydrochemical parameters. Samples are studied in certified laboratories. Based on the study results, the condition of the environment components is evaluated as well as its dynamic pattern over the year.
The visual part of the monitoring involves inspection and photographing of the areas along cross-country routes. To run the environmental monitoring in the tundra zone, we use transport with low-pressure tires to preserve the fragile topsoil.
The Company conducts integrated environmental assessments of its territories of operation to curb its environmental footprint and maintain local ecosystems in a satisfactory condition.
These assessments help identify the overall situation around polluting facilities on a fivethreshold scale: • 1–1.51 – background pollution (good); • 1.5–2.5 – low pollution (satisfactory); • 2.5–3.5 – moderate pollution (nonhazardous); • 3.5–4.5 – high pollution (hazardous); and • 4.5 and more – extremely high pollution (critical).
In general, in 2020, the studies showed that the conditions of environmental components in the target 1. The scale does not include the upper value. 2. Details of biodiversity components monitoring efforts are available in the OG4 section. 3. The calculation is based on the Company’s proportional share in joint ventures, for more details see p. 99.
sections of 38 fields and license areas were satisfactory with a low level of environmental pollution. Integrated assessment was performed using a set of five indicators: • total snow cover pollution index; • surface water pollution index; • bottom sediment characteristics in terms of petroleum products content; • total soil pollution index; and • soil characteristics by the content of petroleum products.
In 2020, the Group spent RR 134 mln to arrange and run environmental monitoring in areas potentially impacted by its projects2.
To reduce the negative impact on the environment, a multitier environmental operational control system is in place at the Company’s subsidiaries and joint ventures. The majority of NOVATEK’s large production subsidiaries and joint ventures have a chemical laboratory fully equipped for prompt operational analysis. The environmental operational control system feeds data to analyze and streamline our core processes.
In 2020, the Federal Service for Supervision of Natural Resources (Rosprirodnadzor), Federal Agency for Fishery, Russian regional executive authorities and public prosecution offices held scheduled and ad-hoc audits at major production NOVATEK subsidiaries and joint ventures with respect to environment protection and sustainable management of natural resources.
In 2020, 108 audits were held with respect to environment protection and sustainable management of natural resources: 53% were audits by the Federal Service for Supervision of Natural Resources and 41% were audits by Russian regional public prosecution offices with 6% performed by other authorities.
Following the audits, measures were taken to eliminate the deficiencies identified.
307‑1 In 2020, the Company was fined for a total of around RR 1.66 mln for environmental breaches3, avoiding administrative punishments such as projects suspensions.

Energy Consumption and Efficiency4. 
The rational use of resources is one of the key principles of NOVATEK’s energy policy. The Company pays close attention to reducing the consumption of fuel and energy resources and improving the energy efficiency of technological processes and equipment used, as well as to using modern highly efficient technologies when developing design solutions and technical requirements for equipment, especially under new investment projects.
The Company widely applies wellknown advanced technical solutions aimed at improving energy efficiency, including: • frequency-controlled electric drives for pumping and compressor equipment; • efficient automatically controlled electric lighting and electric heating systems; and • LED lighting installations, cogeneration technologies.
In its operations, NOVATEK adheres to federal energy efficiency regulations (Federal Law No. 261-FZ “On Energy Saving and Energy Efficiency Improvement”, Resolution of the Russian Government No. 600 “On Approving the List of Facilities and Technologies Designated as High Energy Efficiency Facilities and Technologies”, to name a few).
A number of NOVATEK subsidiaries and joint ventures implement an annual energy saving and energy efficiency improvement program to enhance the energy efficiency of production activities and reduce the amount of resources used. The program comprises measures to introduce energy-saving technologies and new energy-efficient equipment, as well as organizational and technical measures aimed at reducing energy consumption in all areas of production activities.
The energy management system is based on consumption planning and metering, analysis of actual results, and adjustment of consumption plans.
The Company consumes electricity (17% purchased, 83% own generation) and heat (own production, mostly using secondary energy resources (heat from flue gases) and fuel gas).
In 2021, the following targets for energy efficiency and the use of renewable sources of energy were adopted under the UN’s priority SDG No. 7, Affordable and Clean Energy: • expand the use of renewables for gas and condensate production facilities; • use energy-efficient LNG production technologies to increase the availability of LNG and reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and • continuously improve energy efficiency of hydrocarbon production and processing.
302‑4 Energy-saving initiatives implemented by NOVATEK in 2020 enabled an overall reduction in energy consumption by 30,500 GJ due to an 8.4 mln kWh reduction in electricity consumption, which accounted for 0.3% of the total electricity consumption by the Group. Initial values posted prior to the implementation of energy efficiency improvement initiatives are used as the basis to calculate consumption reductions.
The principles of efficient use of energy resources are laid down at the design stage of new technological facilities through the use of modern technologies and equipment.
OG3 The Company uses environmentally safe renewable sources of energy based on solar modules and wind turbines. Small-capacity renewable sources of energy are used to supply power to telemechanics units at trunk pipelines and well pads at gas condensate fields. The total number of such renewable energy systems in 2020 was 148, up 16 year-on-year.
In 2020, we generated a total of 222,000 kWh of electricity from renewable sources (146,000 kWh 96 97. 
Sustainability Report 2020 THINK GREEN. THINK NATURAL GAS.


and 76,000 kWh by solar modules and wind turbines, respectively), representing 0.01% of NOVATEK’s total electricity generation.
OG2 Investments in renewable energy include the cost of constructing renewable sources of energy to supply power to telemechanics units at trunk pipelines and well pads at gas condensate fields under new investment projects. Renewable sources of energy as an alternative to overhead power lines are applied with an appropriate economic justification for facilities located in remote areas.
The Company also widely uses secondary energy resources – heat from flue gases of gas turbines and gas engine generators. Heat generation from secondary energy resources is an energy-saving cogeneration technology, reducing the consumption of primary energy resources (fuel gas). In 2020, heat generation from secondary energy resources amounted to 2,012 thousand GJ, which accounted for 68% of the total heat consumption.
1. Energy consumption for 2020 includes the following companies: NOVATEK-Yurkharovneftegas, NOVATEK-Tarkosaleneftegas, NOVATEKPurovsky ZPK, NOVATEK-Ust-Luga, NOVATEK-Transervice, NOVATEK-Pur (included in 2019), Arcticgas, Nortgas, Yargeo, Terneftegas, Cryogas-Vysotsk (included in 2019), Yamal LNG, Arctic LNG 2 (included in 2020), and NOVATEK-Murmansk (included in 2020). 2. The increase in energy consumption in 2020 is due to the inclusion of data on consumption by Arctic LNG 2 and NOVATEK-Murmansk, as well as the commissioning of new facilities at the North-Russkiy cluster. 3. Gas and condensate production energy intensity excluding Yamal LNG. 4. Including Yamal LNG.
The use of secondary energy resources drove a 54 mmcm reduction in fuel gas consumption in 2020.
Specific energy consumption, defined as the ratio of electricity consumption to production volume (the volume of produced gas in mcm, the volume of condensate, oil and LNG in tons), is used to assess the energy intensity of technological processes.

Broad application of cogeneration in technological processes of natural gas compression and electricity generation produces an integrated effect, reducing both fuel gas consumption for heat generation and greenhouse gas emissions.
In 2020, estimated fuel gas savings due to cogeneration technologies amounted to 54 mmcm.
Air Emissions. 
The environmental performance data was calculated based on the Company’s proportional share in joint ventures: 50% in Arcticgas, 50% in Nortgas, 51% in Terneftegas, 60% in Arctic LNG 2, and 51% in CryogasVysotsk. The calculation for Yamal LNG and Sabetta International Airport with the Company’s share at 50.1% is based on 60% share due to production of the SouthTambeyskoye field developed by Yamal LNG reported at 60% including an additional 9.9% interest not owned by the Group, since the Group assumes certain economic and operational risks related to this interest. Energy efficiency data is calculated based on 100% Company’s share.
305‑6 Atmospheric air protection is one of the focus areas of the Company’s environmental activities, requiring special attention. The Company does not emit highly toxic and ozone-depleting substances, and there are no hazardous air pollutants in the Company’s emissions.
The Company set a long-term target of 20% reduction in air pollutant emissions per unit of production by 2030 compared to the 2019 baseline.
The Company strives to minimize emissions and ensures that emergency emission risks are accounted for at the earliest stages of project design. Emergency emission prevention is included in FEED and detailed documentation for field development and construction of hazardous production facilities. Construction of new buildings and structures requires, as and when stipulated by applicable Russian laws, positive conclusion of a state environmental review and chief state review of engineering survey and design documentation. All projects must include provisions for preventing emergency emissions, fires, spills, and other emergencies by various safety systems such as emergency protection, automatic fire suppression, and gas detection systems. Additionally, all NOVATEK’s production facilities undergo annual preventive maintenance, as well as conduct diagnostics of their equipment and pipelines to prevent loss of containment and hydrocarbon emissions.
Approved environmental monitoring programs stipulate yearly measurement of emissions from equipment, including but not limited to: • booster compressor stations; • gas turbine power plants; and • furnaces, heaters.
Cryogas-Vysotsk operates an automatic system to monitor industrial emissions, including greenhouse gases (GHG). Universal advantages of automatic emission monitoring systems include higher reproducibility of measurements, uniform data acquisition, processing and visualization algorithms, lower labor intensity and lower risk for personnel in hazardous areas, as well as monitoring continuity.
The Company runs a Lean Production program to eliminate air emissions: sustainable use of formation water (injection to maintain formation pressure) eliminates previously used formation water flaring.

GHG emissions 305‑1 The Company’s subsidiaries successfully implemented the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Management System Standard, which establishes key principles and requirements for GHG emissions management in subsidiaries and joint ventures. The Company’s corporate GHG Emissions Management System is tailored to its production processes, feedstock composition and equipment. The system complies with ISO 14064-1:2007 and Russian Government Resolution No. 504-R dated 2 April 2014, as well as the Guidelines for Calculating GHG Emissions approved by Order No. 300 of the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment dated 30 June 2015. GHG emissions were calculated in accordance with the technique approved by Order No. 300 of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment dated 30 June 2015 “On the Approval of Recommended Practices and Guidelines for the Measurement of GHG Emissions by Business and Other Entities Operating in the Russian Federation”.
305‑1 In 2020, direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) totaled 9,055,750 tons of CO2 equivalent. Scope 1 emissions from stationary combustion, including flaring, totaled 8,852,968 tons of CO2 equivalent, fugitive emissions totaled 166,816 tons of CO2 equivalent with other emissions at 35,966 tons of CO2 equivalent.
305‑2 Location-based energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions totaled 228,498 tons of CO2 equivalent, including emissions in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region (Ural Interconnected Power System, Tyumen Region): 204,184 tons of CO2 equivalent; and the Leningrad Region (North-West Interconnected Power System): 24,314 tons of CO2 equivalent.
In 2021, an independent audit by Bureau Veritas Certification Rus verifying data on 2020 Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions was performed. Bureau Veritas Certification Rus confirmed the compliance of NOVATEK’s 1. The increase in specific air emissions in 2020 was driven by production capacity growth. The North-Russkoye and East-Tazovskoye fields came onstream in 2020 as additional sources of emissions. 2. Scope 3 GHG emissions from the use of Company’s production volumes were calculated for the first time ever in 2020. The calculations used Scope 3 Accounting and Reporting Standard of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, version 1.0, with the assumption for category 11 (Use of sold products) that all production volumes were combusted 3. 2019 is the base year for the long-term targets.

305‑3 In 2020, Scope 3 GHG emissions (indirect emissions from the use of Company’s production volumes) totaled 173,250,940 tons of CO2 equivalent2.
NOVATEK sets both short and long-term targets for reducing GHG emissions intensity.
The short-term target is to keep specific emissions below the levels of the base year: 2016 for hydrocarbon production, 2017 for hydrocarbon processing, and 2018 for LNG production. GHG specific emissions in 2020 did not exceed these baselines.
Long-term targets to be achieved by 2030 are to reduce Scope 1 GHG emissions from the base year3, namely: • reduce methane emissions per unit of production in the production, processing and LNG segments by 4%; • reduce GHG emissions per unit of production in the upstream segment by 6%; and • reduce GHG emissions per ton of LNG produced by 5%.

Direct GHG emissions in 2020 by source type (Scope 1), tons of CO2 equivalent Methane emissions per unit of production for production, processing and LNG facilities in 2018-2020, tons/mmboe 305‑4 In 2020, specific GHG emissions stood at 8.65 tons of CO2 equivalent per mboe for production facilities, 0.031 tons of CO2 equivalent per ton of processed hydrocarbons for processing facilities, and 0.24 tons of CO2 equivalent per ton of LNG for LNG production facilities.
In 2020, methane emissions from production grew by 30% year-on-year to 8,390.8 tons, while emissions from processing decreased 5% year-on-year to 84.0 tons. The increase in methane emissions in 2020 was driven by production capacity growth. The North-Russkoye and East-Tazovskoye fields came onstream in 2020 as additional sources of emissions.
The Company had no accidents with methane leaks in 2020.
305‑5 Associated petroleum gas. 
The Company makes every effort to use associated petroleum gas (APG) efficiently.The Company set a target to increase the APG utilization rate to 99% by 2030.
In 2020, NOVATEK pushed efficient APG use to 96.17%, a significant year-on-year improvement, 5.1 bcm of APG were used efficiently, while close proximity of natural gas treatment facilities enables gas treatment to the requirements of STO Gazprom 089-2010 and sale through a trunk gas pipeline system. A synergy of oil and gas treatment and transportation facilities enables economic production of APG.
In order to comply with the governmental requirement to utilize at least 95% of APG, NOVATEK commissioned booster compressor stations at its producing assets: NOVATEK-Tarkosaleneftegas, Yargeo and Arcticgas. With the new facilities, APG flaring does not exceed 5%, with minimal negative impact on the environment.
In 2020, a project to inject APG into deep absorbing horizons while producing oil from the Yarudeyskoye field helped Yargeo to achieve APG utilization target (95%), while cutting direct GHG emissions by 1.2 mmt of CO2 equivalent.
In addition, in 2020, a new technique to calculate pollutant emissions from APG combustion, developed on Yargeo’s initiative, was included in the official list of the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. This technique can be used not only at the Yarudeyskoye field but also on other fields where flares use extra air supply to reduce pollutant emissions and energy consumption.
Waste Generation and Management. 
NOVATEK uses a systemic approach to manage waste of hazard classes 1–5 throughout the life cycle, from providing safe temporary storage of waste to waste treatment, landfilling and utilization. The Company chooses the most advanced methods for waste reuse. NOVATEK uses the resource-based view of waste management to reuse waste, whenever possible, in manufacturing and business activities by finding consumers that can recycle the Company’ waste.
NOVATEK set a target to increase the share of waste directed to utilization and disposal to 90% by 2030 compared to the 2019 baseline.
306‑1 306‑2 The Company strives to increase waste recycling to mitigate potential impact on the environment. In 2020, a total of 879 tons of waste were reused, including 3 tons of waste paper and cardboard, 802 tons of ferrous and nonferrous scrap, 5 tons of spent batteries, 57 tons of spent industrial oils, and 13 tons of catalyst waste, which helped to prevent negative impacts on the environment.
The Company implements initiatives to reduce waste generation. For example, in 2020, the Group reused 2,491 cubic meters of industrial oils by using the TCC Hammer Mill system for thermal desorption of drilling waste.
In 2020, the Group’s operations generated 47,214 tons of waste, down 41% year-on-year. The share of very highly hazardous and highly hazardous waste (classes 1 and 2) was insignificant (below 0.1%), found mainly in mercury lamps and fluorescent tubes containing mercury, as well as spent lead-acid batteries. The rest was moderately hazardous and low-hazard waste of classes 3, 4 and 5. The bulk of waste was low-hazard or practically nonhazardous (mainly drill cuttings).
OG7 In 2020, well drilling for natural gas, gas condensate and oil by the Group generated 37,445 tons of drilling mud, of which 11,951 tons were treated and 20,517 tons were utilized. In order to reduce drilling waste impact on the environment, drilling mud is utilized by using thermal desorption and other physical and mechanical methods found to be acceptable by state environmental review. A unique drilling mud processing system at the Yurkharovskoye and South-Tambeyskoye fields effectively solved the problem of drilling mud utilization for drilling on the shore of Ob Bay, while providing significant environmental and economic benefits through the reuse of oil-base mud.
306‑3 All subsidiaries and joint ventures keep primary records of waste generation and movements to make sure waste data are available and traceable.
The Company does not transport, import, export or treat waste deemed hazardous under the terms of the Basel Convention Annexes I, II, III, and VIII, and does not ship such waste internationally.

306‑5 In 2020, a total of 3 tons of hazardous waste were treated, with 16,522 tons of non-hazardous waste treated, and 6,976 tons of non-hazardous waste landfilled.
The Company takes a responsible approach to waste disposal by compliance with approved instructions and generally accepted safety practices and by environmental monitoring of waste handling. In 2020, 2,275 tons of non-hazardous waste were landfilled within the Company’s premises, and 1,426 tons of waste were landfilled outside the Company’s premises by licensed contractors. 3,275 tons of non-hazardous waste were sent for storage in a specialized facilities both within and outside the Company’s premises. 16,525 tons of production and consumption waste were treated internally or by specialized contractors.
We have an ever-growing separate waste collection and disposal system deployed across operations. Leveraging this system, NOVATEK-Yurkharovneftegas, for instance, benefits from selling its waste after separate collection. The following types of waste were sold in 2020: waste oils, spent batteries, plastic containers, paper and cardboard waste, ferrous scrap, pipes, and catalysts. In 2020, NOVATEK extended the existing separate collection system rolled out across our operations to several more subsidiaries.

In 2020, specific water consumption by production facilities dropped 41% to 2.17 cubic meters per mboe, due to completion of an exploration well drilling in the water area. Specific water consumption by processing facilities dropped by 7% to 0.01 cubic meters per mt of products due to an increase of condensate processing volumes compared to water consumption.
Water discharge. 
The Company uses the following wastewater discharge destinations: • injection for pressure maintenance; • combustion in horizontal gas flare systems; • injection into formations with high injectivity; and • surface discharge.
In 2020, the Company’s total water discharge (excluding water injected for pressure maintenance) stood at 1,705 mcm, down 29% year-on-year.
303‑2 303‑4 630 mcm of wastewater treated to standard quality were discharged into water bodies. All wastewater undergoes primary treatment before any discharge, including flaring and injection. Requirements for effluent quality are set by applicable laws and regulations, including industry standards. These requirements are used to determine discharge limits for specific water bodies and get approvals for these limits from regulators. The Group observes established limits in all operations. Chemicals to be removed from contaminated water and removal requirements are determined in accordance with the applicable Russian laws and regulations using the riskbased approach, followed by water treatment to remove these chemicals. Discharged wastewater is classified by salinity as freshwater.
The Company does not discharge hydrocarbon contaminated water into water bodies.
303‑1 The Company’s efforts to identify and prevent negative impacts on water resources are based on measurements and chemical analysis: the Company’s facilities develop, update as necessary, and implement monitoring programs which include wastewater sampling and chemical analysis in accordance with all applicable procedures. Wastewater sample analysis shows that hydrochemical parameters of effluents and pollutant concentrations fall within permissible limits.
Aiming to use water resources sustainably and reduce impacts on water resources as well as to preserve aquatic biological resources and their environments, the Company designs wastewater treatment systems for new facilities, treats all discharged wastewater, monitors effluent quality, and complies with applicable standards.
Water Use and Discharge 303‑1 303‑4 NOVATEK is committed to sustainable water use and efficient wastewater treatment. The Company keeps primary records of consumed and discharged water, with withdrawal and discharge volumes verified by authorized state regulators inspecting compliance with laws and regulations on waterbody protection at intervals depending on risk-based environmental footprint ranking. Additionally, the Company follows environmental monitoring procedures. No conflicts related to water resource use with local community stakeholders were reported in 2020.
Water use 303‑1 NOVATEK does not operate in water-scarce areas. The International Water Management Institute describes Russia as a “sodden” region abundant in water resources. Therefore, the Company runs no risks related to water resources and does not set specific targets to reduce water use; however, reasonable water consumption is part of the Company’s environmental protection policy.

Wastewater discharged into surface water bodies – Ob Bay in the Kara Sea and Luga Bay in the Gulf of Finland – qualifies as treated to standard quality. The Company makes use of mechanical, membrane, and biological treatment technologies, as well as UV disinfection.
Stormwater treatment facility with a capacity of 3,600 cubic meters per day and sewage treatment facility with a capacity of 1,500 cubic meters per day were built and commissioned at the Integrated Facility for Gas Production, Treatment and Liquefaction with LNG and Gas Condensate Offloading of the South-Tambeyskoye gas condensate field. The treatment process employs mechanical, biological, physical, and chemical methods. Treated wastewater is disinfected with ultraviolet 1. In accordance with Federal Law No. 188 “On Subsoil” dated 26 July 2017, only companies with state ownership of more than 50% may be subsoil users on the Russian continental shelf. NOVATEK does not qualify as such company and does not engage in such activities.
irradiation. Chemically and oil contaminated industrial effluents are treated in a dedicated treatment plant with a daily throughput capacity of 2,450 cubic meters to quality standards permitting downhole injection. Before injection, wastewater undergoes separation, two-stage flotation, and post-treatment in a pressure sand filter.
NOVATEK subsidiaries regularly monitor the hydrological and hydrochemical parameters of water bodies in areas where the water bodies are crossed by pipelines.
In 2020, 38 of the Company’s wells (28% of the total) were drilled with hydraulic fracturing. All operations used viscoelastic fluids.
Environmental safety while drilling in shallow waters of Ob Bay1. 
NOVATEK drilled its first well in Ob Bay in 2018. Arctic LNG 3, a subsidiary of NOVATEK, successfully completed the construction of an exploration well with a target depth of 2,800 meters on the North Obskiy license area – the first NOVATEK’s well in Ob Bay (internal waters of Russia). The well was drilled by a jackup rig. The well design and materials were analogous to those used on continental shelf. The well program provided for a logging and testing suite, including cased hole tests. After 86 days, all goals were achieved and the well was plugged and abandoned. The well discovered the North Obskoye field.
Operations in Ob Bay were continued in 2019. Arctic LNG 1 drilled a similar well on the shallow waters of the Geofizicheskoye field.
Wells were drilled and completed with constant focus on environmental safety. Environmental monitoring included three stages (before, during and after drilling) and complied with the engineering and design documentation, which successfully passed state environmental review. Well construction also included water body monitoring under a program approved by the local territorial body of the Federal Water Resources Agency. Monitoring stations were placed in all geographical directions 250 and 500 meters from the jackup rig.
All operations included environmental control: separate waste and wastewater tracking, storage, transportation and processing (all drilling waste, including drilling wastewater, was stored in sealed tanks on the platform or support vessels), with continuous scheduled laboratory control of wastewater (the laboratory was on the shore base). It is worth noting that all water pumps were equipped with fish protection devices approved by the Federal Agency for Fishery. The Company also implemented compensatory measures by releasing muksun and Siberian sturgeon into the West-Siberian Basin rivers.
Environmental safety in deep‑water drilling. 
In 2020, a consortium of NOVATEK, Total (France) and Eni (Italy) drilled the first well on the Lebanese shelf. Total E&P Liban SAL was the project operator. The well depth was 4,190 meters in over 1,500 meters of water. All operations strictly complied with the effective international and local laws as well as international best practices. The consortium conducted field studies, developed and obtained approval for an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), arranged public discussions, and monitored and controlled the operations at all times. All work followed the zero discharge principle. Waste handling and utilization were closely monitored with laboratory control. Acoustic impacts in the supply base located in the port of Beirut were measured on a regular basis. Sea bottom in the well construction area was monitored with an ROV (remotely operated vehicle) throughout the construction period.
As a result, the well construction was successfully completed and required geological information was obtained in full compliance with the EIA, without any threat to the environment in the construction area and onshore facilities supporting the operations.
Biodiversity Conservation and Disturbed Land Remediation. 
Matters of biodiversity conservation and disturbed land remediation are part of NOVATEK’s Health, Safety and Environment Policy and are always included in EIAs prepared for the Group’s projects in accordance with Russian and, for some projects, international requirements. Engineering and design documentation for construction projects provides for the prevention, mitigation and compensation of negative impacts of the planned activities on biodiversity components. Adequacy and effectiveness of these provisions are confirmed by follow-up monitoring in areas potentially affected by the projects.
In 2020, the main content of NOVATEK standard ISU-0-14 Biodiversity Conservation Management was ready, with a multistage internal review procedure completed. The document approval and implementation is scheduled for 2021.
In 2019, under the Ecology national project and the Business and Biodiversity initiative, the Ministry of Natural Resources of Russian Federation issued guidelines for the content of corporate biodiversity conservation programs. Yamal LNG played the most active role in the discussion of this initiative, as its biodiversity conservation program is an important part of sustainable development principles of the project and a strategic, high-level planning document creating a framework for biodiversity conservation management. Pursuant to this program, a Biodiversity Conservation Plan was developed and implemented in accordance with the International Finance Corporation Performance Standard 6 Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources.
304‑1 NOVATEK does not produce or process natural resources in federal-level protected areas and is committed to care for the environment and biodiversity conservation in its operating regions, paying special attention to substantiating the choice of locations for its production sites and contributing to the development of regional infrastructures. NOVATEK has one linear facility (an underground gas pipeline) running through a small part of a regional-level natural landmark. The Company financed the pipeline in partnership with the Administration of the Chelyabinsk Region to expand gas infrastructure to the Dzhabyk village, which was a significant contribution to the development of socially important infrastructure. Running a distribution gas pipeline through a regional-level natural landmark does not violate its protected status, which was confirmed by the positive findings of a state environmental appraisal of the gas pipeline engineering and design documentation and the positive findings of an expert review of the project for forest use in the pipeline buffer 2. Term from IFC Performance Standard 6.
zone issued by the Ministry of the Environment of the Chelyabinsk Region in 2020.
Areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas designated by Russian laws include land and waters identified by international environmental organizations as environmentally and biologically important. Wellknown examples are Ramsar wetlands and important bird areas, which are all outside the areas of direct impact by the Group’s projects. As regards marine environments, pursuant to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, an approach was proposed to identify ecologically and biologically significant marine areas (EBSAs) in the open-ocean waters and deep-sea habitats that may require development of environmental protection strategies by governments and international organizations. Development of this approach resulted in listing some shelf areas, including areas in the Russian Arctic and coastwise the Kamchatka Territory, as EBSA. Parts of these areas are used in the interests of the Company (for navigation and marine transport infrastructure), therefore NOVATEK and its subsidiaries and joint ventures initiated significant expansion of the scope of comprehensive environmental monitoring of the Kara, Barents and Baltic Sea ecosystems.
So far, no critical habitats2 have been identified in zones directly affected by the Group operations. Such studies of marine habitats are scheduled for 2021 and will cover part of Ob Bay and adjacent shallow Ob-Yenisei waters of the Kara Sea. The results of these studies will determine amendments, if any, to previously adopted biodiversity conservation and monitoring programs and plans.
Biodiversity monitoring. 
OG4 In 2020, integrated monitoring of marine ecosystems covered the waters and shores of the Kara Sea (Ob Bay), the Barents Sea (Kola Bay, Kildin Strait) and the Baltic Sea (Luga Bay, Vyborg Bay) in areas potentially affected by the Group operations. Terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems were monitored within license areas and in zones affected by projects in the YamalNenets Autonomous and Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Regions, the Leningrad and Murmansk Regions.
Environmental monitoring by the Group production subsidiaries covered the largest areas, collecting and analyzing information on terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems of license areas. The observations in 2020 showed that the conditions of environmental components in monitoring stations on 38 fields and license areas were satisfactory with a low level of environmental pollution.
The fact that anthropogenic loads are close to background values in the areas of the Company’s responsibility is confirmed by an analysis of hundreds 106 107.

of samples of air, soil, snow cover, surface water, groundwater, and bottom sediments.
In case of unexplored territories, such as the Gydan Peninsula, environmental monitoring of NOVATEK’s license areas provides unique data on the biological diversity of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Specifically, in 2020, the geobotanical studies of Utrenniy license area flora added 16 new species previously not known to be present on this territory. The Company has collected and analyzed information on the ecological succession of species on areas with completed remediation: in particular, plant species diversity and abundance were found to be increasing, with gradual assimilation of the areas by surrounding ecosystems. The studies specifically addressed and found no objective proof of undesirable spread and naturalization of species not native to the Gydan tundra but commonly included in grass seed mixtures used in remediation for fast meadow formation, therefore, areas with remediated vegetation are not sources of bioinvasion.
Good condition of vegetative cover on the Company’s license areas was also confirmed by third-party research. For example, in 2020, the Arctic Research Center published previously collected data of vegetation monitoring on license areas of the SouthTambeyskoye and Yarudeyskoye fields. Vegetation on the plays of both fields does not contain hazardous concentrations of heavy metals and arsenic. The Center plans to use the data to develop regional quality standards for various components of the environment, set maximum allowable concentrations of trace elements and for environmental monitoring1.
Another focus of environmental monitoring during the year was terrestrial vertebrates, including birds as their most diverse group. Avifauna observation using point counts and the line transect method and analysis of archival data resulted in quantitative estimates of bird numbers in the Group operating areas, confirming that their negative impacts on avicenosis was marginal, if any. As measures to prevent direct human impacts (hunting, destroying nests, keeping domestic animals in rotation camps) were successful overall and disturbing factors (light and noise pollution, human presence) and man-made structures, including overhead power transmission lines, are localized, experts consider it possible that some avian species (greater white-fronted goose, long-tailed duck, king eider, to name a few) may “get used” to disturbed habitats and anthropogenic impacts, as birds actively use built-up areas for nesting, feeding, resting, and short-time shelter.
Long-tailed duck (Clangula hyemalis), a species native to the Arctic and Baltic region, with one of the largest but supposedly shrinking population, was previously selected as an indicator species for the avifauna of the SouthTambeyskoye license area (subsoil user: Yamal LNG). The 2020 monitoring, focused on studying wetland habitats 1. Details are available at https://arctic.yanao.ru/presscenter/news/33207/.
of the long-tailed duck, confirmed the bird’s presence and normal numbers for the warm season not only on the Yamal Peninsula but also on the Gydan Peninsula, including areas in the immediate vicinity of process facilities and construction sites.
In 2020, the Arctic Fox project continued scientific observation of arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus): researchers from the Arctic Research Station of the Institute of Plant and Animal Ecology of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Center for Arctic Development with support from Yamal LNG put special electronic collars for satellite monitoring on nine animals near Sabetta and five animals on the Utrenneye oil and gas condensate field. This will help in tracking arctic fox migrations, obtaining more data on their populations and amending recommendations on mitigating the impacts of NOVATEK’s facilities on the arctic fox. Animal movement monitoring is supplementing with body tissue sampling for isotopic analysis to reconstruct the predators’ diet. The research methodology is aligned with the Arctic Council’s CAFF and CBMP program guidelines.
Environmental monitoring also includes detailed studies of the fauna of continental rivers and lakes used for the Company’s projects. A special ichthyological study in 2020 focused on two rivers on the Gydan Peninsula flowing into Ob Bay near the Utrenniy terminal construction site (Arctic LNG 2) which were expected to be the most affected. The study conducted by the Tyumen Branch of the Russian Federal Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography – a leading regional institution in hydrobiology research – showed that water bodies in potentially impacted areas fully retained their properties as fisheries, no indicators of ichthyocenosis transformation relative to background parameters were found, species numbers and ichthyomass remained high, test catches did not show any stress in fish.
Marine studies and monitoring in 2020 covered Luga Bay of the Baltic Sea in the area of potential impact of NOVATEK-Ust-Luga stable gas condensate terminal, Kola Bay of the Barents Sea near the LNG Construction Center of NOVATEK-Murmansk, and the Kildin Strait of the Barents Sea near the LNG Transshipment Complex of NOVATEK – Western Arctic2. Several specialized contractors with adequate equipment and competent personnel were engaged to complete this work. The studies found that most hydrochemical, hydrophysical and hydrobiological parameters of marine ecosystems in areas potentially affected by the Group operations remained at the background levels characteristic of local waters and agree very well with archival and literature data as well as site surveys.
The most extensive integrated multiyear marine study involving NOVATEK is ongoing in Ob Bay of the Kara Sea, as some parts of the study area affected by Yamal LNG (operating LNG and stable gas condensate terminal in Sabetta) and Arctic LNG 2 (Utrenniy terminal and LNG and stable gas condensate on gravity based structures).
In 2020, the Company processed the data of Comprehensive environmental monitoring of Ob Bay area affected by the Yamal LNG project for 2019. The key objective of a comprehensive (integrated between components and linked to the activities in progress) program is to design effective controls for all major environmental risks of Yamal LNG and scientifically prove that its operations do not harm Ob Bay by changing its hydrological conditions, depleting fish stocks or populations of rare and protected species, destroying or degrading unique ecosystems, or impeding natural resource use by local population and indigenous peoples, and fully comply with all Russian and international requirements.
Main results of the Comprehensive Program are expected to be disclosed to stakeholders in 2021: • the first detailed one-time survey of hydrodynamic and hydrochemical conditions of Ob Bay has been completed in the fresh river water and seawater mixing zone of the Kara Sea; • the key findings from a pre-project assessment of the Yamal LNG project risks and impacts on the Ob Bay ecosystems have been confirmed; • the status and productivity of plankton and benthic communities in the project area, as well as the rate of recovery of marine bottom communities at dredging and soil dumping sites have been assessed; • background data have been collected to control the risk of introducing invasive alien species to the Sabetta seaport area due to shipping and ballast water discharge; and • a list of indicator species for Ob Bay has been compiled, as the indicator species for Arctic marine ecosystems proposed at the federal level are not found in estuarine habitats.
2. Arctic Transshipment after 19 March 2021.
The 2020 monitoring, which was a follow-up of the 2019 comprehensive studies of the marine environments of the Ob estuary initiated by Yamal LNG, was arranged by Arctic LNG 2, which engaged Murmansk Marine Biological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, V.I. Il’ichev Pacific Oceanological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Typhoon Research and Production Association under the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring and a number of other research, engineering and testing laboratory centers. The 2020 monitoring boast the largest geographical coverage, time span and work scope: firstly, observation stations and lines spanned the entire Ob Bay from the transit lines of the Bely Island at the north to the village of Seyakha at the south; secondly, field studies were carried out twice during the warm season: in August and September 2020; thirdly, the traditional suite of hydrophysical and hydrochemical studies was supplemented with recording underwater noise generated by both natural features and processes and human activities: navigation and underwater operations.
The work produced a large amount of completely new objective data on the natural communities of Ob Bay and impact from marine transport and underwater operations (dredging, dumping, making foundations) thereon. The interpretation of these unique materials is now ongoing, using all available data, thermohaline structure models of waters and hydrodynamic processes and leveraging advanced remote observations – ultrahigh resolution space imaging in various spectral ranges.
It was the first ever study with such level of detail of the behavior of suspended substances and planktonic organisms in the water of Ob Bay, interaction between seawater and river water in the Ob estuary (manifested in resulting hydrophysical and hydrochemical parameters of the waterbody), which recorded sonographs of marine mammals and tankers and determined boundaries of navigation and underwater operation impacts on marine biota (it was proven beyond doubt that these impact do not reach outside the predicted impact zones). Also, the rate and direction of shoreline movement near the Utrenniy terminal was determined and lithodynamic monitoring grid was placed at the area of contact between sea and land.
It was established that, as in 2017–2019, the marine ecosystems of Ob Bay are in a good condition overall, and habitats are not disturbed outside the areas directly used for underwater operations: dredging, dumping, and construction of various structures.
Final monitoring reports are submitted every year in due time to authorized territorial governmental authorities (for the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region, in particular, the Department for Nature and Resource Regulation, Forestry Relations and Oil and Gas Industry Development).

Environmental damage compensation 304‑3 The Company is fully aware of the consequences of its operations and acts to compensate any damage and restore the environment. In 2020, NOVATEK subsidiaries and joint ventures worked in several directions.
Compensatory fish stocking. 
In 2020, the young of valuable fish species were released into the rivers of the West-Siberian (within the KhantyMansiysk and Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Regions) and Northern (the Murmansk Region) Fishing Basins. A total of more than 3 mln juvenile fish were released1: RedBook Siberian Sturgeon (Acipenser baerii, about 571,000); muksun, a Coregonus species with shrinking population whose fishing in the West Siberian Fishing Basin is prohibited (Coregonus muksun, about 1.22 mln); as well as Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar, about 21,000); broad whitefish (Coregonus nasus, about 1.25 mln); and peled (Coregonus peled, about 3,000). Large numbers of fish pre-approved by the Federal Agency for Fishery are released every year into water bodies of importance for the fishing industry for artificial reproduction of aquatic biological resources. The young of the above aquatic biological resources are raised by several hatcheries: Murmansk branch of Chief Basin Administration for Fishing and Aquatic Biological Resources Conservation, Tyumen branch of the Russian Federal Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography, Yugorsk Fish Hatchery, and Sobskiy Fish Hatchery. Due to the protected status of the West Siberian subspecies Acipenser baerii, the young of sturgeon are released in accordance with permits issued by the Federal Service for Supervision of Natural Resources.
Compensatory reforestation of burnt areas and felling sites not resulting from the Company’s activities. 
Compensatory reforestation sites (mostly thin forests and burnt areas) were selected by local forestry authorities, 1. The calculation is based on 100% Company’s share in joint ventures. 2. Arctic Transshipment after 19 March 2021. 3. The list is open as the Group continually expands the geography of its operations and the status of some species changes from time to time.
with reforestation projects agreed with the Department for Nature and Resource Regulation and Forestry Relations of the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region. Seeds and planting stock were obtained from the plant nurseries of the KhantyMansiysk Autonomous Region and the Sverdlovsk Region. In 2020, reforestation in the Tarko-Sale forestry area covered about 120 ha, with a much larger scope planned for 2021.
Land remediation 304‑2 In 2020, a total of 317 ha of land was returned to landowners within the Company’s license areas, including 116 ha of unused forest land and 201 ha of remediated land.
During the reporting period, land remediation mostly focused on areas disturbed by construction and followed previously approved engineering and design solutions. The bulk of land (about 117 ha in total) was restored for forests, and about 84 ha were restored for agricultural use.
Conservation of gene pools of ecosystems. 
For the purpose of preserving the genotypes of rare and endangered plant species listed in the Red Data Books of the Russian Federation and the Murmansk Region, all Rhodiola rosea and Alchemilla alpina were manually transplanted from the LNG transshipment terminal construction site on the shore of Ura Bay of the Barents Sea to a greenhouse in the botanical garden of Avrorin Polar Alpine Botanical Garden and Institute (PABGI) under the Kola Science Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The work was completed by PABGI specialists under Permit of the Federal Service for Supervision of Natural Resources No. 113 dated 15 October 2020, and witnessed by representatives of the Baltic-Arctic Interregional Administration of the Federal Service for Supervision of Natural Resources and NOVATEK – Western Arctic2. Transplanted plants augmented the PABGI’s nursery collections and will be cultivated to reproduce both rare species.
304‑4 Animal species included in the IUCN Red List with habitats affected by the Company operations: 1. Critically endangered (CR): 0; 2. Endangered (EN): 1 (Siberian sturgeon); 3. Vulnerable (VU): 6 (polar bear, long-tailed duck, Steller’s eider, snowy owl, black-legged kittiwake, velvet scoter); 4.

The Company’s 2020 Achievements in Environmental Protection4 4. Details on achievements in fighting climate change are available in the Climate Change section, pp. 83. 5. Details on the targets are available on NOVATEK’s official web-site at https://www.novatek.ru/en/development/targets/. 6. Novatek Polska prior to 3 February 2020. 7. The term “carbon-neutral” means that Novatek Green Energy compensated for the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from the following scopes: upstream transport of LNG from the supply source at LNG terminals in Europe to the fueling station, fueling station operations and the final consumption of LNG by end-customers. 8. The calculation is based on 100% Company’s share in joint ventures.
NOVATEK’s Environmental and Climate Change targets5. 
In August 2020, the NOVATEK Board of Directors approved the Company’s Environmental and Climate Change targets for the period up to 2030, including the reduction of emissions per unit of production, in particular methane emissions in the upstream, processing and LNG segments as well as greenhouse gas emissions reduction in upstream and LNG. Moreover, the Company intends to improve its APG utilization rate as well as waste disposal and utilization.
102‑12 Joining the Methane Guiding Principles initiative. 
In 2020, NOVATEK joined the Methane Guiding Principles, one of the most important global oil and gas initiatives towards climate neutrality and low-carbon economy. A package of practices and procedures to record, monitor and reduce methane emissions from hydrocarbon production, processing, transportation and storage will be implemented under this initiative. Corporate reporting documentation will also be prepared and disclosed under the initiative.
Reduction of GHG emissions by APG injection. 
Deep reinjection of APG to enhance oil recovery from the Yarudeyskoye field cut our GHG emissions by 1.2 mmt of CO2 equivalent – a major environmental benefit achieved through reinjection of over 357 mmcm in 2020.
Company contribution to the Ecology national project. 
The start-up of a small-scale LNG plant in Magnitogorsk, Chelyabinsk Region, in 2020 was one of the highlights for the Russian fuel market and marked another milestone in replacing diesel fuel with more environmentally friendly and economical NGV fuel. The two largest cities of the Southern Ural, Chelyabinsk and Magnitogorsk, participate in the Clean Air project, which is part of the Ecology national project. The new LNG project will help them achieve targets for reducing road transport emissions.
Progress in fueling station network development in Europe. 
In December 2020, Novatek Green Energy6 opened its first carbon-neutral7 LNG fueling station in Rostock, Germany. The carbon footprint of the LNG sold to consumers, including its final consumption, is compensated through carbon offsetting. A carefully selected portfolio of emission compensation projects includes wind generation projects in developing countries. The emission compensation projects were certified in accordance with the international VCS standard (Verified Carbon Standard).
As part of NOVATEK’s long-term strategy, the Company plans to build a network of fueling stations in Europe to provide freight transport with clean fuel at key transport connecting points between Germany and Poland. At the end of January 2021, the Company owned a network of 9 LNG fueling stations as well as 21 regasification units on the European market.
Compensatory fish stocking. 
In 2020, artificial reproduction of aquatic biological resources by releasing fish into important fishing water bodies focused on the West-Siberian (within the KhantyMansiysk and Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Regions) and Northern (the Murmansk Region) Fishing Basins. Several subsidiaries were involved in releasing the juvenile fish of Siberian sturgeon, salmon and whitefishes (including muksun) into the water bodies to re-stock these commercially important fish. A total of more than 3 mln juvenile fish were released8.
Reforestation 2020 saw the first reforestation by the Company on land plots selected for compensatory reforestation (mostly thin forests and burnt areas). Seeds and planting stock were obtained from the plant nurseries of the KhantyMansiysk Autonomous Region and the Sverdlovsk Region. In 2020, reforestation in the Tarko-Sale forestry area covered about 120 ha.

Procurement and Supply Chain Management 102‑9 Procurement, an essential pillar of NOVATEK’s supply chain, keeps our operations running with zero downtime. We annually procure a significant amount of goods and services and engage many contractors.
NOVATEK’s procurement activities comply with Russian laws and the Company’s local regulations, in particular, with the Regulations on Organizing and Holding of Competitive Tenders at NOVATEK, our core procurement document. Our uniform procurement policies and principles are shared throughout NOVATEK, its subsidiaries and joint ventures.
NOVATEK’s procurement centers around the following principles: • equal treatment, non-discrimination, and respect for fair competition among tenderers; • transparency and integrity of procurement-related information; • compliance with NOVATEK’s business ethics and anticorruption requirements; • cost-effective procurement of goods and services for the purposes intended and in strict compliance with the requirements for quality and lead time; and • long-term cooperation with key partners.
Our supply chain management system is an integrated process covering procurement planning, inventory management, pre-qualification of tenderers, evaluation of tenders and contract award, contract quality and milestone management (including expediting, duringproduction inspections, delivery receipt, checking the necessary permits, and incoming inspection), and control of inventory transactions.
The supply chain management is also closely linked with other related processes at the Company, such as contract management and budgeting.
Procurement procedure. 
NOVATEK’s procurement process gives subsidiaries and joint ventures the authority to purchase the bulk of goods and services at their own discretion with overall oversight from NOVATEK’s headquarters, reserving centralized procurement for highly critical and expensive items to save through bulk buying.
The procured items include piping, Christmas trees, valves, rotating (compressors, gas compressor units, pumps, motors and engines) and static (heat exchangers, tanks) equipment, instrumentation and control systems, structural metallic products, various materials, to name a few.
NOVATEK favors open competitive tendering where any tenderer may bid for the goods or services pursuant to the terms and procedure set by the Company.
We post tenders through an e-marketplace to ensure transparency and offer equal opportunities to tenderers. The details for some tenders are also posted on NOVATEK’s website, or a website of our subsidiary/joint venture.
For tenders invited through an e-marketplace, all relevant details are provided to tenderers through an e-marketplace operator in line with its policy. If there are changes to the tender conditions, notice is given to all tenderers at the same time to ensure they all have an equal opportunity to revise their tenders.
Tenders are evaluated by a cross-functional team of experts who do not influence each other’s opinion.
All tenderers are granted equal access to the relevant data about the tender conditions, procedures, and closing date.
Requirements for suppliers. 
Our requirements for potential suppliers and items to be procured ensure unbiased evaluation of all tenderers and tenders and minimize the risk of non-performance (improper performance) of the contract.
We favor original equipment manufacturers or companies holding a valid dealership certificate over unauthorized dealers.
NOVATEK uses the following criteria to evaluate tenders and award the contract: • cost and quality of the goods and services; compliance of the goods with technical requirements, and the total cost of ownership of the goods tendered; • delivery time for the goods and services; • availability of tangible fixed assets, required equipment, along with engineering and blue-collar staff; • track record in similar projects supported by references and specifically with NOVATEK affiliated companies and other industry leaders; and • solvency and business reputation.
Contracting at NOVATEK, including through collegial bodies, is subject to the relevant regulations to make sure every effort is made to have tenders and tenderers dealt with according to a transparent, fair, and impartial procedure.
To ensure a supplier performs its contract obligations properly and in a timely manner, NOVATEK conducts a thorough pre-qualification of tenderers in terms of solvency, track record and expertise, reputation, required production capacities and human resources, as well as quality systems in place.
NOVATEK uses internal controls, such as segregation of duties and a cross-checking system, to avoid unfair practices in the procurement process.
On top of that, NOVATEK applies zero-tolerance approach to illegal activities of potential counterparties (for example, corruption, collusion, unfair competition) and avoids unreliable contractors. Driven by high ethical standards and principles related to transparent and fair business practices, as well as our commitment to building a sustainable supply chain, in September 2020, NOVATEK adopted the Supplier Code of Conduct that defines our expectations and recommendations for suppliers in terms of compliance with human rights, business ethics (including the principles of the United Nations Global Compact, International Labor Organization, ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and applicable environmental and industrial safety legislation), HSE principles, and workers’ rights (including avoidance of child and forced labor).
The Supplier Code of Conduct can be found on our official website.
Before signing a contract, we inform our counterparties about this Code and its compliance-related expectations.
NOVATEK’s experts conduct on-site audits to verify the compliance of a tenderer’s occupational health and safety (OHS) management systems with international standards, Russian laws, and NOVATEK’s internal regulations. If there are any issues found by our audits, a tenderer is to fix these issues and provide NOVATEK with evidence. Failure to do so will result in a tender being rejected from the NOVATEK’s procurement process.
Our contracts also include the OHS requirements for any supplier to comply with.
Supplier relations. 
NOVATEK is committed to building strategic, long-term and mutually beneficial relations with its counterparties through unbiased and fair practices that seek to benefit all parties involved.
Building a pool of key suppliers is high on the agenda in our Company. NOVATEK’s key suppliers are: • manufacturers of materials and equipment strategically important to the Company’s operations and investment programs, including in terms of supply volumes and items criticality; and • suppliers appointed by the licensors of technologies used at the Group’s facilities.
The Company seeks to expand its pool of counterparties through regular market research to attract new manufacturers and maintain the necessary level of competition.
NOVATEK’s supplier portfolio is continuously expanded through evaluation of tenderers in terms of having production capabilities to meet our product specifications. If any issues are brought out by the evaluation, potential suppliers are given feedback to improve their production processes.
Our regular open forums for suppliers and contractors keep the market up-to-date on our capital construction plans, outline the key requirements for potential contractors, and attract qualified, well-equipped and experienced counterparties to NOVATEK’s projects.
To keep our employees and suppliers healthy and safe amid surging COVID-19, in 2020, NOVATEK used virtual communications to discuss priority issues with suppliers instead of face-to-face meetings.

NOVATEK’s procurement breakdown in 2020. 
Import Substitution. 
NOVATEK seeks to support local producers through favoring products and services of Russian origin if they meet technical requirements and are competitively priced vs. imported counterparts. Therefore, we are pursuing a policy of import substitution of foreign technologies and equipment through: • investments in setting up our own LNG production technologies and capacities to manufacture liquefaction trains; • proactive work with federal executive authorities and contribution to the efforts of cross-functional working groups to localize the production of technologies and equipment in Russia, including through the government support mechanisms; and • systematic work with local and foreign manufacturers to foster technology transfer and drive the local production of equipment and materials for LNG projects.
A significant amount of local content was used by NOVATEK for our NOVATEK-Murmansk’s LNG Construction Center and the ongoing LNG projects Arctic LNG 2 and Yamal LNG Train 4, as showcased below: • about 400 suppliers; • about 50,000 people of manufacturers’ personnel; and • orders for the main types of materials and equipment totaling: – about 1,800 items of equipment; – pipe weighing over 300,000 tons; – structural metallic products weighing over 200,000 tons; and – reinforcing bars weighing over 200,000 tons.
The first domestic large-capacity cryogenic pump was successfully tested at the Yamal LNG project in December 2020. This pump was designed and manufactured by Afrikantov OKB Mechanical Engineering (an Atomenergomash affiliated company). The pilot testing took place at the Yamal LNG’s operating tank farm, with the plant running at its design capacity.
A St. Petersburg-based joint venture, set up by Linde AG (Germany) and Severstal, localized the production of coilwound heat exchangers for large-scale LNG projects. The heat exchanger for the third train of Arctic LNG 2 is currently being manufactured.

The Company also repaired the Murmansk regional hospital and supplied it with more than 100 additional hospital beds.
Yamal‑Nenets Autonomous Region development. 
The Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region is the core region for the Company’s operations, which is why most of our efforts are concentrated in this region. NOVATEK strives to be actively involved in addressing the problems of local communities in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region.
203‑1 In 2020, the Company supported the following infrastructure initiatives across the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region: • repairs and improvements to social infrastructure facilities, sports institutions, and pre-school educational institutions; • repair of the sewage pumping station facilities in Tarko-Sale; • construction of modern children’s playgrounds; • purchase of waste incinerators, solar panels and mobile solar power plants; and • adaptation of residential space and public property in apartment blocks to meet the needs of people with reduced mobility in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region.
To improve social conditions of local communities, the Company provided assistance to low-income families, people with disabilities, the elderly, veterans, severely ill children and children with special needs, as well as people in financial distress.
203‑2 Since 2020, together with the Government of the YamalNenets Autonomous Region, NOVATEK has been supporting “Teacher for Russia”, a unique program to bring graduates of Russia’s leading universities to small regional schools and provide teacher training for young talent. The program promotes equal educational opportunities for children in different regions of Russia. Seven participants of the Teacher for Russia program moved to the YamalNenets Autonomous Region to teach in local schools for the next two years.
The Company provides funds to help the indigenous peoples of the Far North to enroll in training programs matched to the employment needs of energy companies and the Yamal District community, as well as supports young talent among the local indigenous peoples of the Far North.
Support of the indigenous peoples of the Far North 203‑1 203‑2 OG9 The Company’s projects, including the Yamal LNG project, affect the interests of indigenous peoples of the Far North. NOVATEK carefully analyzes the project’s potential negative impact and makes every effort to minimize it. At the same time, the Company makes a significant contribution to sustaining the livelihoods of indigenous peoples of the Far North and maintaining their traditional ways of life and cultural traditions.
Yamal LNG has developed and successfully implements a number of policies and regulations to promote the sustainable development of indigenous peoples of the Far North and safeguard their rights to maintain their traditional ways of life, protect ancestral lands and preserve cultural traditions: • Corporate social responsibility policy; • HSE policy; • Human rights policy; • Business ethics policy; • Stakeholder engagement plan; • Regulations on the Advisory Board; • Indigenous peoples of the Far North engagement guide; • Plan to promote the sustainable development of indigenous peoples; • Regulations on hiring members of indigenous peoples of the Far North by Yamal LNG and contractors; • Stakeholder query handling procedure; and • Shift camp management policy and plan.

At the same time, NOVATEK personnel’s minimum wage in its regions of operation is traditionally higher than the local minimum wage, which is stipulated in the collective bargaining agreement.

It is important for NOVATEK to be an attractive employer, so its personnel policy is based on the Company’s commitment to healthy and safe working conditions; decent and competitive salaries and other financial incentives; and the best opportunities for employee development, self-fulfillment and career growth.
The Company has zero tolerance to any form of discrimination, including employee discrimination: in recruitment, providing career opportunities, social benefits, and in any other aspects. Wage rates for women and men are based on equal pay structures at NOVATEK for the specific type of work performed.
Although the majority of the Company’s employees are male (77%), which is dictated by the nature of the Company’s operations, i.e. Far Northern geography and rotation job arrangements, female employees have equal opportunities for development and promotion. In 2020, a woman was elected to NOVATEK’s Board of Directors for the first time, which was an important step towards gender balance on the Board.
The Company is interested in long-term employment and is willing to make all the related commitments: 90% of the staff are hired under permanent employment contracts, including 99% on a full-time basis. The share of parttimers is marginal to the Company (below 0.5%) and is not included in this Report. NOVATEK sources minimal services from freelancers or sole proprietors.

403‑3 Key roles of NOVATEK’s Occupational Health and Safety unit: • monitor the OHS management system’s compliance with ISO 45001 across NOVATEK and ensure its effectiveness; • provide organizational and methodological support to the Company’s industrial safety activities; • implement an effective system of responding to and preventing injuries and accidents at the Company’s facilities; and • engage with federal and local authorities, nongovernmental and non-profit organizations to discuss industrial safety issues.
The Company’s Occupational Health and Safety goals: minimize risks and prevent threats of industrial accidents and injuries to the workforce wherever achievable, given the Company’s current capabilities and resources; comply with Russian OHS laws and aim to meet relevant international standards and best practices; continuously improve the OHS management system based on control and monitoring results, as well as routine audits and regular reviews of the system’s effectiveness; create comfortable working conditions for employees to reduce the occupational disease rate and the number of workdays lost; and ensure that governance bodies, employees, and emergency rescue teams are prepared to contain and respond to potential industrial accidents, fires and emergencies.
• provide employees with personal and collective protective equipment, wash-off and decontaminating agents; and • ensure the safe performance of contract work and the procurement of safe products.
403‑7 Company employees on secondments are also required to strictly follow OHS standards in line with Articles 166–169 of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation. Upon arrival to their destination, seconded employees receive an OHS induction briefing and are informed of the safety rules specific to their site, as well as provided with protective clothing, footwear and other personal protective equipment. Employees are not allowed to work at a facility without completing relevant occupational health training.
NOVATEK also keeps records of injuries among its contractors2. OHS requirements form an integral part of agreements between subsidiaries and contractors. The agreements provide for penalties in case of breach of OHS rules by contractors. In 2020, the Company implemented the Supplier Code of Conduct, which defines its expectations of suppliers’ OHS practices.
403‑4 OHS issues are monitored by NOVATEK’s senior management, and the Company’s OHS performance is reviewed by its Board of Directors3. The Remuneration and Nomination Committee of the Board of Directors annually reviews the Sustainability Report, which gives a clear picture of the Company’s OHS approaches and performance. In addition, NOVATEK’s top management holds regular conference calls on OHS issues with the CEOs of subsidiaries and joint ventures.
Management of subsidiaries and joint ventures also pay particular attention to OHS compliance at their production sites. Employees, including blue-collar workers, are involved in the OHS risk assessment process and in discussing issues. Moreover, the employees involved in production processes on a daily basis or periodically (as prescribed by local regulations) monitor their working conditions including inspection of their workplaces, tools, accessories, protective clothing, and collective protective equipment. If any non-compliance or hazard is identified, the employees notify their supervisor, and measures are taken to remedy the breach and provide safer working conditions.
The Company participates in OHS-promoting initiatives and works on an ongoing basis to raise employee awareness of OHS.
Working conditions and OHS issues are included in collective bargaining agreements, which regulate labor relations with assistance from trade union committees.
In 2020, spending on OHS, fire safety and security at the Group facilities totaled RR 2,436 mln.

Operational Control. 
OG13 403‑8 403‑9 In line with the applicable industrial safety legislation, the Company carries out operational control at hazardous production facilities (HPFs), with each enterprise approving its operational control commission by its order.
Key operational control objectives at the HPF: • ensure industrial safety compliance at the HPF; • review the current status of industrial safety, including by organizing necessary expert reviews; • design initiatives to improve industrial safety and prevent environmental damage; • follow up compliance with industrial safety requirements set out in federal laws and other regulations; • coordinate efforts aimed at preventing accidents at the HPF and ensuring preparedness to contain and respond to accidents; • follow up compliance with certification and test schedules for various types of equipment used at the HPF, as well as schedules for repairing and calibrating instrumentation and controls; and • follow up compliance with process specifications.
Operational control at HPFs is part of the industrial safety management system and is carried out through a range of measures aimed at ensuring safe operation of HPFs, as well as prevention of accidents at these facilities and preparedness to contain and respond to accidents.
The Company carries out two types of operational control: compliance with industrial safety requirements at HPFs and compliance with sanitary and epidemiological requirements.
Annually, the Company develops plans for comprehensive and targeted inspections; based on the results of these inspections, reports are drawn and corrective actions are developed to timely eliminate any identified gaps. Within the established timeframe, employees in charge submit corrective action reports to the OHS unit for further analysis of the risk of possible hazardous situations.
403‑9 In 2020, subsidiary and joint venture commissions conducted a total of 409 audits for compliance with industrial safety requirements, including integrated and targeted audits.
Operational control over the compliance with sanitary rules and the implementation of sanitary epidemic control (preventive) enable timely identification of breaches and immediate responses to them, which can prevent 403‑1 403‑8 The occupational health management system operates as part of the integrated OHS management system. The main objective of deploying the occupational health management system at an enterprise is to move from reactive incident responses to proactive management of health risks to employees.
The key focus areas of the Company’s occupational health management system: • train employees in occupational health (briefings, training); • organize and conduct special assessments of working conditions; • manage occupational risks; • organize and conduct employee health monitoring; • inform employees about working conditions at their workplaces and occupational risk levels, as well as about the guarantees and compensations they are entitled to; • ensure optimal work and rest patterns for employees; 136 137.

injuries, occupational and infectious diseases or other consequences of negative impact on employee health.
Operational control covers buildings, structures, process equipment, production processes, vehicles and workplaces. In addition to occupational hazards, raw materials for the production of food products, semifinished products, finished food products, and potable water are also subject to operational control through laboratory testing.
Medical activities to prevent infectious diseases (including hospital-acquired infections) are supported by operational control of the compliance with sanitary epidemic control requirements and disinfection and sterilization protocols at first-aid posts and observation and isolation facilities performing mandatory laboratory tests (disinfectant activity, surface-treatment quality, tests of medical instruments and medical equipment).
If medical activities are outsourced to a contractor, the contractor has to monitor the compliance with these requirements independently.
To safeguard employees’ right to safe working conditions, the Company carries out special assessments of working conditions. In 2020, 9,254 workplaces were certified, with no workplaces with hazardous working conditions identified. However, workplace hazards still exist at our production facilities, including exposure to the following factors with marginal health impact: microclimate, static electricity, electromagnetic radiation, noise at workplace, chemicals, physical exertion and eye strain.
Occupational Health 403‑6 The Company is strongly focused on the promotion of worker health and provision of timely medical care. Firstaid posts have been set up at the Company’s remote facilities. In 2020, the Group operated 28 first-aid posts with 24-hour availability. To ensure timely provision of medical care, 51 first-aid posts have been set up at contractors’ facilities. In the reporting year, the number of medical staff providing medical services to employees working on a rotational basis rose from 58 to 122. Including the contractors’ first-aid posts, the medical personnel totaled 192.
To provide medical assistance to employees, the firstaid posts are supplied with advanced equipment. Some remote first-aid posts are provided with ambulances (a total of 12 ambulances including contractors’ vehicles). The first-aid posts at the most remote sites are equipped with in-patient facilities and intensive-care units. Operators of remote fields use air ambulances to provide emergency assistance and airlift injured personnel.
In the event of an accident or acute illness (such as an infectious disease or intoxication) reported at a facility, measures are taken to minimize the severity of the accident or acute illness consequences and prevent a fatality.
Emergency medical response plans are worked out for remote facilities of subsidiaries, joint ventures and contractors to ensure emergency preparedness and timely medical aid. These plans include first aid and follow-up care, timely evacuation, and regular drills to practice firstaid skills. The requirement for contractors to have such plans (even if they do not have their own first-aid posts) is included as a special clause in relevant contracts.
To secure the sanitary and epidemiological welfare at the facilities of NOVATEK subsidiaries and joint ventures, the Company monitors water supply and disposal, sanitary and hygienic condition of accommodation, industrial premises and public catering facilities, and waste disposal. In the reporting year, there were no cases of infectious diseases among employees related to catering services or water supply.
In 2020, scheduled employee health activities were also continued, with preventive medical examinations carried out to determine employees’ professional fitness to work and case monitoring. During the reporting year, 11,016 employees underwent medical examinations and 4,095 persons took psychiatric examination.
The Company provides its workforce with access to flu vaccination: in the reporting year, 15,376 people were vaccinated, including 2,612 NOVATEK’s employees and 12,764 contractor and subcontractor employees.
Occupational health during the COVID‑19 pandemic 403‑6 In February 2020, an “Action Plan to Safeguard against the Coronavirus at NOVATEK and its Controlled Entities” was put in place to protect employees and prevent transmission and spread of the novel coronavirus at the Company’s facilities.
For prompt response and coordination, the Company established emergency operations centers (Novy Urengoy, Tarko-Sale, the Leningrad Region and Murmansk, and the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region LNG Projects) and arranged cooperation with the emergency operations centers of the executive authorities of the Russian regions and local authorities.
The COVID-19 control measures were implemented in strict compliance with the Russian Government Resolution No. 601 “On Approval of Temporary Regulations for RotationBased Work”, dated 28 April 2020, directives by Russia’s Chief Public Health Officer, as well as resolutions by the heads of the Russian Federation constituent entities.
Professionally organized efforts within NOVATEK as well as effective cooperation with authorities, medical companies, and suppliers of medical goods made it possible to respond promptly to disruptions caused by the pandemic.
The following actions were taken during 2020: • shift duration was extended; • procedures for pre-shift observation were developed for new rotation personnel arriving to production sites as were logistics arrangements to transport the personnel, which enabled mitigating the risks of the coronavirus spreading into sites of operations; • for rotation personnel, temporary accommodation along with medical observation and COVID-19 testing was arranged; • systematic campaigns were organized to raise employee awareness of prevention of acute respiratory viral infections, including COVID-19, alongside briefings to educate workers about the specifics of the novel coronavirus infection; • most of the employees not involved in continuousoperation HPFs were shifted to remote work (from March to August 2020); • special protocols were put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 following the return from remote working: temperature screening at workplaces, social distancing, use of personal protective equipment and sanitizer, strict restrictions on in-person gatherings, to name a few; • restrictions were imposed on employee business trips; • procedure for shifting employees to remote working was established, along with the introduction of mostly digital interaction protocols and IT measures to support remote working; • COVID-19 testing of employees was arranged; • data on the COVID-19 situation at facilities was collected and analyzed; • the Group employees were provided with the necessary personal protective equipment as well as means and devices for room disinfection, hand sanitizing, and noncontact thermometers to measure body temperature; • additional contracts were signed with medical service providers to put in place prevention and epidemiccontrol measures; • a stock of medicines was built up at facilities to treat employees against acute respiratory diseases, including COVID-19; • observation and isolation facilities were deployed and equipped, medical equipment (a CT scanner, electrocardiographs, body fluid analyzers, tonometers, pulse oximeters, glucose meters, thermometers) was purchased; 1. This option remained available in 2021.
• a number of medical staff was increased at medical units, including various specialists – pulmonologists, cardiologists and infectious disease specialists; and • Company’s employees returning from remote working or from vacation are required to take COVID-19 tests, and only those testing negative are admitted to work.
After all restrictions were lifted, the Company, among other things, provided an opportunity to work remotely to certain employee categories – people over 65, pregnant women and employees at risk of developing severe complications from an infection due to underlying medical conditions1.
The concerted actions of the Company, its employees, partners and authorities allowed us to provide our people with strong protection and maintain NOVATEK’s operational momentum amid the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
Fire Safety, Civil Defense and Emergencies. 
Since the Company’s business directly involves operation of facilities exposed to fire and explosion risks, fire safety is a top priority for NOVATEK. The Company has in place a fire safety system compliant with the Russian law. The system’s objective is to prevent fires and protect people and property in case of a fire or an emergency.
The Company’s approach to fire safety, civil defense and emergency situations and respective activities are fully aligned with applicable laws and technical regulations. For innovative and complex projects, compliance with safety requirements under the design documentation and specifications is ensured individually for each facility.
In 2020, eight subsidiaries had licenses to service firefighting equipment, five subsidiaries – to perform firefighting as well as emergency response and rescue operations. A large share of licensed fire safety services is outsourced. Subsidiaries operating hazardous facilities that produce, collect, process, and manufacture explosives and flammable substances are protected by 27 professional emergency response and rescue teams. To ensure safety, the Company has over 1,000 permanent employees in professional emergency response and rescue teams and over 200 units of basic and special emergency response and rescue equipment for various purposes. In addition, we have decided to build fire stations and establish emergency response and rescue teams within prospective field development and construction projects.
In 2020, the total headcount of fire and emergency teams serving the facilities on a 24-hour basis stood at 835 certified rescue workers. 38 engineers directly monitored and supervised the fire safety and emergency response environment at the Company’s facilities. Materials and equipment available to the emergency 138 139. 
Sustainability Report 2020 THINK GREEN. THINK NATURAL GAS.


response and rescue teams comply with all existing requirements. The Company ensures timely renewal of both basic and specialized fire vehicle fleets.
Inspections are regularly carried out at subsidiary facilities to assess the emergency preparedness and response capabilities of the Company’s business units and personnel, and evaluate the resources of in-house and external professional emergency response and rescue teams. In 2020, there were 24,243 patrols of facility areas in order to continuously monitor safe operation conditions, and 733 checks of outdoor fire water supply sources were carried out. Professional emergency response and rescue teams performed 18,053 control patrols for safe hot work, fire- and gas-hazardous operations. The subsidiary facilities implement a full-scale program to respond to oil, petroleum product, and other hydrocarbon spills.
OG13 Fire safety, civil defense and emergency response training, as well as fire and emergency drills, are an important element of the overall system of fire safety and preparedness to respond to fires and emergencies. In 2020, the Company held 25,973 fire safety briefings that featured guidance materials and visual aids, as well as hands-on presentations. Basic fire safety training was provided to 8,735 people, with 2,416 tactical fire exercises performed as part of emergency spill response plans, accident containment and response plans, as well as evacuation drills. The emergency response and rescue teams are made up of 490 certified rescue workers. The number of certified rescue workers decreased year-on-year by 130 due to changes in legislation and non-professional emergency response team members being excluded from the total number.
In 2020, the Group registered one fire at a non-production facility. The combustion area was 15 square meters, no one was injured.
NOVATEK fully complies with fire safety, civil defense, and emergency response regulations: all facilities are equipped with automatic fire detection, alarm and extinguishing systems.
Work‑Related Injuries 403‑2 403‑3 403‑8 403‑9 NOVATEK makes every effort to reduce injuries and prevent accidents; all incidents are thoroughly investigated afterwards.
NOVATEK identifies hazards and assesses injury risks to meet the requirements of ISO 45001 and applicable Russian laws. We promote risk awareness among our employees and design risk management initiatives, including for risk prevention and mitigation.
In line with the Russian Labor Code, our employees have the right to abstain from performing their duties if their performance involves risks of injury or deterioration of health.
1. Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate is calculated as number of lost time injuries × 1 mln person-hours/total hours worked.
All work-related incidents (injuries or deterioration of health) are timely recorded in line with the Company’s internal procedures. Occupational health laws and guidelines applicable at NOVATEK subsidiaries and joint ventures provide that every employee must report all situations that threaten lives and health, including those that may result in deterioration of health, to their supervisor or employer.
Properly and timely investigating each incident in production, the Company can identify the causes of injuries and take corrective measures to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, as well as decide on the liability of responsible employees and on compensation for damages.
Accidents in production are investigated and registered in line with Articles 227–231 of the Russian Labor Code and Provision No. 73 “On the Peculiarities of the Investigation of Occupational Accidents in Certain Industries and Organizations”, dated 24 October 2002 and approved by Decree of the Russian Ministry of Labor and Social Protection. Hazard identification and risk assessment include analysis of information about incidents submitted in line with the Company’s standard ISU-0-08 Integrated HSE Management System Standard “Procedure for Reporting of Information About Incidents by Controlled Entities”.
In line with Federal Law No. 426-FZ “On Special Assessment of Working Conditions”, dated 28 December 2013, each workplace accident resulting in exposure is followed by an unscheduled special assessment of working conditions within six months, and the Company must inform the organization that conducts the special assessment of working conditions of employees’ proposals on identification of potentially harmful and/or hazardous production factors in their workplaces (if there are any).
In addition to statutory requirements, the Company applies its Incident Root Cause Analysis Standard for internal investigation of incidents. The main purpose of an internal investigation is to enable a comprehensive review of the events preceding an incident and the implementation of corrective actions to prevent future incidents.
403‑9 In 2020, the Group recorded 13 work-related injuries – 11 minor injuries and 2 high-consequence injury. 8 out of 13 injuries were related to employee movement and climate conditions (slipping and falling), and the rest to driving vehicles and performing operations. In 2020, the LTIFR1 among the Group’s employees registered at 0.49, representing a 29% decline compared to 2019 (0.69). There were no fatalities within the Company in 2020. The Company also keeps records of injuries among contractors. In 2020, 177 accidents involving contractor employees were recorded, including 4 fatalities accidents, with a total of 7 fatalities.
403‑2 All accidents were investigated in accordance with the applicable laws and local regulations. A dedicated commission comprised of the Company’s health and safety officers, trade union representatives, injured persons’ attorneys, and other subsidiary employees investigated every accident. The commissions identified both the immediate and underlying causes of the incidents and developed respective preventive measures to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. The employees at fault were held liable and accountable for their actions.
OHS units of the Company’s subsidiaries track contractors’ workplace injury statistics.
NOVATEK has in place procedures to collect information on work-related injuries. All information on injuries, including those which occurred to contractor employees, is analyzed in detail. A summary overview of the injuries is distributed to all subsidiaries and contractors to take preventive measures. The results of actions taken are reported to NOVATEK and are also reviewed and later used in the annual review of injury rates. Accident records are submitted to the government statistical services annually.
Accidents and Incidents. 
NOVATEK records and analyzes not only accidents in production, but also all incidents and accidents at its subsidiaries and joint ventures. The Company consolidates information about all incidents submitted in line with the Integrated HSE Management System Standard “Procedure for Reporting of Information About Incidents by Controlled Entities”. Such system enables timely response to incidents and prevention of similar events at other business units through informing and corrective action. Information is communicated to the Company employees in quarterly reviews, letters and memos.
The Company applies a consistent approach to ensure safe and accident-free operations. We assess the risks to the health and safety of employees and accident risks during the design phase of projects.
To minimize accidents and incidents, each year the Company implements prevention measures, including technical inspection, certification, test and diagnostics schedules for various types of technical equipment and structures (external and internal inspection, hydrostatic and pneumatic tests, industrial safety reviews).
NOVATEK is engaged in exploration, production, transportation, processing, and sales of natural gas and liquid hydrocarbons, which requires technical personnel to comply with OHS rules when working with complex technological processes at flammable and explosive facilities. Works and services at these hazardous production facilities (HPFs) are rendered in line with OHS laws. As of 31 December 2020, 260 HPFs were registered with territorial bodies of the Russian Federal Environmental, Industrial and Nuclear Supervision Service, including: • Class 1 (extremely hazardous) – 13 facilities; • Class 2 (highly hazardous) – 51 facilities; • Class 3 (moderately hazardous) – 174 facilities; and • Class 4 (low-hazardous) – 22 facilities.
To mitigate the risk of potential accidents and incidents at HPFs, such OHS preventive measures are taken as: • preventive inspections of equipment; • technical inspections, diagnostics of equipment, buildings and facilities; • industrial safety reviews; • development of regulations (emergency containment and management plans, spill response plans, industrial safety rules, technical regulations, to name a few); • obligatory civil liability insurance of organizations operating HPFs for damage to life, health or property of third parties and the environment; • training and certification of personnel engaged in the operation, maintenance, closure, mothballing of HPFs; • development of guidelines, use of education automation systems (OLIMP:Oks; Techexpert); and • signing agreements for servicing HPFs by emergency response and rescue teams and process safety teams.
As part of its existing risk management system, the Company also identifies and assesses risks, including.

man-made risks, such as risks of disasters, and develops measures to mitigate their impacts. To assess man-made risks at HPFs or ship transport facilities, the maximum possible losses are estimated by modelling the impact of such risks on the Company’s or third parties’ operations when preparing surveyor’s reports for risk insurance purposes or during risk assessment. The Company prepares business continuity plans for major scenarios of emergencies and incidents. The plans define the most effective measures to restart production as soon as possible and a procedure for the Group business units and employees to interact between each other and with external stakeholders with the view to maintaining critical operations at an acceptable level and reducing possible costs in case of risk realization. The first plans were approved in 2019. In 2020, the development of business continuity plans continued.
All subsidiary and joint venture HPFs have in place accident containment and response plans and emergency spill response plans, as well as running regular emergency drills. The plans cover various emergency scenarios for an HPF and accident containment and response measures. Additionally, all production facilities undergo annual preventive maintenance, as well as conduct diagnostics to prevent accidents related to loss of containment and hydrocarbon spillage and leakage.
Design documents1 provide for measures to prevent and contain accidents (including injuries to employees) that occur on-site or as a result of accidents at adjacent facilities.
The initiatives cover hazard sources, risk factors, accident causes and scenarios, and the number and location of operational staff.
Accident prevention and containment initiatives include organizational and engineering solutions to: • prevent leakages and emissions of hazardous substances in amounts harmful for operational staff and the environment; • install monitoring systems and identify explosive concentrations of hazardous substances; 1. The list of design documents is prepared under Resolution of the Russian Government No. 87 dated 16 February 2008 “On the List of Design Documentation Sections and Requirements to Their Content”.
• prevent and contain accidents related to emission (discharge) of hazardous substances; • ensure the safety of operational staff; • install automatic controls, safety trips, alarm and safety shutdown systems; • ensure accident-proof operation of production control units and systems, safety of their personnel, and process controllability during accidents; • set up back-up power supply, ventilation, water supply sources, communications systems, and materials for on-site accident response; • ensure safety and security at hazardous production facilities against unauthorized interventions, construct and install checkpoints to ensure rapid emergency evacuation of personnel with different wind directions, as well as accident alert systems; and • ensure free access and movement of rescue crews and teams across the site.
Six entities of the Company have their own certified professional emergency response and rescue teams, while other entities have signed agreements with licensed contractors.
403‑5 We conduct theory and practice courses for members of these teams to enhance the teams’ emergency preparedness and response and rescue capabilities. Training is provided through specially designed programs, while professional development and certification are provided at educational institutions.
Professional emergency response and rescue teams enhance their hands-on skills through relevant drills and training. Drill and training topics are selected based on a comprehensive assessment of existing risks inherent to the operations of our facilities exposed to fire and explosion hazards and their geographic location (the Far North).

OHS Training. 
All NOVATEK subsidiaries and joint ventures provide regular training in OHS and first aid, and are certified to industrial safety standards.
403‑4 403‑5 The Company regularly delivers training to ensure that employees are sufficiently competent in these areas. The training programs: • cover all the Company employees as per appropriate procedures; • are carried out by competent persons; • provide for effective and timely initial and refresher training at set frequency; • include feedback from trainees on how clear the course materials were and how well they have learned it; and • are regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in laws and employees’ scope of work.
Business unit leaders, including the Company top managers, take courses in training centers, while experts are offered in-house training opportunities. For that, training programs were developed, and OHS knowledge testing commissions were set up.
OG13 The Company puts emphasis on training its workers, who face various work-related hazards: using of power tools and complex equipment, working at heights and in confined spaces. Personnel must have the necessary knowledge and skills to enhance safety at workplace. To this end, the Company has in place a differentiated OHS training system for each job, including briefings and apprenticeships. Blue-collar workers undergo regular mandatory briefings, including induction, initial, refresher, unscheduled, and ad-hoc briefings. Briefings are held in line with approved programs, including skill and knowledge tests. Ad-hoc briefings are provided to employees assigned an ad-hoc job outside their respective scopes of duties. Additionally, blue-collar workers are trained in providing first aid that may be needed in emergencies and accidents. All amendments to OHS regulations and the results of accident investigations are communicated to employees at unscheduled briefings and team meetings. Briefings are held by the occupational health and safety unit and direct supervisors.
OHS training and testing take place on the job. In 2020, 30 subsidiaries and joint ventures used the OLIMP:Oks licensed automated training and knowledge testing system for testing and certifying employees. Automated programs allow to minimize the risks of cheating and falsifying testing results.
OHS certification is mandatory for managers, specialists and personnel operating hazardous production facilities (HPF) and is a key to HPF’s correct and safe operation. OHS certification process in line with applicable laws is monitored by the Federal Environmental, Industrial and Nuclear Supervision Service of Russia and is carried out through the Unified Testing Portal information system.

Defining Report content and material topics 102‑43 102‑44 102‑49 The Company identified material topics in late 2020–early 2021 as part of its Sustainability Report 2020 preparation process. The procedure was carried out in several stages: • The Company’s working group analyzed all material topics relevant to the oil and gas industry and compiled as comprehensive a list as possible.
• Based on the list of relevant topics, a questionnaire was prepared for the heads of the Company’s departments and for stakeholders. The respondents were asked to rate each topic on the following scale: no materiality – low materiality – medium materiality – high materiality – very high materiality.
• Based on the survey results, a materiality matrix was generated, where the vertical axis shows the materiality of topics to stakeholders (based on stakeholder questionnaires) and the horizontal axis shows the Company’s impact within the topics (based on questionnaires for the heads of departments). Material topics are located above the cut-off line (diagonally).
• As a result, 23 material topics were identified.
In preparing the Report’s content, all material topics were disclosed as fully as possible in terms of the description of approaches as well as 2020 performance. Quantitative information is presented for three years to ensure comparability.
Three material topics were fully disclosed for the first time in this Report: 1) Innovation; 2) Information Security; and 3) Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Company’s Business, and the Company’s Response to the Pandemic.
The Procurement topic was deemed insignificant based on the rating by the survey respondents; however, the Company continued to disclose information on this topic as the Report preparation working group deemed it important.
Principles of defining the Report content (based on GRI recommendations): • stakeholder inclusiveness; • sustainability context; • materiality; and • completeness.

APPENDIX 8. Independent Auditor’s Assurance. 
Independent Limited Assurance Report. 
To the management of PAO NOVATEK: 1. The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the Management; the work carried out by us does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, we accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the reported Selected Information or Reporting Criteria when presented on the Company’s website.
Introduction. 
We have been engaged by the management of PAO NOVATEK (the “Company”) to provide limited assurance on the selected information described below and included in the Sustainability Report of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2020 (the “Sustainability Report”).
The Sustainability Report presents information related to the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates (together – the “Group”).
Selected Information. 
We assessed the qualitative and quantitative information that is disclosed in the Sustainability Report and referred to or included in the Appendix 5 “Compliance with the GRI Standards” and in the Appendix 6 “Compliance with SASB” (the “Selected Information”). The Selected Information has been prepared in accordance with: • GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (Core option), including GRI G4 Oil & Gas Sector Disclosures (together – the “GRI Standards”) published by the Global Reporting Initiative; • Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Sustainability Accounting Standard (the “SASB Standard”) published by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), respectively.
The scope of our limited assurance procedures was limited to the Selected Information for the year ended 31 December 2020. We have not performed any procedures with respect to any other items included in the Sustainability Report and, therefore, do not express any conclusion thereon.
Reporting Criteria. 
We assessed the Selected Information using relevant criteria, including reporting principles and requirements, in the GRI Standards and the SASB Standard (the “Reporting Criteria”). We believe that the Reporting Criteria are appropriate given the purpose of our limited assurance engagement.
Responsibilities of the management of the Company. 
The Company’s management is responsible for: • designing, implementing and maintaining internal controls relevant to the preparation of the Selected Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; • establishing internal methodology, including objective reporting criteria, and guidelines for preparing and reporting the Selected Information in accordance with the Reporting Criteria; • preparing, measuring and reporting of the Selected Information in accordance with the Reporting Criteria; and • the accuracy, completeness and presentation of the Selected Information.
Our responsibilities. 
We are responsible for: • planning and performing the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Selected Information is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; • forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained; and • reporting our conclusion to the Company’s management.
This report, including our conclusion, has been prepared solely for the Company’s management in accordance with the agreement between us, to assist the management in reporting on the Group’s sustainability performance and activities. We permit this report to be disclosed in the Sustainability Report, which may be published on the Company’s website1, to assist the management in responding to their governance responsibilities by obtaining an independent limited assurance report in connection with the Selected Information. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the management of the Company for our work or this report.
Professional standards applied and level of assurance. 
We performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information’’ issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary 176 177.

Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.
Our Independence and Quality Control. 
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour, and the ethical requirements of the Auditor’s Professional Ethics Code and Auditor’s Independence Rules that are relevant to our limited assurance engagement in respect of the Selected Information in the Russian Federation. We have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Work done. 
We are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material misstatement of the Selected Information. In doing so, we: • made enquiries of the Company’s management, including the Sustainability Reporting (SR) team and those with responsibility for SR management and Group reporting; • conducted interviews of personnel responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Report and collection of underlying data; • performed an analysis of the relevant internal methodology and guidelines, gaining an understanding and evaluating the design of the key structures, systems, processes and controls for managing, recording, preparing and reporting the Selected Information; • performed limited substantive testing on a selective basis of the Selected Information to check that data had been appropriately measured, recorded, collated and reported; and • reviewed the Selected Information for compliance of the disclosures with the relevant requirements of the Reporting Criteria.
Reporting and measurement methodologies. 
Under the GRI Standards and SASB Standard there is a range of different, but acceptable, measurement and reporting techniques. The techniques can result in materially different reporting outcomes that may affect comparability with other organisations. The Selected Information should therefore be read in conjunction with the methodology used by the management in preparing the Sustainability Report, described therein, and which the Company is solely responsible for.
Limited assurance conclusion. 
Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Selected Information for the year ended 31 December 2020 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.
