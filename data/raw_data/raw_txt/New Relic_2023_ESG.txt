A Word From Our CEO. 
This year, New Relic turns 15 years old. We're proud to be an early pioneer in application performance monitoring, and we now have more engaged customers on our platform than any other.
In many ways, however, we feel that we're just getting started on our mission to help the tens of millions of engineers around the world make decisions every day using telemetry data. We’re renewing our commitment to building a more equitable and sustainable future for all, mobilizing our business, people, and resources as leaders in observability to effect positive change while meeting the demands of our customers, investors, employees, and communities.
Our ESG program is as ambitious as it is methodical. In fiscal year (FY) 2023, we began seeing the results of our strategies by operationalizing our previous ESG commitments. We’re particularly proud to be the first observability company to set a goal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 as part of our broader climate strategy. In aligning our business and sustainability goals, we are helping to slow climate change while positioning our business for long-term growth and competitive differentiation. This also allows us to evolve alongside our global customers, for whom decarbonization is becoming an increasingly important consideration when it comes to choosing technology providers.
There is always more work to build upon and new external factors to contend with, such as the macroeconomic headwinds we faced last year. This FY23 impact report reflects the resiliency and dedication built into our program, presents our outcomes since first operationalizing our ESG strategy, and allows us to look forward and share our key goals for FY24 across each of our ESG focus areas. We will continue to deepen and strengthen our commitments across these impact focus areas, leveraging our obsession with data to hold ourselves accountable for our progress. I’m proud to share this report with you and hope it grants you a better understanding of our business.

Governance of ESG Issues. 
New Relic 2023 Impact Report / Contents ↑ ©2023 New Relic, Inc.
6 of 52 Who We Are. 
We continue to deepen our commitments to ESG issues under our ESG operating team, which is led by our Director of Business Operations and ESG and our Senior Director of Social Impact and ESG.
Management of New Relic's ESG strategy is overseen by a team of three executive sponsors composed of our Chief People and Diversity Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Legal Officer, who are also some of the longesttenured leaders in the company.
This team reports directly to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (NCGC) of our Board of Directors, ensuring our ESG practices are aligned with our corporate governance, ethics, and integrity standards.
The NCGC takes into account and addresses any stockholder feedback it receives and meets biannually with executive sponsors. In turn, these executives meet monthly with the ESG operating team, who connect with Relics and other stakeholders to guide the company’s ESG strategy. The NCGC also delegates responsibility for managing and reporting on ESG impacts to a working group of leaders across the business and reviews and approves the reported information.
More information on our Board of Directors can be found in the Corporate Governance section of our website.

Who We Are. 
Our Impact Priorities and Strategy. 
New Relic has sought to grow sustainably from its founding. We began integrating ESG considerations into our operations early in our corporate history. In early FY22, we consolidated our company-wide efforts with the launch of a formal ESG program.
We partnered with Business for Social Responsibility to conduct our first materiality assessment, consulting with key internal and external stakeholders.
The material topics that we identified through this process became the pillars of our strategy, which we continued to execute in FY23. We focus our impact on the following areas:
Relics We prioritize our people above everything because we understand our success depends on their well-being and our ability to nurture their growth.
Data Security and Trust New Relic is committed to making the internet a more secure, resilient, and rights-respecting space.
Environment Doing our part to curb climate change is a foundational priority for New Relic.
Equitable Access to Tech We democratize access to observability tools through our software’s free tiers and New Relic’s commitment to open source. We enable Relics to leverage their skills, time, talents, and resources intentionally for the greater good.

Relics. 
People come first at New Relic.
We integrate equity into everything we do— from hiring and promotions to identifying potential leaders and ensuring all Relics can shape their career growth. We take a datadriven approach to supporting Relics by building programs that support their growth and nourish their development.
We continued to perfect and evolve our Flex First working model in FY23. Responding to new, postpandemic realities, we focused our efforts on developing an employee experience philosophy that includes creating the right conditions for all Relics to form meaningful connections and thrive with us.

Our Progress Highlights. 
Relics. 
Promoting a differentiated employee experience rooted in connection, belonging, and equity became a top priority in FY23; we appointed a full-time member to our People Team to lead this work.
We published a new Gender Transition and Inclusion Support Policy and developed a selfpaced training called “Building a Better New Relic for Transgender Relics.”
Recent updates to our ATS Avature allowed us to assess the effectiveness of the Mikey Rule in helping us diversify our employee population.
We have made year-on-year progress on our journey towards becoming a more diverse, equitable company. Responding to gaps identified in our data analysis, we also remain committed to deepening our work to create more career development opportunities across several historically underrepresented groups, including Hispanic/Latinx and womenidentifying people in our workforce.

Our Progress Highlights. 
Compared to FY22, we can report a significant decrease in turnover across Relics from all groups in FY23. We specifically tracked 15–20 percentage point decreases among all regions, ages, and genders. We also more than doubled Black representation among our leaders in FY23, moving up 5 points to 9%.
There is still opportunity to increase representation among women and Hispanic Relics, which will be a focus in this fiscal year. New Relic remains committed to creating an inclusive, diverse workplace, and we will continue to work towards materializing this vision year on year.

Growth and Impact. 
DEI Strategy We believe that tech companies play a vital role in eliminating systemic barriers that perpetuate inequities in the tech industry and society at large.
We take this responsibility seriously because we know that diversity is a key enabler of growth, product differentiation, and workforce engagement. It’s why we integrate DEI across all levels and aspects of our business, engaging every Relic, leader, department, and region of operation. Our DEI pillars of Engage, Scale, and Grow allow us to continually strengthen this commitment. Our most important work is framed by our Leader-led Action Plans (LLAPs), which guide our approach to expanding recruitment, retention, and career growth for underrepresented Relics. LLAPs are overseen by C-suite executives and designed to accelerate DEI throughout New Relic. Leaders build their LLAPs by evaluating their workforce demographics and setting measurable key results in order to close identified gaps across hiring, promotion, and attrition, as well in representation across leadership, technical roles, and our organization generally. In FY23, LLAPs centered on developing and diversifying our employee population by ensuring managers follow our Hiring for Success training (described below) and developing a deeper understanding of allyship that takes into account global differences.
Engage We value leaders who understand the value and importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the mission and success of New Relic.
Scale We promote deep organizational change that moves our organization’s culture, priorities, and structures towards our DEI goals and in support of our company mission.
Grow We address and mitigate implicit bias in our processes to ensure we hire and promote talent from all backgrounds.
Leadership involvement and accountability are defining features of our progress towards achieving DEI results.

Workforce Development. 
Our work environment fosters the sustained growth and success of all Relics. We accomplish this by implementing equitable hiring practices that diversify our workforce, providing transparency and agency around promotion processes, and enabling Relics to expand their skills while acquiring new ones.
Our Hiring For Success training is a major driver of this effort, giving Relics making hiring decisions the tools they need to recruit the best candidates, understand how bias can impact decisions, and how to mitigate bias in our global recruitment practices. In FY23, we deepened our efforts to improve our engagement with veteran's resumes by identifying potential barriers to mutual understanding.
New Relic supports second-chance employment. Our applications for open roles do not directly ask candidates whether they have been convicted of a crime, allowing anyone to apply. Additionally, our background check process treats every candidate on a case-bycase basis. In instances where there is a prior conviction, we take into consideration the nature of the conviction as well as the position the candidate is applying for.
Growing with New Relic We want Relics to be able to put down roots with us and flourish. In FY23, we continued defining job architectures through our Career Tracks initiative, which provides transparent career paths for Relics by clearly outlining the expectations, skills, and abilities associated with each role. This helps managers and employees to measure progress, evaluate promotion readiness, and identify development opportunities. We also launched speed mentoring and speed networking, allowing global Relics to grow their internal networks and gain exposure to different career paths and peer-to-peer mentorship. Our DEI team also held discussion sessions that combined career track overviews with stories from underrepresented leaders about their professional journeys to underscore the importance of representation, diverse career paths, and peer connection.
We also prioritize developing early career talent through our robust internship programs, supporting a diverse talent pipeline for future growth. We are currently focused on reaching out to college students from underrepresented groups, especially those enrolled in historically Black colleges (HBCUs). Our summer 2022 internships provided meaningful experiences to 50 college students, 92% of whom hailed from underrepresented groups.

Connection and Belonging. 
In a world where work is increasingly defined by virtual experiences, we’re pioneering initiatives that cultivate a sense of interconnectedness among our global Relics.
Building a Better New Relic for All Supporting a vibrant, diverse workforce starts with deep listening and understanding. In Q2, we conducted a career development needs assessment for Relics who identify as women globally and for Relics in technical roles in the U.S. who identify as Black, Indigenous, and/or People of Color (BIPOC). Our assessment showed that while Relics have confidence in their ability to perform their jobs, they would like more mentorship, time to pursue role-specific and technical learning, as well as a greater understanding of other internal career opportunities. We have taken careful note of these needs, and will mobilize our resources to create strategies that respond to them.
In an effort to provide greater support to our LGBTQIA+ Relics, we published a new Gender Transition and Inclusion Support Policy, which outlines manager and team responsibilities in supporting non-binary and transitioning Relics. We also developed a self-paced training called “Building a Better New Relic for Transgender Relics,” which sheds light on how to support transitioning employees and provides information about language, pronoun use, and the difference between gender identity and sexual orientation.
We invest in conferences and partnerships that engage and tap into pools of top underrepresented talent. These activities bring critical value to New Relic’s efforts to build a more diverse, inclusive company.
Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) Our ERGs are instrumental to moving New Relic towards ever greater inclusion and connection. They provide Relics with community, support, career and personal development opportunities, and access to peers who share commonalities and interests. ERGs receive our complete organizational support, including funding, executive sponsorship, and committee members that help drive shared activities.
ERGs are the beating heart that powers New Relic’s commitments to celebrating cultural diversity as well as heritage and awareness moments. Every year, ERGs play a vital role in bringing communities together through both in-person and virtual gatherings for Relics and our customers.
Our C-suite executives are highly involved in supporting the development of ERG leaders. Executives meet with ERG leaders biannually to understand community needs, annual plans, and key challenges. In FY23 we also launched informal job shadowing that paired five ERG leaders with executives, including our CEO.
“In-person events are valuable opportunities to further promote belonging at New Relic—the sense of connectedness and joy is always palpable."

Supporting Relics Wherever They Are As employers, we want Relics’ experience with us to have a positive impact on their lives and their loved ones. Due to the nature of our skilled workforce, we pay well above a “living wage” standard in all of our locations, which allows our Relics to enjoy a standard of living above simply meeting basic needs. We also include compensation information in specific job postings (that is, a reasonable estimate of the listed position's pay range, other compensation and incentives, and benefits) to promote pay transparency and equity and to comply with applicable law.

Sustainable Productivity. 
New Relic adheres to the philosophy of sustainable productivity, making sure we support all facets of Relics’ well-being with policies and professional environments that empower them to do their best work.
Relic Health and Safety New Relic reopened offices worldwide in May 2022 with a reduced footprint, providing more workspace flexibility for Relics. We strongly encourage Relics to get vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus and support local vaccination requirements for workplace attendance. Since our last report and in response to changing conditions in the pandemic, we have discontinued our policy of requiring vaccination. We continue to encourage employee health and workplace safety.
Mental Health and Well-being Wellness is woven into our people strategy and we promote a culture of learning around topics related to mental health. In FY23, we expanded our efforts by hosting 22 wellness events and several talks on topics ranging from emotional health to neurodivergent communications and impostor syndrome. We also partnered with The Black Girl Doctor to offer Relics several new trainings geared at supporting mental well-being.

In the coming fiscal year, we will continue promoting a culture rooted in our values, one that allows Relics to be the best version of themselves at work in order to support New Relic’s mission. We will continue to build an organization that welcomes diversity and creates equitable opportunities for all Relics to thrive, raising the bar on this front through our high-performance culture.
We will promote sustainable productivity so that Relics are energized rather than depleted by the pace of their work by refreshing our Flex First team agreements; this will include a template for aligning on team collaboration hours and launching our Thriving in Flex First Playbook.
We will invest in programs that drive sound performance management, ensuring that all Relics have clear, challenging goals and a deeper understanding and connection to our company strategy.
We will deliver specialized programming to continue to elevate our leadership capabilities.
We will launch an international career development program for women in EMEA and APJ called Set to Augment Results (STAR).
We will enhance our commitment to pay equity by launching a new strategy covering our philosophy on pay transparency.
We will deliver training on global cultural competency to ensure Relics have the knowledge and skills needed to be successful in today’s interconnected global world.

New Relic’s approach to security and privacy is principles-based. We keep customers and the public informed about our privacy practices through our General Privacy Notice and Services Data Privacy Notice, which cover our collection, use, and disclosure of personal data, and how individuals can exercise their privacy rights.
Customers can find tools, resources, and additional information on data security and privacy in New Relic’s privacy documentation.
Securing Customer Data We are constantly evaluating and enhancing our internal cybersecurity and engineering standards. We use industry standards such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to measure and evaluate the effectiveness of our cybersecurity controls and risk management strategy. Improving customer-facing security issues is likewise a top priority as we continue to maintain a variety of certifications critical to our customers and set up audit responses for customer requests regarding the handling of their data.
More information on New Relic’s approach to security policies and procedures is detailed in our Security Policy.
Improved Governance and Assurance We have further improved alignment and collaboration between our SLC and product management teams to guide secure, compliant development from design to launch. The creation of our SLC team has standardized internal processes by allowing our engineers to integrate security and legal considerations into their workflows.
Developing the organizational muscle we need to respond to a changing technology and regulatory environment ultimately benefits our customers. In keeping with our privacy by design principles, we enable New Relic’s developers to build security into products through our Secure Software Development Lifecycle initiative, which includes risk assessment, threat modeling, secure coding practices, and other best practices. Moreover, our new Vulnerability Management Tool empowers customers—and New Relic—with greater visibility into potential security issues and facilitates prioritization.

Data Security and Privacy. 
Data Security and Trust. 
Regulatory Compliance We diligently comply with regulatory requirements surrounding privacy. To that end, New Relic signs the following: (i) Data Protection Addendums with updated EU and UK standard contractual clauses (SCCs) and the Swiss addendum, (ii) Service Provider Addendums to meet the requirements of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) that also incorporates other state privacy laws such as those from Virginia, Connecticut, Colorado, and Utah. New Relic’s Vendor Code of Conduct lays out our expectation for vendors to respect and uphold our core values when doing business with us.
We also make corresponding amendments to applicable vendor agreements. Our Security Policy has been updated to address the technical and organizational measures specified in Annex II of the SCCs, making it easier for customers to comply with their own regulatory requirements and understand how New Relic is upholding its obligations. We have also revised customer-facing materials and FAQs surrounding the SCCs and Service Provider Addendum updates, facilitating access to the latest terms and appropriate clauses for conducting international data transfers as well as making it easier to track and match regulatory requirements.
To further strengthen our data governance, we have improved automation of our data mapping and work processing records through a strong relationship with data governance and compliance services. We also consolidated our audit process in FY23 and are expanding our internal controls compliance, such as the SOC 2 Type 2 report.
Vendor and Export Compliance New Relic values its relationships with its suppliers and their role in helping us maintain our core values of accountability, authenticity, and connectedness. As part of our supply chain management, New Relic considers vendors’ ability to operate in accordance with these values by looking at their commitment to meeting compliance obligations like trade control, conflicts of interest, and protecting human rights.
We do not discriminate against any world regions in offering our services; exclusion decisions are made in response to extreme factors like war and to comply with the law or sanctions applied for ethical reasons. In the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we took swift, decisive action to conform with changes to export laws stemming from the crisis.

Systemic Risks From Technology Disruptions Emerging Technology and Ethics. 
Data Security and Trust. 
New Relic continually improves its preparedness to handle potential service disruptions and works to identify operational risks. We maintain a Business Continuity Plan, which we review on an annual basis. This helps New Relic mitigate potential disruptions through contingency strategies to help maintain operations and enable us to deliver quality client services.
In line with our commitment to transparency, customers can monitor and receive notifications on product status by region and stay informed about any outages or interruptions in real time through our status page. We help enable customers to plan ahead by informing them of upcoming maintenance periods in advance, and prioritize performing scheduled maintenance when we anticipate it will be least disruptive for the majority of our customers.
New Relic is a data-driven company built by engineers for engineers. Our customers are contractually prohibited from sending us inappropriate or sensitive data that would be used to violate human rights. ` As New Relic evolves, we will continue to develop our technology ethically and responsibly—and we expect our customers to engage with our services in the same way. We are always vigilant about reported misuse of our platform. This includes terminating accounts that violate our Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy.

Building Our Climate Strategy. 
When we developed our ESG strategy in FY22, we identified "environment" as our biggest area of opportunity and established data baselines to understand our (GHG) emissions. We continued to build on this work over the last fiscal year by holding discussions with Relics across our business and identifying opportunities for carbon reductions.
Together with qb. consulting, a women-owned ESG strategy and communications firm, we developed a formal climate strategy in Q4. Our goal to reach net-zero GHG emissions by 2030 is the cornerstone of this strategy, making New Relic the first observability company to declare this objective. Our climate strategy includes continual review of our GHG emissions inventory, committing to developing a plan to reduce emissions for facilities and assets, setting incremental targets, and reporting on our progress. We are also focused on improving the efficiency of our cloud use and inspiring our customers, partners, and suppliers to follow our lead. We are building our platform with several cloud providers to ensure New Relic can take advantage of the strongest environmental policies.
NET EMISSIONS. 
FY20: 45,920 TCO₂EQ FY21: 29,355 TCO₂EQ FY22: 33,216 TCO₂EQ FY23: 42,829 TCO₂EQ • cloud 45.41% • goods + services 22.00% • travel 8.69% • offices 7.60% • data centers 7.34% • marketing 4.73% • employees 4.23%
FY23 EMISSIONS BY CATEGORY. 
New Relic uses climate solutions platform Watershed to calculate our greenhouse gas emissions. Some of our emissions categories were subject to Watershed's methodology changes based on changes in climate science, changes in the world, and improvements in Watershed's methodology. For our FY23 footprint, we adjusted methodology assumptions related to the Covid19 pandemic. Impacted categories that increased due to these methodology changes include: employees, offices, goods + services, marketing, cloud usage, travel, and data centers. For FY23, New Relic moved from a fully spendbased estimate of cloud and data center emissions to a more granular and accurate activity-based measurement for cloud and data center emissions. Electricity usage emissions resulting from an activity based measurement can result in higher total MWh consumption year-over-year when this change is made due to the consumption actuals being higher than previously estimated averages. Activity-based measurement allows for more granular measurement of electricity used for compute and networking, which can lead to higher consumption numbers. In addition, New Relic’s cloud usage increased in FY23, contributing to the increase in total MWh electricity emissions.

Net-Zero by 2030. 
Net-zero means eliminating emissions to the greatest extent possible and offsetting any residual emissions with measurable removals.
New Relic is underscoring this commitment by submitting its GHG emissions targets to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), joining a global community of companies that are leading the transition to a net-zero economy. Setting 2030 as our target gives us the space to engage in rigorous work to achieve our goals. This date is also in line with guidance from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which has urged limiting global warming to 1.5°C (equivalent to 2.7°F) by 2050 to avoid the worst consequences of climate change.
OUR STRATEGY RESTS ON THE FOLLOWING PILLARS Vendor Engagement on Climate. 
Internal Efficiencies and Tracking. 
Reduced Operational Footprint. 
Policy Setting and Leadership Engagement. 
We’re convinced that our business will be better-positioned for long-term growth and competitive differentiation by adhering to science-backed emissions targets and contributing to decarbonization.
Vendor Engagement on Climate We are beginning to work with vendors to understand and reduce their operational emissions. This will allow us to align on a collective path forward that is compatible with our climate goals. Cloud infrastructure represents the biggest portion of New Relic’s total footprint at 45%, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) currently making up the bulk of those emissions. Our top vendors—Amazon, IBM, Google, Microsoft—have all published near-term reductions targets. We are also helping our customers optimize their own cloud usage through our Cloud Optimize open source app, which allows them to view their AWS EC2 data on our platform in order to reduce costs by identifying opportunities to drive operational efficiencies.
Internal Efficiencies and Tracking We continue to refine our GHG emissions calculations using Watershed, a climate solutions platform, through which we’re able to gain a fine-grained understanding of our environmental impact. For increased accountability, we are disclosing climate-related risks and opportunities in this report in accordance with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework.
We are constantly re-evaluating our internal processes to home in on emissions reduction opportunities. Our Product teams are always working to iron out inefficiencies in our code, resulting in a platform that uses less energy. We’ve also migrated nearly 50% of our Kubernetes workloads to AWS Graviton processors, resulting in better performance per watt than any other AWS processor.
Reduced Operational Footprint New Relic continually assesses its operational footprint and ensures climate remains a part of our criteria. We are currently in the process of reducing our real estate portfolio to meet our current demand as a Flex First company. In September 2022, we began efforts to reduce our operational footprint and are assessing the impact of these efforts on New Relic’s energy consumption. Policy Setting and Leadership Engagement We’re introducing and updating internal policies across New Relic’s business to ensure climate is a shared responsibility.
One of the ways we do this is by providing Relics with disposal and recycling options for electronic waste, the fastest growing waste stream in the world. We facilitate quarterly electronic waste disposals at all our offices globally in partnership with Revivn, a hardware lifecycle management platform for disposing of information technology (IT) assets. Our Social Impact and IT teams partnered on a campaign with DonorsChoose to direct $54,231, accumulated over several years of equipment buyback funds, to support instructional technology projects for teachers in historically underfunded schools.
We have also created a travel policy with climate language to reduce travel. Internally, we utilize TripActions to report on our GHG emissions data for corporate travel. This information is shared with cost center managers every quarter. This will allow us to reevaluate our progress towards our emissions reduction goals and improve emissions tracking.

Tech for Good. 
New Relic supports the tech solutions that our world needs through NewRelic.org, our social impact division. We listen attentively to the nonprofits we join forces with to build lasting, meaningful relationships.
Observability for Good and Pro Bono Our Observability for Good mission and team unlock more New Relic for nonprofits—for free. In addition to New Relic’s free tier, which is available to any user, we provide eligible organizations with access to up to five standard users and a terabyte of data per month at no charge. More information on our free-tier offerings can be found on our website.
Twice a year, we also engage Relics in a two-week sprint supporting nonprofit customers through skills-based pro bono work. The long-term relationships we cultivate as part of pro bono work familiarize us with the organizations we work with on a deep level, allowing us to transcend our role as software vendors in order to become true partners.
Impact Fund In May, we launched New Relic’s first Impact Fund as a new program and complement to our Tech for Good mission and initiatives. We invited nonprofits in the US to participate in a $100,000 funding round by applying for grants related to digital transformation. As a result, we selected five grantees from a pool of 115. We were not exclusively focused on funding nonprofit organizations who are Observability for Good customers.
Grantee Spotlight: Supporting the Fight Against Homelessness Central City Concern (CCC) is dedicated to ending homelessness by taking a holistic, people-centric approach that supports housing, employment, social, enterprise, and case management services for their clients. To provide these services, CCC had historically relied on spreadsheets, outdated tracking methods, and databases that no longer served their needs. This changed in February, when New Relic's Impact Fund grant provided CCC with the backing it needed to implement powerful case management software that has transformed the way staff can leverage tech to serve clients.
Offering transparency and a centralized database for tracking all of their services in one place, it has been a major improvement for CCC. The system allows staff to easily see how clients are engaging with other internal services, who they are being served by, and where they are living in CCC’s housing portfolio. In time, this observability will enable the organization’s teams to better deliver on their mission by empowering them to make data-driven decisions that improve client outcomes.

Inspiring the Next Generation of Technologists. 
In addition to supporting organizations harnessing tech for good, New Relic is also committed to helping develop the technologists of the future.
Students pursuing any educational path—from the university-enrolled to those in tech bootcamps—can access New Relic for Students through our partners or via GitHub Education. Qualifying students get 500 GB of data ingest and up to three full platform users to learn, collaborate, and innovate with. Recently, New Relic partnered with Platzi, an online learning platform that caters to students in Latin America, to create Portuguese and Spanish-language content on observability.
Ensuring equitable access to tech for everyone requires us to be engaged members of our communities. We value our partnerships with nonprofit organizations because they amplify our ability to meet the needs of future technologists. Relics engage with learners within the context of these partnerships by showcasing their careers and illuminating paths to securing tech jobs.

In the spirit of furthering access and collaboration, New Relic has been an active member of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) since 2018, and we’re top contributors to CNCF’s OpenTelemetry and Pixie projects. Last fiscal year, we were proud to see a dedicated group of Relics appointed as maintainers and technical committee members of the OpenTelemetry community, which has recognized our contributions towards advancing open source standards.
Our Commitment to Open Source. 
Equitable Access to Tech. 
Enabling Relics to Give Back With Intention. 
We are continuously finding new ways to foster connection and engage Relics as a distributed, Flex First company.
We enable Relics to approach their volunteer work with intention and give them the tools to think critically about their own impact in order to maximize it.
Volunteerism, giving, and educational programs are crucial to mobilizing Relics to make a difference. Every Relic has 16 hours of paid volunteer time off each year in addition to our annual day of service. In Q3, we activated Relics for our second annual 21 Days of Goodness & Day of Service campaign. Relics showed up powerfully for others by donating more than $138,000 and volunteering 4,020 hours across 137 projects.

Stakeholder Engagement. 
Listening to Relics We listen deeply to Relics through our employee surveys and strive to offer them a more perfect work experience. In April, we conducted our first survey with Culture Amp. Approximately 83% of Relics took this survey, and we’re proud to report a very favorable 70% overall engagement score, up 17 points from the previous fiscal year. The Relic survey delivers insights into how employees feel about action, leadership, service, and quality of work at New Relic. While progress was evident on all fronts, we will continue to listen closely and improve the quality of experience we create for Relics.
A follow-up Relic Pulse Survey in October engaged employees to think critically about how to tackle the improvements needed to make our company stronger. An outstanding 90% of Relics participated and shared their candid feedback. The data gleaned from this survey was studied carefully by our CEO and C-suite executives to uncover opportunities for change.
We conducted our first Global Benefits Survey in July, in which over half of Relics participated. Their feedback is essential to our ongoing efforts to provide market-competitive benefits to employees globally. This year's data will serve as a baseline for future benefits surveys. Though we understand there is always room to improve, we are pleased to share that this survey showed Relics appreciate their existing coverage, feel our benefits package is inclusive and accessible, and are satisfied with the company’s contribution towards their coverage.
Listening and Responding to Customer Feedback Our business model is tied to customer success. By incorporating customer feedback into our processes, we are able to continuously learn, adapt, and innovate to meet their needs through our product and go-to-market strategy.
We embed customer feedback into our product at various stages of product development. Common customer pain points surface in both our Explorers Hub community forum and Global Technical Support tickets, and these are regularly analyzed and have direct influence on our product roadmap. Furthermore, we run product preview (beta) programs to get early feedback on new features and encourage open and transparent dialogue. We work closely with our customers through dedicated customerfacing roles, including sales, technical, and support staff and provide opportunities for in-person connection around the world. These include FutureStack regional user conferences, FutureHACK design thinking workshops, industry developer events, and user group meet-ups. We also gather direct feedback through focus group surveys, account team surveys, and industry research, which culminates in the publication of our Annual Observability Study.

New Relic uses climate solutions platform Watershed to calculate our greenhouse gas emissions. Some of our emissions categories were subject to Watershed's methodology changes based on changes in climate science, changes in the world, and improvements in Watershed's methodology. For our FY23 footprint, we adjusted methodology assumptions related to the Covid19 pandemic. Impacted categories that increased due to these methodology changes include: employees, offices, goods + services, marketing, cloud usage, travel, and data centers. For FY23, New Relic moved from a fully spendbased estimate of cloud and data center emissions to a more granular and accurate activity-based measurement for cloud and data center emissions. Electricity usage emissions resulting from an activity based measurement can result in higher total MWh consumption year-over-year when this change is made due to the consumption actuals being higher than previously estimated averages. Activity-based measurement allows for more granular measurement of electricity used for compute and networking, which can lead to higher consumption numbers. In addition, New Relic’s cloud usage increased in FY23, contributing to the increase in total MWh electricity emissions.
The data in this table is rounded to the nearest whole number and the totals represent sums of the rounded numbers.
