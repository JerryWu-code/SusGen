Strong growth and increased profitability – focus on sustainability-driven markets 17 Annual Report 2021


Annual Report 2021. 
Dear shareholders,
In 2021, the first year of the new strategy cycle 2021–2025, GF delivered a strong result in terms of profit and sales growth. The strategic focus on promising resilient end markets, especially those that center on sustainability, has powered the company’s performance over the year, supporting GF’s business model. In addition, business segments such as the building technology and utility sector, have rebounded, despite ongoing headwinds in the markets. GF weathered the persisting macroeconomic uncertainties well, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the semiconductor shortages, supply chain disruptions, and increasing raw material prices.
During the year, GF employees continued to adapt to digitalized ways of working, including attending major events online, such as customer experience days, global HR meetings, as well as internal and external trainings. This was due to a resurgence of COVID-19 in the second half of the year and tighter pandemic-related restrictions. We wish to thank the GF team worldwide for their dedication, flexibility, and for their enthusiasm in taking new and sometimes unexpected paths, in line with GF’s purpose “Becoming better every day – since 1802”.
Corporate results. 
GF sales in 2021 amounted to CHF 3’722 million (2020: CHF 3’184 million), boosted by the successful development of multiple segments, including data centers, e-mobility, and MedTech. All three divisions recorded a solid development in China, adding to remarkable growth in the Americas and Europe. Organically, sales increased by 15.9%, reflecting the resilient portfolio of all divisions and the rebound of various markets (e.g. ICT, mold and die, water treatment, chemical process industry, ship building), and offsetting the subdued performance in the aerospace and automotive sectors. Price increases contributed positively to sales growth and underlined the strong market position of GF. The operating result (EBIT) reached CHF 278 million, after a solid second half of the year (2020: CHF 185 million EBIT before one-offs). The EBIT margin rose to 7.5% (2020: 5.8% EBIT margin before one-offs).
The return on invested capital (ROIC) reached 16.4% (2020: 9.3%), with GF Piping Systems achieving a remarkable level of 32.1% (2020: 24.2%), surpassing the target range set in the Strategy 2025. At the end of 2021, 15’111 employees worked for GF, compared with 14’118 employees at year-end 2020. GF further reinforced its balance sheet through its successful business activities, which resulted in a high level of liquidity and a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.1 (2020: 0.4) at the end of the year. The equity ratio stood at a solid 39.7% (2020: 40.3%).
Yves Serra, Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Andreas Müller, CEO. 
Net profit attributable to shareholders of GF amounted to CHF 214 million (2020: CHF 116 million). A strong fourth quarter led to an increase in net working capital that affected the free cash flow before acquisitions, which reached a solid level of CHF 151 million (2020: CHF 230 million).
Earnings per share were up 86% to CHF 52 (2020: CHF 28). At the upcoming annual shareholders’ meeting, the Board of Directors will propose a dividend per share of CHF 20 (2020: CHF 15 per share).

Annual Report 2021. 
GF Piping Systems. 
In line with the Strategy 2025, GF Piping Systems focused on growing high-value businesses that address important sustainability needs. This focus paid off and the division reported record results in all major markets. With strong recoveries in Industry, Utility, and Building Technology, business grew organically by 14.3%, leading to total sales of CHF 1’971 million in 2021 (2020: CHF 1’708 million). The strong market position allowed the division to increase its prices by around 6%, offsetting rising costs.
EBIT in 2021 rose to CHF 247 million, compared with CHF 193 million in the previous year. This significant improvement resulted in an EBIT margin of 12.5%, compared with last year’s EBIT margin of 11.3%.
During 2021, the division invested significantly in future growth and further strengthened its position in the microelectronics and data center segments, complementing traditional strongholds in water treatment, urban infrastructures, and building technology.
2021 also marked an important cornerstone for GF Piping Systems as a sustainability leader: with the recent launch of the first bio-attributed PVC pipes and fittings products, the division is contributing to the reduction of the carbon footprint of both its operations and those of its customers. With GF supplied fittings, valves, and pipes, the division also contributes to the development and use of green hydrogen as a power source and to the distribution of green hydrogen in gas networks.
GF Casting Solutions. 
GF Casting Solutions has taken a predominant role in the area of sustainable mobility. With its focus on lightweight components, the division is set to benefit increasingly from the growing hybrid and e-vehicle demand across all major regions. This is expected to result in a steady increase of sales of electric vehicle components in the years to come. In 2021, orders for e-vehicle components represented CHF 430 million or 43% of lifetime order intake.
GF Casting Solutions recorded promising signs of recovery in the first half of the year, whereas the chip shortage in the second half caused significant reductions of call-offs worldwide. Nevertheless, in 2021, the division reported CHF 880 million in sales, a 17.1% increase compared with 2020. Organically, sales increased 15.9%. EBIT reached CHF 5 million, compared with a negative EBIT the year before, while the EBIT margin came in at 0.5%, above last year’s negative EBIT margin of –2.0% before one-offs.
In addition to call-off reductions, the divisional performance was impacted by labor shortages in the US, as well as the steep price increases for raw materials, such as aluminum and magnesium. These can be recouped only with a time lag of approximately three months. However, metal price increases resulted in sales growth of around 6%.
The new light metal foundry in Mills River (US) was clearly contributing to the sales growth in 2021 of the division and continues to enjoy a full order book. However, the aforementioned headwinds heavily hit the facility, which is still ramping up, causing a negative impact on the operating profit of the site and the division.
The new plant in Shenyang (China) is well on track and will start production toward the end of 2022, earlier than initially planned. This will allow the division to better serve its customers in the world’s largest car market in line with its strategic target to further globalize the business and focus on lightweight components.

Annual Report 2021. 
GF Machining Solutions. 
At the leading EMO trade fair in Milan (Italy), the division presented its next generation of innovations and new technologies. With its new EDM and laser machines as well as new digital services, GF Machining Solutions continues to be one of the technology leaders in the machine tool business. This is also underscored by the successful opening of a new center of competence in Schorndorf (Germany), exclusively focused on servicing the growing medical segment. The integration of a machine service provider in France and the development of new service offerings are driving the division’s ambition to strengthen this business segment.
Order intake for the division grew significantly in 2021 (+33.3%), especially in segments such as MedTech, ICT, and high-precision solutions for e-mobility applications. Despite supply chain disruptions and a still subdued aerospace sector, GF Machining Solutions increased its sales by 20.3% to CHF 873 million (2020: CHF 725 million) with automation, laser, and EDM technologies as strong drivers of the business. The operating result (EBIT) reached CHF 47 million (2020: CHF 20 million), corresponding to a doubled EBIT margin of 5.4% compared with last year. Due to supply contracts with long duration, the increase in raw materials prices had a minor effect on 2021 sales.
COVID-19 pandemic accelerated transformation. 
The COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a major impact on GF’s 2021 business year. Supply bottlenecks, shortages of raw materials and components, as well as increases in personnel expenses and raw material prices, challenged the company globally. In order to offset the effects of the pandemic, various internal and external processes were established, simplified, and accelerated thanks to digitalization. The safety and health of our employees had always first priority.
2021 marked the launch of GF’s new strategy cycle, which emphasizes the central role of innovation.
Strategy 2025: Roll-out on track, “Culture Movement” kick-off 2021 marked the launch of GF’s new strategy cycle, which emphasizes the central role of innovation. The five-year plan addresses the three strategic focus areas profitable growth, portfolio resilience, and a “go for the full potential” spirit to further evolve into a performance and learning culture. Addressing the first strategic focus area, all three divisions shifted their sales efforts and innovation focus toward intelligent and sustainable solutions. In order to increase its robustness through portfolio additions and operational excellence, GF continued to invest and expand into less cyclical businesses, such as the water and gas business in Brazil, but also further strengthened its market segment organizations (e.g. water treatment, e-mobility, MedTech) in all three divisions in 2021. GF also kicked off the “Culture Movement” to unleash the full potential of GF through a series of initiatives such as the implementation of the new corporate values related to Caring, Learning, and Performance.
Sustainability drives performance, strategic direction pays off. 
Sustainability plays an integral role in the successful implementation of the Strategy 2025, and offers growth opportunities in all GF divisions and businesses. GF’s product range is increasingly geared to providing sustainability benefits and supporting our customers in reaching their own sustainability goals. At the same time, it reinforces GF’s long-term growth initiatives and the generation of sustainable performance. In 2021, GF was included in the newly launched SPI ESG Index and defended its position in the annual review of the SXI Swiss Sustainability 25 Index. GF also achieved the best possible rating (score of 1) in the environmental category of the ISS Quality Score Rating, and retained its strong position in the CDP ranking for its efforts to tackle climate change and improve water security. In addition, GF raised its overall score in the S&P Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA) to 60/100 in 2021, up from 33/100 in 2020 and above the industry average of 28/100.

Annual Report 2021. 
Share split and proposed changes to the Board of Directors. 
At the upcoming annual shareholder’s meeting on 20 April 2022, the Board of Directors will propose a stock split in the ratio of 1:20, resulting in 82’017’960 registered shares at a nominal value of CHF 0.05 each. This split is designed to facilitate the trading activity of GF shares also for retail investors. The first day of trading for the split shares is planned for the end of April 2022 after the payment of the proposed dividend.
As previously announced, the Board of Directors will also propose Ms. Ayano Senaha for election as a new member of the Board. The 39-year-old Japanese national is currently serving as COO and Board Member of Recruit Holdings in Tokyo, a pioneer in the digitalized job search business and the world leader in web matching services through its Indeed brand. With this nomination, the Board of Directors is further expanding increasingly important competencies in digitalization, sustainability, and governance in a targeted manner.
GF’s product range is increasingly geared to providing sustainability benefits.
Outlook for the full year 2022. 
The new Strategy 2025 inspired and motivated GF’s employees worldwide to continue to expand business activities and to proactively contribute to the implementation of the new vision. GF started 2022 with a promising order book and favorable momentum in all divisions. GF Piping Systems can rely on its strong position in several end markets, as well as the ongoing shift to higher value businesses and the growing sustainability needs of its customers. For GF Casting Solutions, the global chip shortage should gradually abate somewhat in the course of the year and enable the division to further benefit from the shift in the automotive industry toward e-mobility. The aerospace segment is still subdued, but shows signs of a mild recovery, supporting the development of two divisions. The positive momentum at GF Machining Solutions in the fourth quarter of 2021 is expected to continue in the coming months.
Geopolitical tensions and supply chain constraints make forecasting difficult. Assuming the issues abate and barring unforeseen circumstances, GF expects in 2022 for both sales and profit a further step towards the achievement of its Strategy 2025 targets.
We thank you, our shareholders, for the continued trust you place in us. Our heartfelt thanks also go to our employees, business partners, and customers.
Yves Serra Chairman of the Board of Directors. 
Andreas Müller CEO 21


Strategy 2025: Roll-out activities in the first year of the cycle. 
GF’s Strategy 2025 builds on the promising path pursued over the last five years and addresses profitable growth, portfolio resilience, and a “go for the full potential” spirit within the organization.

GF Machining Solutions displayed several manufacturing innovations at the EMO Milano trade fair, underscoring how the division continues to collaborate with its customers to create new solutions. These innovations combine the experience and application expertise of both parties to provide effective solutions for manufacturing success. The first Energy Efficiency Certificates were introduced for various machines to document energy savings. To reduce the organization’s carbon footprint, GF Machining Solutions is using mainly energy from natural resources. The company’s material sustainability impacts are constantly assessed based on documented evidence to improve the supply chain.

About Hitachi Energy and Georg Fischer AB. 
Hitachi Energy, which is based in Ludvika (Sweden), pioneered commercial HVDC technology more than 65 years ago. The company is supplying high-voltage systems to connect the offshore wind farm at Dogger Bank. Hitachi Energy has realized more than half of the world’s HVDC projects. Hitachi Energy describes this technology as a key for enabling the clean energy transition. GF Piping Systems serves about 500 customers in all business areas in Sweden and Finland through its company Georg Fischer AB. The GF pre-fabrication site in Avesta (Sweden) primarily serves customers in the energy, pharmaceutical, chemical, and marine industries. In 2021, Georg Fischer AB celebrated its 50th anniversary in the Nordics.
By moving away from coal, natural gas, and CO2 emissions, Britain’s energy generation is becoming more renewable. Against this backdrop, the country is forging ahead with expanding its environmentally friendly wind energy generation. The North Sea offers ideal conditions to this end.
GF has been committed to developing solutions for efficient energy production for many years, and in doing so, has been supporting the global trend towards the more intelligent and sustainable use of resources.

GF solutions for the energy transition. 
On the Dogger Bank sandbank, around 130 kilometers off the North Sea coast of Britain, construction is underway on what will eventually be the largest offshore wind farm in the world. Once up and running, several hundred wind energy systems will convert the strong North Sea winds into environmentally friendly electricity. Several hundred kilometers of submarine cables will enable distribution to land without any significant losses. Three Hitachi Energy conversion stations on the high seas and three on land will convert the energy from alternating (AC) to direct current (DC).
Because this conversion process generates heat, GF Piping Systems in Sweden has developed a solution to cool the valves: fire and heat-resistant, long-lasting PVDF structures. Since 2020, the GF team in Avesta (Sweden) has planned and produced 48 prefabricated PVDF structures, including thousands of quality-assured welds using IR technology on behalf of Hitachi Energy. Two of the three wind farm sectors will use these deionized water-based systems.
“Trust is key in a project like this. We share information with Hitachi Energy and openly discuss what is possible and what’s not.”
Johan Martinsson, Site Manager of the GF Prefabrication Service Center in Avesta 43


Annual Report 2021. 
GF’s PVDF solutions are in demand not only among companies in the energy sector but also in the microelectronics sector for semiconductor, photovoltaics, and TFT/LED production as well as in industries that require piping systems for the transportation of acids and water.
Local presence and global network. 
For the Dogger Bank project, the GF team in Avesta has put its many years of experience in the energy sector to good use: “Over the past 20 years, we have successfully completed several projects together with Hitachi Energy. For example, the grid connection of a wind farm in Germany,” says Johan Martinsson, Site Manager Prefabrication at GF Piping Systems and Key Account Manager for Hitachi Energy, a long-standing and important customer for GF in northern Europe. “Our recipe for success is a good combination of local presence and global network,” he says. The city of Ludvika (Sweden), where Hitachi Energy is based, is a little under an hour’s drive from GF Piping Systems in Avesta, meaning shorter delivery routes for the modules. Within GF, the team in Avesta was able to count on the full support and expertise of other sites: the individual PVDF pipes were manufactured at GF in Ettenheim (Germany) and assembled into modules at GF in Avesta, after which they were transported to Ludvika. The Advanced Engineering team from Schaffhausen (Switzerland) contributed the necessary load and fatigue assessments. These computer simulations ensure that the PVDF modules can withstand the movements that take place during sea transportation. The unique combination of static load calculation and fatigue assessment is also greatly valued by other companies in the energy sector.
Dogger Bank Wind Farm will power six million British households with environmentally friendly electricity. GF Piping Systems will continue to contribute to the broader success story of the wind farm.

About Sinotruk. 
Founded in 1930 in Jinan (China), Sinotruk is one of China’s oldest truck makers. In 1960, it manufactured the country’s first heavy-duty truck – the Yellow River JN150; in 1983, it became the first company to import overseas technologies from Austrian manufacturer STR. For decades, despite fierce competition, Sinotruk remained one of the top truck brands in China; today, the company is trying to claim the crown by rolling out better designs faster than its competitors.
GF Casting Solutions is helping customers worldwide with its innovative, lightweight automotive parts. These include assembly brackets, for example, made of new high-tech alloys adapted for special use cases and properties, such as strength or heat resistance, instead of ordinary iron. In China, where ambitious emission targets have been officially set, GF is working with leading truck maker Sinotruk on the construction of next-generation vehicles that meet some of the world’s strictest emission standards.
Since 2015, GF Casting Solutions’ Kunshan plant, some 60 kilometers west of Shanghai (both China), has been supplying Sinotruk with a series of lightweight parts that have brought weight reductions of around 15–20 percent compared with the previous components, including bogie anchorages, cross beams and various types of brackets. The weight reductions have helped Sinotruk become more competitive in its domestic market with new trucks that both reduce harmful emissions and are cheaper to operate.

Annual Report 2021. 
Richard Zhang, GF Casting Solutions “China has committed to reaching its carbon emission peak by 2030, which means cutting emissions is a must for industries across the board.” 50


Annual Report 2021. 
Trusting relationship despite tight deadlines “The Chinese market evolves very quickly, and new trucks need to be developed and built in about six months,” says Richard Zhang, Deputy Head of R&D of Product Development at GF Casting Solutions China. “We need to deliver in only half of the time we would normally have.” That means many busy weeks – but Zhang says GF’s strong R&D capabilities and production capacity have enabled the company to meet even the tightest schedules, giving the company a clear advantage in China’s commercial vehicle market.
“I’ve worked on multiple projects with GF, and it is definitely one of the most reliable suppliers I’ve seen,” says Feng Shi, a 30-year veteran at Sinotruk and currently the lead buyer of casting parts. “GF provides us with strong R&D support and machining expertise. We have built a very trusting relationship.”
According to Richard Zhang, that trust is hard-earned. The initial contact with Sinotruk was made in 2012, and the cooperation started gradually, initially with smaller projects. “They wondered if we could deliver new, original designs, not just improvements on the old ones – and we did,” Zhang says.
The breakthrough in innovations. 
The partnership reached new heights when Sinotruk asked GF to design the new assembly bracket for its flagship truck Howo-T7H in 2017. “Through structural optimization, mold flow and casting technology analysis, we provided Sinotruk with a new part that weights 25 percent less,” says Ethan Tian, Account Manager at GF Casting Solutions. The success helped lay a solid foundation for future cooperation. More than a dozen new products are currently in the development pipeline, Tian adds.
Looking ahead, both Tian and Zhang see tremendous opportunities to increase GF’s collaboration with other commercial vehicle manufacturers: “We have the technological foundation, and we are moving very quickly to enable our customers to shape future industry trends,” Tian says. Lightweight components from GF Casting Solutions will continue to contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions worldwide, helping transform the mobility sector for many years to come.
“At Sinotruk, they wondered if we could impress them with original designs – and we did.”

Two Points of View. 
Why does China’s commercial vehicle market hold great potential for GF Casting Solutions?
China has committed to reaching its carbon emission peak by 2030, which means cutting emissions is a must for industries across the board. Demand for cleaner and more economical trucks will spike in the coming years and GF is in a great position to capture that growth. Some years ago, Chinese truck makers were asked by the government to make their products lighter. Not only to reduce emissions, but also because of highway fees. For instance, due to strict limits for overloading, GF’s innovative and lightweight design for casting solutions additionally helps the truck owners to avoid possible fees related to weight.
Richard Zhang:
Which challenges do you see in this market and how are you tackling them?
First, you need to earn customers trust, then you need to be flexible and react quickly to customers’ needs. China is a fast-moving market, meaning that our internal system has to get the job done quicker, without compromising on process and quality.
Richard Zhang:
Why did Sinotruk choose GF Casting Solutions as its supplier?
GF has a global reputation. Its state-of-the-art. 
R&D capabilities can greatly help us with forwardlooking lightweight designs. It’s also a very dedicated partner that we can rely on in challenging scenarios.
Feng Shi:
What has impressed you the most about GF during your cooperation?
We know GF is a global brand with a very long history and mature management system. However, what impressed me the most is how agile and flexible the GF team is when it comes to finding innovative solutions within tight deadlines. It highlights how GF always puts the focus on the customer.
Feng Shi: “I’ve been working on multiple projects with GF, and it is definitely one of the most reliable suppliers I’ve seen.”

About Schaeffler. 
GF and Schaeffler have a rich history and a shared commitment to innovation and sustainability, underscored by GF’s Strategy 2025 and Schaeffler’s Roadmap 2025. The family company headquartered in Herzogenaurach (Germany), about 200 kilometers north of Munich, employs around 84’000 people worldwide. With its technologies and services for CO2-efficient drives, electromobility, Industry 4.0, digitalization, and renewable energies, Schaeffler is working to make mobility more efficient, more intelligent, and more sustainable.
The sci-fi movie “Back to the Future” came out almost 40 years ago, but it has by no means lost its cult status. The very final scene in particular is now legendary: “Roads? Where we’re going, we don’t need roads,” says Doc Brown as he and Marty McFly lift off. A couple of mid-air fiery streaks later and the two time travelers find themselves in the future. It’s 2015 and the skyscape is full of flying cars.
Is this pure fiction? Not quite.
Our reality today has little to do with what we once thought the future would look like. While our cars remain on the ground rather than flying, the world is looking for ways to replace fossil fuels and make mobility more environmentally friendly. However, what the film showed back then and what we now know for sure is that internal combustion engines have had their day. The future is most likely electric, among other alternative forms of propulsion, and low-CO2.

A green light for a new culture 2021 marked the start of the new strategy cycle. With the , GF also unveiled its vision to become a sustainability and innovation leader providing superior customer value. The Strategy 2025 focuses on three strategic areas:
Strategy 2025 ▪ Driving profitable growth ▪ Increasing robustness ▪ Evolving into a performance and learning culture. 
Employees are set to play a leading role in the realization of this five-year roadmap. To achieve this, GF is establishing a culture of performance and learning by setting up a number of initiatives. One of the highlights during the year was the largest-ever hybrid town hall meeting, which kicked off the Culture Movement at the end of November. Around 3’000 employees from around the globe joined corporate management for the online event and shared their questions and thoughts on GF values.
The new corporate culture is a means to encourage all employees to shape the future together and implement the Strategy 2025 according to our . The GF culture is strongly focused on building highly efficient teams, creating a caring environment, and encouraging learning to unleash the full potential of our employees for speed and excellence. The Culture Movement includes all employees at all seniority levels and strives to anchor these new corporate values in their daily activities. This objective is to be achieved in two ways. The first is through a range of communication initiatives and a multi-day leadership training course for upper management that is geared towards the new culture. The second is from the ground up, as every individual employee takes on an active role in the change process. Selected employees are working as “change agents” to help convey the new values and behaviors to their local teams.

Standardization of HR processes. 
In the previous strategy cycle, GF began to put in place digital solutions that are aimed at standardizing and modernizing strategic HR processes. As part of this new platform, HR successfully launched a new process for internal training that combines seminars such as 4DX, 7 Habits, and the GF Academy offering. In the future, company-wide training, including online and offline training, will be held on this learning platform.
A focus on personal responsibility. 
Employees’ personal responsibility has become more and more important in recent years and this trend will continue in the future. At GF, employees can take their development into their own hands. They are supported by a range of programs and processes such as the Talent Management initiative that kicked off in 2021. The aim of this initiative is to motivate employees to take the next big step in their careers at GF. In this way, the company wants to foster the commitment of employees and hopes to discover those talents who are looking to learn and advance on their own initiative.
An attractive environment. 
As a progressive employer with a focus on sustainability and innovation, GF strives to promote a team-oriented corporate culture. This also includes employment conditions that are in line with the market. In the reporting year, the company carried out a large-scale study aimed at helping it to consolidate its position as an attractive employer. This will now serve as the basis for new and modernized employer branding. With measures such as participation in job and student fairs, an open day for schools, and apprentice exchanges between divisions, GF presents itself as an attractive and forward-looking company. Furthermore, the company is cooperating with universities and advanced technical colleges around the world to attract new talent.

Annual Report 2021. 
New ways of working, new generations of talent. 
Younger generations bring with them a new understanding of work in terms of qualifications and work styles, as well as their expectations of their employer. Achieving a basis of trust for fruitful cooperation between different generations of employees requires new ways of thinking and greater flexibility, while at the same time enabling younger employees and more experienced staff to benefit from one another. GF strives to foster this mutual learning, among others in the form of diverse mentoring and coaching processes.
Promoting employees. 
GF has been training apprentices in technical and commercial professions for over 100 years. This dual education system approach is pursued at its Swiss, German, and Austrian locations, as well as in the US. Alongside the talent search at universities and colleges, this model is an important instrument for promoting our own young talent over the long term and for familiarizing young people with the corporate culture at an early stage. Dual training is one of the significant strengths of the Swiss economy, which is why GF is expanding the Swiss model of apprenticeship to other global locations.
Well-trained employees are a competitive advantage. 
The training and ongoing professional and personal development of employees are of high importance. The GF Academy offers broad internal training and development opportunities that help every employee to grow in their careers. A centralized learning platform enables employees to learn flexibly from and with each other. Moreover, thanks to its many locations around the world, GF can help talented employees gain experience abroad, which is always a formative step in their development.

In addition, special attention is being paid to succession planning for, and the development and promotion of, female employees. The regular exchanges with the two Board members, Eveline Saupper and Jasmin Staiblin, which are open to all interested employees, have been especially well received. A further sign of evolution is the nomination of from Japan to the Board of Directors. This nomination was made on the basis of her international experience and extensive competence in the fields of digitalization, sustainability, and governance. Furthermore, the expanded regulations for remote working, which were introduced in the summer of 2020 and permitted more flexible forms of work, met with broad approval.

76


Annual Report 2021. 
Much of GF’s business success relies on understanding the needs of its stakeholders. The following chapter lists these main stakeholder groups, their significance to GF, and the formats through which it maintains this dialogue.
Employees. 
GF’s more than 15’000 employees in 34 countries are crucial for the business’s success, as GF can only make progress through their work, motivation, and commitment. They are GF’s source of success and continually challenge the company to deliver the most sustainable solutions.
GF maintains a continuous dialogue with its employees and believes it is essential to engage with them in implementing the Strategy 2025. GF has therefore developed a framework for an even more positive and inclusive corporate culture. This is designed to support the achievement of the goals outlined in the strategy and unlock each employee’s full potential and that of the entire organization. GF communicates the new values of the corporate culture to employees as part of the Culture Movement process. Via this initiative, GF will bring these values to life and integrate them into employees’ daily work. Further information on the Culture Movement can be found in the chapter . Employees. 
In addition, each division conducts employee satisfaction surveys. In 2022, GF is planning a group-wide survey that will cover all three divisions and will include questions regarding the Strategy 2025 and the Culture Movement.

Communities and NGOs. 
GF supports and promotes cultural and social programs in its local communities. More generally, it aspires to enrich lives and create a positive overall impact. Within GF’s corporate citizenship programs, which help to improve access to drinking water and education, the company also cooperates with many different NGOs.
GF’s Clean Water Foundation supports projects focused on improving water filtration and distribution infrastructure in rural communities and hospitals. One of its main partners is Caritas Switzerland. In 2021, this partnership concluded phase III of a long-term project in Bolivia to improve access to clean and safe drinking water. In phase III, the partners installed 18 drinking water systems in 10 different communities to the direct benefit of over 700 families. GF has supported these projects with some CHF 500’000 in funds.
Another trusted partner of the foundation is Water Mission, a non-profit organization in the US. To support Water Mission’s fight against the global water crisis, GF hosts global “Walk for Water” fundraisers. During these events, participants walk approximately 1.5 miles to the midway point holding empty buckets, which they must fill with dirty water and carry another 1.5 miles to the finish line. The walk allows participants to experience the same day-to-day challenge as the 2.2 billion people worldwide that live without access to safe drinking water. In 2021, GF Piping Systems hosted a “Walk for Water” event in Irvine, California. Together with its sponsors, the 220 participants raised USD 150’000 for Water Mission. This effort alone will provide more than 6’000 people with clean water for the rest of their lives.

Sustainability Framework 2025 81


Annual Report 2021. 
In 2021, the Board of Directors made sustainability a strategic focus. In this context, GF’s management developed an implementation roadmap for the strategy period 2025. In addition to strengthening the organizational structure at the corporate and divisional levels, this roadmap entails the launch of several strategic sustainability initiatives.
Sustainability governance. 
GF believes that sustainability and business are very closely linked. Therefore, in line with the growing importance of sustainability in its business activities, GF declared 2021 “the year of sustainability”. The strategic priority of sustainability in the company is reflected in GF’s governance structure and overall approach to sustainability management.
The ultimate responsibility for sustainability at GF lies with the In 2020, GF formed a to support the Board of Directors in strengthening its focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) topics. The Sustainability Committee is embedded in the Nomination Committee. The Charter of the Nomination and Sustainability Committee defines that regular meetings must be held at least twice a year. In 2021, the committee met on three occasions. The committee’s agenda mainly focuses on GF’s sustainability initiatives (such as the implementation of the EU Taxonomy, the SBTi, or the TCFD disclosures) and GF’s eight sustainability goals for 2025. GF’s overall progress is measured against a predetermined timeline and the strategy cycle of 2025.
Board of Directors.
Sustainability Committee. 
The Sustainability Committee also has the essential role of ensuring that executive remuneration is linked to ESG targets and aligns with the eight goals of GF’s Sustainability Framework 2025. As a result, each Executive Committee member has GF’s company-wide CO2e target as a remuneration incentive. In addition, they also have individual targets such as the zero-accidents campaign, circular economy benchmarks, or the target to implement the TCFD’s recommendations and publish GF’s first TCFD report in March 2022 as part of its Annual Report.
The has a direct overview of GF’s progress on reaching the strategic goals and targets. In addition, the Executive Committee conducts performance reviews between two and four times per year and within each division’s management meetings. These reviews enable the Executive Committee to take the required strategic and operational actions to ensure GF’s target achievement remains on track.
Executive Committee. 
For the roll-out of the Sustainability Framework 2025, GF established a at the Executive Committee level. The CSC coordinates and steers all sustainability-related activities. It is headed by the. 
Corporate Sustainability Council (CSC) 82


Annual Report 2021. 
CSC Chairwoman, who advises the Executive Committee. The CSC consists of the CEO, CFO, Divisional Presidents, corporate and divisional sustainability teams, and high-level members of management. The CSC’s key responsibilities include the reporting and tracking of progress and measures regarding the Sustainability Framework 2025; supporting the Executive Committee on deciding on cross-divisional strategic sustainability projects and initiatives; coordinating and supervising projects and initiatives, and reporting their progress to the Executive Committee. The CSC meets at least twice every year. The council’s first meeting took place on 4 October 2021, where it exchanged ideas regarding: ▪ How to reduce GF’s CO2e emissions by committing to the SBTi (Science Based Targets initiative), implementing energy-saving measures, and purchasing renewable energy.

In addition, GF’s divisions also presented insights into their innovations, progress, and strategies in the area of sustainability. From 2022 onwards, the CSC is expected to meet twice a year with the possibility of additional meetings as required.
Each department and division is responsible for continuously integrating aspects of sustainability into GF’s daily operations towards achieving the Sustainability Targets 2025. The topic is coordinated at the corporate level by the The CST is positioned within the Corporate Finance organization and led by the. 
Head of Investor Relations & Sustainability. The Head of Sustainability Transformation leads key strategic, crossfunctional sustainability-related projects and initiatives. The Head of Corporate Sustainability participates in the Sustainability Committee meetings and is a member of the Corporate Risk Council. He is responsible for sustainability reporting, including engagement with ESG rating agencies. Both the Head of Sustainability Transformation and the Head of Corporate Sustainability report directly to the Head of Investor Relations and Sustainability.
Corporate Sustainability Team (CST).
The CST works in close contact with the three divisions’ dedicated sustainability teams to track the progress of individual locations, business units, and divisions towards achieving set targets. The CST is also responsible for raising organizational awareness about sustainability and climate-related risks.
The units evaluate their sustainability performance each quarter and present their respective management teams with the results. The sustainability units review the following aspects: the achievement of sustainability targets and the implementation status of agreed-upon actions, the monitoring of GF’s business partners’ sustainability performance and the development and marketing of products and solutions that provide GF’s customers with sustainability benefits.
divisional sustainability. 
Every year, the divisions determine a set of actions needed to implement the Corporation’s sustainability targets. Each divisional sustainability manager ensures their locations define and submit initiatives to meet the set goals, aggregates an overview for their division to track progress, and coordinates with the CST on status, cross-divisional experience-sharing, and, where needed, dispute escalation. For example, in 2021, GF Machining Solutions established a divisional sustainability working group that meets every quarter and brings together key functions and the divisional management team to define the next steps towards target achievement.
GF incentivizes corporate target achievement at various levels. For example, individual goals are defined for the Executive Committee members as well as for the corporate and divisional sustainability teams.
Communication on sustainability. 
To help embed sustainability aspects into GF’s daily business, the CST and the divisional sustainability teams communicate with GF employees through various channels. The next global GF sustainability conference will be held in 2022. To reflect GF’s increased focus on sustainability, the scope of the conference will be extended to include a more diverse audience that represents GF’s global operations. In 2022, the conference will focus on developing a 83


Annual Report 2021 concept that unites all relevant functions and departments in contributing to the strategic goals of the Sustainability Framework 2025.
Additionally, the CST worked closely with the divisional teams to organize employee workshops on the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and diversity and inclusion.
Updates on strategic sustainability initiatives. 
GF continuously monitors international sustainability developments to ensure it integrates relevant issues into its business decisions and processes. In 2021, GF made significant progress regarding science-based targets, the circular economy, climate-related financial disclosures, and the EU Taxonomy.
Science-based targets. 
In line with the 2015 Paris Agreement, governments and businesses are working to find practical and effective solutions to significantly limit global warming. Recently, the reinforced the urgent need to reduce global warming to 1.5°C (as opposed to well below 2°C) above preindustrial levels. To reach this goal, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has calculated that the world must halve annual greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.
IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report 1
1 Emissions Gap Report 2021 | UNEP – UN Environment Programme. 
GF firmly believes it has a responsibility to contribute to meeting these goals. It therefore uses the official protocols of the and is committed to setting a science-based target aligned with the 1.5°C ambition level across all three scopes. In 2021, GF made significant progress: firstly, it comprehensively recorded all emissions for scopes 1, 2, and 3. Across the 15 categories of Scope 3 emissions, GF identified four specific categories as material: purchased goods and services, upstream energy, upstream transport, and the use of sold products. The emissions from these four categories represent approximately 90% of GF’s total Scope 3 emissions.
Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) 84


Annual Report 2021. 
GF’s GHG emissions per Scope % of total emissions 100%
Scope 1 emissions (fuel-related energy consumption): 4%
Scope 2 emissions (electricity consumption): 14%
Scope 3 emissions (external to GF operations): 82%
Secondly, GF identified reduction potentials and targets for its emission scopes across all three divisions. In this context, GF conducted several cross-divisional and cross-functional workshops and interviews with site managers to establish emission-reduction pathways aligned with the SBTi. In this process, GF determined the reduction potential of energy efficiency measures, purchasing renewable electricity, and switching to lowcarbon suppliers and materials.
GF found the majority of its GHG emissions are Scope 3 emissions created either by suppliers during their manufacturing processes or by customers when using GF’s products or solutions. Only a mere 18% of the total GHG emissions are directly emitted by GF.
GF will submit the targets determined in this process by March to the SBTi. Once it has validated these targets, the SBTi is expected to make an official announcement by May 2022. GF is looking forward to officially joining the according to the protocols of the SBTi. GF’s commitment to the SBTi is an important step on the company’s path towards net zero.
group of companies taking action. 
Circular economy as a path to net zero. 
GF believes it is vital to ensure responsible resource and waste management. It is therefore working to redesign its production processes, find new materials, and create new business cases to close material loops. In addition, reducing waste during the manufacture of GF’s products has always been in focus. GF recognizes the concept of a circular economy is an important driver towards achieving a carbon-free economy.
In 2021, GF initiated a circular economy project featuring a series of workshops where a cross-divisional and crossfunctional team, including GF’s CFO, developed a common understanding of the approach and concepts to promote its adoption. The team also defined new pilot projects. These projects include new business models, modularity improvements, and product simplification to enable reuse within the material cycle. GF will implement these projects throughout 2022 and beyond.
EU Taxonomy for sustainable activities. 
The European Commission has set climate and energy targets for 2030 underpinned by an action plan – – to make the EU economy climate-neutral by 2050. The Commission considers direct investments in sustainable projects and activities as essential for reaching these targets. Therefore, in June 2020, the EU issued the , a framework that defines the specific types of economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable.

EU Taxonomy Regulation. 
In 2021, GF assessed its business activities against the developed EU Taxonomy criteria. The review of eligible activities has been completed for the environmental objectives regarding climate mitigation and climate adaptation. In 2022, we will extend the assessment to the remaining four environmental objectives.

Annual Report 2021. 
Guidance of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. 
It has become evident that climate change will have both immediate and long-term impacts on businesses around the world. GF firmly believes that companies that fail to recognize climate-related risks and opportunities and adjust their operations accordingly will ultimately become less competitive. In addition, as more investors become sensitive to the financial impact of climate change on businesses, these companies will also find it harder to access capital.
The (TCFD) issued a set of recommendations in 2017 to increase the transparency of how companies are addressing climate change. The TCFD’s purpose is to help companies provide meaningful climate-related disclosures so that investors can make more informed investment decisions.
Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. 
In 2021, a key component of GF’s TCFD-aligned risk management strategy was a scenario analysis assessing GF’s possible climate-related impacts between now and 2050. As a result, GF defined material physical and transition risks and opportunities as a foundation for future risk management, as well as various adaptation and mitigation activities.
With its first index published in 2022, GF is reflecting on the TCFD’s growing importance among investors and businesses. GF’s TCFD report emphasizes three critical topics: the climate-related opportunities that can help GF remain competitive, the specific physical risks GF is exposed to, and the transition risks facing GF’s operations. Full information on GF’s climate-related disclosures can be found in GF’s first . TCFD report. 
GF engages in sustainability efforts throughout the value chain and is committed to extending its sustainability standards to its suppliers. As one of its 2025 sustainability targets, GF aims to assess 80% of its procurement spend, which covers around 1’000 suppliers. GF partnered with the rating agency EcoVadis to conduct these assessments, focusing on the four themes of environment, labor and human rights, ethics, and sustainable procurement. Each assessment is adapted based on company size, industry, and country.
In 2021, GF’s responsible procurement team conducted an initial pilot phase to familiarize itself with the process. In September, it started the internal risk assessment and selected key suppliers and those with high risks to be included in the first assessment phase. In the follow-up, approximately 400 suppliers were invited to take part in the assessment. A kick-off webinar accompanied the broader roll-out to provide further details about the program and general sustainability issues in the supply chain.

Sustainability in GF’s own operations. 
In GF’s core business, sustainability efforts are directly linked to the Corporation’s understanding of its purpose – to add value to and improve the quality of lives through all of GF’s business endeavors. Thus, GF ensures that the components or complete-system solutions that it designs and produces address the megatrends faced by today’s society, contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and provide best value-added from a quality, safety, and sustainability perspective for the customers.
GF has set a target in its to generate 70% of its sales by 2025 from products, systems, or solutions that have social or environmental benefits. This objective guides the innovation efforts of all three divisions and the strategic alignment of their product portfolios.
Sustainability Framework 2025. 
For GF Piping Systems, this means ensuring the leakfree and safe transport of water, gas, and chemicals, delivering solutions that contribute to its customers’ decarbonization goals, and supporting its customers’ environmental efforts by increasing their efficiency during the installation and operation of GF’s systems. An example that provides significant savings in CO2 emissions is the recently developed Butterfly Valve 565. The valve optimizes piping systems built for water applications and can be used in a wide range of applications. The plastic valve is 60% lighter than conventional metal valves, thus reducing the energy and resources needed for transport and installation. The valve’s high-quality plastics also protect it from corrosion and abrasion, guaranteeing reduced maintenance and a longer lifespan.
For GF Casting Solutions, sustainability in its product portfolio means developing solutions for the future of mobility. For the division’s customers in the automotive segment, the development of alternative drive systems plays a critical role in reducing CO2 emissions. Using fewer and lighter components lowers a vehicle’s weight and is one of the most effective ways to reduce its fuel or energy consumption and emissions during its lifespan. GF Casting Solutions is partnering with Microsoft Switzerland in an innovation project using artificial intelligence to optimize the ramp-up phase of casting production and ultimately maximize the quality of components while minimizing their associated energy consumption. In 2021, the project was successfully tested at one of GF’s locations in Europe. In the next step, the project will extend to other plants.
For GF Machining Solutions, sustainability translates into more innovative, integrated, and connected high-precision machines and solutions. It is the division’s goal to ensure resource efficiency throughout the machine’s life cycle and to significantly reduce the energy consumption of its machines. The division also offers new technologies, such as laser texturing, to replace the harmful etching process. Offering re-use possibilities is equally important when it comes to sustainable manufacturing. In 2021, GF Machining Solutions took a step forward in reducing the environmental footprint of its products. In collaboration with a partner, the division designed a new “Ecospool” that can be produced with significantly less plastic. In addition, this spool is made of fully recyclable white Polystyrene plastic, allowing new spools to be created from used ones. By choosing a mono-material design and simplifying the recycling process, GF Machining Solutions is making circular economy principles a reality.

GF not only promotes sustainability within its own company, but also enters into partnerships with other companies to develop or implement sustainable projects together.
Collaboration with the Helsinki region. 
GF Piping Systems collaborates with the Helsinki Region Environmental Services Authority (HSY). The authority is responsible for wastewater treatment in the Helsinki region and manages around 3’000 km of water supply piping and 4’900 km of sewers. The city of Helsinki has the ambition to become the world’s most sustainable urban region. As part of this goal, HSY has begun replacing its metal pipelines with polyethylene pipes over the last ten years.
GF Piping Systems is supporting HSY to reach this ambitious goal. It supplies HSY with fittings for plastic piping networks from the ELGEF Plus system that are used in the water supply. For the collaboration with HSY, it was decisive that GFPS was the only supplier that could provide a comprehensive breakdown of CO2 emissions during the entire manufacturing and supply process.
In addition, the lightweight and corrosion-free ELGEF Plus components provide high flexibility in construction and low maintenance in operations. GFPS’s large-diameter piping joints are also leak-proof, ensuring water supply security and minimizing repair costs. GF is therefore HSY’s preferred partner to support the utility’s ongoing sustainability efforts.

GF Piping Systems joins Sustainable Digital Infrastructure Alliance (SDIA)
GF Piping Systems, the leading flow solutions provider for the safe and sustainable transport of fluids, has become a Sustainable Digital Infrastructure Alliance (SDIA) partner. The company joined the SDIA to partner with its association of companies, individuals, and governments to highlight the importance of digital infrastructure facilities contributing to reducing the global carbon footprint.
Data centers consumed about 205 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity in 2018, up 6% from 2010 ( ). That is slightly more electricity than what Denmark used in 2018 ( ), , an energy and climate change policy think tank, estimated that 43% of that is used for cooling. Therefore, any small improvement in efficiency can have significant environmental benefits. The SDIA is researching the development of advanced cooling systems using liquid- and air-cooling technologies to improve the overall efficiency of data centers. The cooling systems will be connected to district heating and cooling grids, using GF Piping Systems’ technology, to ensure energy recovery from the heat generated by IT equipment. As a global leader in flow solutions, GF Piping Systems’ high-quality and value-adding piping technologies will contribute to the project’s success.

Annual Report 2021. 
Dear readers,
Climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy create both opportunities and risks for companies like GF. We believe we can overcome these challenges by making the right investments in sustainable innovations and R&D to prepare GF for the future.
Over the course of 2021, GF embarked on a number of sustainability initiatives that directly address these issues. In addition, we have not only committed to setting a science-based target to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions aligned with the 1.5°C climate goal, but also launched our Sustainability Strategy for the next five years. GF’s Sustainability Framework, with its three focus areas, is fully embedded in our Strategy 2025. We observe an increasing demand for sustainable products and solutions and believe GF is well positioned to serve these market needs.
The TCFD report highlights three key topics: the climaterelated opportunities we should take to remain competitive, the specific kinds of physical risks GF is exposed to, and the transition risks faced by our operations.
This report used the TCFD recommendations as a framework and then went one step further by quantifying all material physical risks. GF’s next TCFD report will quantify its transition risks and opportunities – which we have already identified in this report – and provide updates on the strategic responses selected and the progress made in GF’s sustainability initiatives.

Governance 1.1 Describe the board’s oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities. 
GF believes sustainability is a topic of critical importance. Therefore, in 2020, GF formed a Sustainability Committee – a part of the Nomination and Sustainability Committee – to support the Board of Directors in executing their role of strengthening the focus on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) topics. The Charter of the Nomination and Sustainability Committee defines that regular meetings are held at least twice a year. In 2021, the committee met three times to discuss climate-related issues. The agenda explicitly refers to GF’s eight sustainability goals for 2025, which include climate change. Since 2020, climate change has been discussed in every meeting. GF’s overall progress is monitored against a predefined timeline and the strategy cycle of 2021-2025.
An essential role of the Sustainability Committee is to ensure that executive remuneration is linked to ESG targets and aligns with the eight goals of GF’s Sustainability Framework 2025. Accordingly, each Executive Committee member has the company-wide CO2e target as a remuneration incentive and a target to implement the recommendations of the TCFD and publish GF’s first TCFD report in March 2022 as part of the company’s annual report.
The Executive Committee has direct oversight over the progress made towards the strategic goals and targets, including those that are climate-related. In addition, the Executive Committee conducts performance reviews on a regular basis (two to four times a year) and within the management meetings of each division. These reviews enable the Executive Committee to take the necessary strategic and operational actions that ensure target achievement remains on track.
The Board of Directors declared Sustainability as the strategic topic of the year 2021. For the rollout of the Sustainability Framework 2025, a Corporate Sustainability Council (CSC) was established on Executive Committee level. The CSC coordinates and steers all activities relating to sustainability. It is headed by the CSC Chairwoman, advises the Executive Committee and consists of the CEO, CFO, Divisional Presidents, corporate and divisional sustainability teams and other members of GF’s top management. The key responsibilities of the CSC include the reporting and tracking of the progress and measures with regards to the Sustainability Framework 2025; supporting the Executive Committee with decisions on cross-divisional, strategic sustainability projects and initiatives; the coordination and supervision of the projects and initiatives and the reporting of the progress of the projects and initiatives to the Executive Committee. The CSC meets at least biannually.

Each department and division is responsible for continuously integrating sustainability aspects (including climate change) into GF’s daily operations to achieve the targets of the Sustainability Framework 2025. The topic is coordinated at the corporate level by the Corporate Sustainability Team (CST). The CST is positioned within the CFO’s organization and is led by the Head of Investor Relations & Sustainability. The Head Sustainability Transformation is the Chairwoman of the CSC with responsibility to lead key strategic, cross-functional sustainability-related projects and initiatives. The Head Corporate Sustainability is responsible for sustainability reporting, including the engagement with ESG rating agencies and is a member of the Sustainability Committee and Corporate Risk Council. Both the Head Sustainability Transformation and the Head Corporate Sustainability are reporting to the Head of Investor Relations & Sustainability.
94


Annual Report 2021. 
The CST works in close contact with the dedicated sustainability teams within the three divisions to ensure the tracking of progress of individual locations, business units towards achieving set targets. The CST is responsible for raising awareness in the organization on sustainability and, as part of that, climate-related risks.
The divisional sustainability units evaluate the sustainability performance every quarter and present their findings to their respective management teams. The following aspects are reviewed: the achievement of sustainability targets and the implementation status of agreed-upon actions, the monitoring of the sustainability performance of business partners, and the development and marketing of products and solutions offering sustainability benefits to GF customers.
The divisions define a set of measures each year to implement the sustainability targets adopted by the Corporation. Each divisional sustainability manager is responsible for ensuring the individual locations define and put forward required measures to meet the set goals, compiles an aggregated overview for their division to track progress, and coordinates with the CST on status, experience-sharing across divisions and, where needed, for escalation.
Corporate target achievement – including achievement of sustainability-related ones such as the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions – is incentivized at various levels. For example, for the Executive Committee members, individual goals are defined as well as for the corporate and divisional sustainability teams.

Annual Report 2021. 
Strategy 2.1 Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium, and long term. 
GF has identified hazards in categories relevant to its business model and in the context of climate-related risks and opportunities. These risks include both acute and chronic physical risks, transition risks and opportunities.
Physical risks include tropical cyclones, sea level rise, river flooding, precipitation, fire, drought and heat. For more information, please refer to the in-depth analysis and conclusions drawn from this report.
Transition risks include GHG prices, the security of energy and processes, regulations and taxes, litigation, consumer preferences, the availability of capital, the energy transition and raw materials. More information is available in section 3.1.
Opportunities include transportation, production and distribution processes, recycling, low-emissions energy sources, the carbon market, growing consumer demand, the diversification of business activities, availability of capital and substitutes for existing resources. More information is available in section 3.1.
For further information, see:
CDP Climate Change Questionnaire, GF, C2.2a 2.2 Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization’s businesses, strategy, and financial planning. 
GF’s product portfolio is dedicated to delivering solutions that help customers mitigate their climate impacts. GF has significant opportunities in all three divisions as changing consumer preferences and growing investor pressure require their product portfolios to become more energy-efficient and sustainable. We provide our customers with sustainable products and enter new markets with increased demand for sustainable alternatives.
Across its diverse product portfolio and operations, GF procures the majority of its raw materials, goods and services locally. This procurement policy is a pre-emptive measure to ensure our raw material deliveries reduce the impact of intercontinental distribution networks, while recognizing the consequences of these activities and the effect that a changing climate may have on the supply chain. In addition, GF’s manufacturing sites are in close proximity to their customers and strive to constantly optimize their logistics footprints, such as the two new Chinese factories in Shenyang (GFCS) and Yangzhou (GFPS).
The GF Code for Business Partners, which defines and monitors strict adherence to environmental, social and compliance practices bind GF suppliers across all three divisions. At the same time, GF heavily relies on the timely delivery of raw materials, goods and services. Acute physical risks, such as heavy rain, wildfires or floods can lead to the destruction of necessary infrastructure that hinders transportation and risks creating product supply shortages.
GF is committed to delivering solutions that help customers mitigate their contribution to climate change or build resilience and adaptation to it, driven by a core focus on product innovation and R&D. Therefore, GF invests in R&D to create innovative new products and solutions that provide environmental, climate and social benefits for its customers during the product’s use phase. In 2021, GF’s overall R&D budget was CHF 112 million. GF’s Sustainability Report 2020 describes how these investments translate into climate-related opportunities on pages 24 to 42.

Annual Report 2021 2.3 Describe the resilience of the organization’s strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C or lower scenario. 
The resilience of GF’s future strategy is affected by the transition to a low-carbon economy which presents both opportunities and risks. Therefore, GF has analyzed a range of climate scenarios that show possible outcomes under different climatic conditions. To project a scenario aligned with the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to 2°C or a lower scenario, the International Energy Agency’s (IEA’s) Sustainable Development Scenario was used. It analyzes various factors that could impact GF’s future business strategy and its ability to achieve longterm profitability.
Furthermore, to assess GF’s exposure to physical risks, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC’s) representative concentration pathways (RCP) was used in a business-as-usual scenario (RCP 4.5) and a 4°C scenario (RCP 8.5) until 2050. In the analysis, 2050 was used as a reference year in line with the Paris Agreement’s 2050 target for net-zero emissions. The Sustainability Committee made an explicit decision not to use climate scenarios beyond 2050.
In-depth analysis: Physical climate risks. 
This climate risk analysis was prepared using the “Climate Change Edition” of the “Location Risk Intelligence” software from reinsurer Munich Re. It was found that physical risks such as tropical cyclones and sea level rise were deemed immaterial to GF’s operations, whereas river flooding and precipitation posed a high risk to some operations. The percentages below refer to the share of GF’s global production sites that are exposed to a specific risk category.
Undefended River Flood. 
Undefended river flood describes the risk of flooding in areas where no flood protection systems or defense structures (such as dams) are in place. Under a 4°C scenario in 2050, the share of high-risk flood sites increases from 21% today to 28%. River flood is a particularly strong hazard in the Chinese sites of all divisions.
97


Annual Report 2021. 
Precipitation Stress Index. 
Due to global warming and rising ocean temperatures, air contains more moisture, which leads to an increase in heavy precipitation events. Heavy rainfall increases the risk of floods, which often lead to the destruction of infrastructure. The share of high-risk sites for heavy rain increases from 24% in 2021 to 28% in 2050, with a strong impact projected on sites in China, Switzerland and the United States.
Fire Weather Stress Index. 
Wildfires are destructive hazards that can occur naturally or be caused by humans. Fires destroy vegetation and lead to the destruction of infrastructure and economic resources. No GF sites fall into the high-risk category, but the share of medium-to-high risk sites at GF increases from 12% today to 19% in 2050 under a 4°C scenario. All other sites face only minor hazards.
98


Annual Report 2021. 
Drought Stress Index. 
Increasing temperatures combined with changes in precipitation patterns could cause drier weather conditions and more frequent and intense droughts that have severe economic, environmental and social impacts. Bakersfield (US) was identified as the only high-risk site for drought, but the number of medium-risk sites increases from 12% today to 31% in 2050 under a 4°C scenario.
Heat Stress Index. 
Global warming leads to increasing temperatures and more intense and frequent heatwaves. Heat stress affects humans, infrastructure and ecosystems. In 2021, only 3% of GF sites are in the high-risk range, but this increases to 10% in 2050 under a 4°C scenario. GF’s projections show heat stress is of particular significance for Chinese sites in all divisions.
99


Annual Report 2021. 
Risk Management 3.1 Describe the organization’s processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks. 
Risks identified at GF are based on a biannual risk mapping analysis and assessed for their likelihood of occurrence and potential impacts. Where possible and appropriate, the consequences of the identified risks are quantitatively evaluated, taking into consideration the frequency of consequences and any mitigation measures already implemented (alternatively, a qualitative assessment of the risk exposure is applied). As a result, the risk consequences are classified in terms of their potential financial cost to the business: ▪ minor (less than CHF 3 million), ▪ major (between CHF 3 million and CHF 15 million), ▪ critical (between CHF 15 million and CHF 75 million) and ▪ catastrophic (more than CHF 75 million).
GF determines the potential overall impact of identified risks by combining their likelihood of occurrence with their potential financial consequences and factoring in any other relevant concerns, such as reputational damages or legal impacts. Substantive impacts are evaluated based on a tiered system of threshold values, depending on the risk scope. Risks at the corporate, division and site levels are each attributed different sets of thresholds as the sites vary in size.
In general, an impact is considered substantive in the following cases: ▪ the intersection of catastrophic with possible, probable or likely, ▪ the intersection between critical and probable or likely, and ▪ the intersection of major with likely.
In 2021, GF conducted a workshop with experts from all three divisions, Corporate Risk Management and Corporate Sustainability to define the main climate-related risks and opportunities and assess their possible impacts. On the one hand, GF considered impacts on its business activities that could result from the physical effects of climate change and transition risks such as political, technological, market and reputational developments. On the other hand, GF derived relevant climate-related opportunities resulting from resource efficiencies, energy sources, products and services, and market demands.

Annual Report 2021. 
Transition risk Impact on GF Significance for GF. 
GHG price Increasing energy and electricity usage costs decrease GF’s competitiveness.
The potential costs of GF’s carbon-neutral transition are being considered due to the diverse locations of production sites and operating in different regulatory markets.
Security of energy supply and prices Fluctuations in energy prices and abrupt and unexpected shifts in energy costs.
GF's business is energy-intensive and consequently energy costs are critical. Although energy price fluctuations are normal, sustained higher prices will challenge GF's competitiveness.
Regulations and taxes Regulations on limits for GHG emissions and/or higher taxes on energy sources such as nonrenewable electricity or fuels.
Energy efficiency standards are already commonplace in all countries where GF has operations. However, it is anticipated that standards will continue to become stricter in the future.
Litigation Involvement in litigations may result in higher costs and reputational damage.
GF can be involved in litigation at times, especially through its production sites. Climaterelated litigation is expected to increase, thus increasing GF's risk exposure.
Consumer preferences Changes in demand, especially in products considered “unsustainable”.
As a B2B manufacturer, GF's demand originates from changing demand in various markets, such as currently observed in the automotive industry’s transition from internal combustion engines to e-mobility.
Reduced capital availability Due to the requirements of the EU Taxonomy, the availability of capital is becoming increasingly dependent on a company’s climate performance.
GF's product portfolio will be screened for eligibility to the EU Taxonomy to indicate its contribution to the six environmental objectives, identify the share of turnover contributing to socially or environmentally beneficial activities and how much of GF’s operating expenses are devoted to it.
Energy transition Research and development expenditures in new and alternative low-carbon technologies.
One-quarter of GF's business is energy-intensive and requires a variety of energy sources to function. Switching to renewable energy will amount to a Capex investment of over MCHF 52 over the next five years to transition to lowercarbon energy sources.
Raw materials Fluctuations in raw material prices as well as abrupt and unexpected shifts in raw material costs lead to unreliable supply chains.
As a manufacturer, shifts in raw materials are a high risk for GF that can impact supply chain stability. The increasing costs and scarcity of some raw materials may pose a risk to all three GF divisions.
Low-emissions sources of energy Additional costs for buying renewable electricity. In 2020, renewable energy met 17% of GF's total energy consumption. Substituting electricity from fossil fuels with renewable sources will be a high priority for GF in the coming years, which in turn will increase operating costs.
101


Annual Report 2021. 
Opportunity Impact on GF Significance for GF. 
Modes of transportation Reduction of fuel consumption by replacing fleets with more fuel-efficient vehicles and using fuel-efficient modes of transport.
As a manufacturer, GF depends on reliable transportation. GF launched an e-mobility policy in 2021 to transition its car fleet to an electrified fleet while also utilizing subsidies in selected markets.
Production and distribution processes Efficiency gains in production processes and logistics.
As a manufacturer using heavy machinery for production, there are many opportunities for efficiency gains across all divisions. For example, GF identified several opportunities to make its production capacity more energyefficient by replacing extruders and molding machines with more economical units.
Recycling Purchase of alternative materials or reuse of existing materials.
GF is currently embarking on a circular economy program that identifies products reusing materials from other processes, such as biobased PVC. The program is currently being trialed in projects in the UK.
Low emissions energy sources Switching to renewable electricity and energy sources.
Low-emissions energy sources and renewable electricity leads to reduced exposure in fossil fuel markets.
Carbon market Participation in carbon market reduces exposure to GHG emissions.
Participation in carbon markets can reduce CO2 emissions and generate income when CO2 emissions are decreased.
Consumer preferences Attracting and retaining customers with preferences for low-emission products whilst gaining a competitive advantage.
Stronger demand for GF's sustainable products reflects consumers' low-emission preferences and leads to a more competitive market position, such as GF’s hydrogen shipping project in the Netherlands.
Ability to diversify business activities Establishing a foothold and expanding GF’s position in future-oriented markets for sustainable products.
The development of new products and services leads to a diversification of GF’s product portfolio and attracts new customer segments. Increasing demands for e-mobility products/lightweight products, new turbines and carbon blades diversify GF’s product portfolio.
Capital availability Demands from investors in line with the EU Taxonomy increases investment in companies with sustainable products.
The relevance of the EU taxonomy is expected to increase in the future. GF believes EU taxonomyaligned products will increase investment attractiveness and lead to increased capital availability.
Resource substitutes or diversification Increased supply chain reliability and the ability to maintain operation in various conditions.
The diversification of GF’s energy supply and the decentralization of its power generation increase supply chain reliability and improve flexibility in cases of natural disasters.
102


Annual Report 2021 3.2 Describe the organization’s processes for managing climate-related risks. 
GF employs various tools to manage internal and external risks, including those directly related to climate change. For example, the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) tool (Thomson Reuters Accelus) is used at the corporate and site/asset level in direct operations, as well as in the value chain, to assess specific upstream and downstream risks. The assessment includes systematic identification, evaluation and reporting on strategic, operational, financial, social, environmental and climate-related risks, in addition to maintaining comprehensive insurance coverage.
GF also identifies climate-related risks using the Munich Re tool, specifically regarding physical risk assessments. GF’s Corporate Sustainability Team also conducts independent research in cooperation with externally appointed consultants.
For further information, see:
CDP Climate Change Questionnaire, GF, C2.1b/C2.2 3.3 Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organization’s overall risk management. 
Climate-related risks are integrated into GF’s risk management system via its combined ERM process. The clear organization of climate activities and governance roles ensures that GF works efficiently and continuously improves. In the future, GF plans to further align the TCFD risk management process with its on-site risk management process to create a single approach for all risk categories. This consolidation will ensure the complete integration of climaterelated risks and opportunities into GF’s enterprise risk management system.
Metrics and Targets 4.1 Disclose the metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process. 
In October 2021, GF’s Corporate Sustainability Council approved a more ambitious science-based target aligned with the 1.5°C warming scenario. This decision aligns GF’s ambition level with the latest climate science and the IPCC’s recommendation.
As GF sets corporate targets over a five-year period, this means that a 21% reduction of absolute CO2e emissions will need to be reached by 2026, or 4.2% per year for scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. We will achieve this target by focusing on energy efficiency measures across all production sites, engaging power purchase agreements to hedge volatile renewable energy prices and procuring renewable energy certificates.
As GF’s scope 3 emissions are almost five times its scope 1 and 2 emissions combined, it also set a target at this level. Therefore, the second part of GF’s climate strategy aims to reduce scope 3 emissions by 2% per year as an intensity target with no absolute growth in emissions.
GF will reduce its scope 3 emissions by working closely with its suppliers to implement dedicated CO2e reduction measures and transition its energy portfolio to renewable energy. For GF’s customers, it is clear that GF’s product portfolio is advantageous as it provides numerous sustainable product offerings that can help them to lower their CO2e footprint. In addition, GF has set a target to have 70% of its portfolio deemed sustainable by 2025 from 58% in 2020. For GF Piping Systems, this target includes replacing raw materials with bio-based alternatives, deploying automated flow solutions to reduce non-revenue water and maintaining leakage-free piping systems for the safe transport of water, gases and chemicals. For GF Casting Solutions, the focus remains on manufacturing lightweight automotive components. For GF Machining Solutions, milling and EDM machines will become even more energyefficient and it will employ laser technology to replace hazardous chemical processes.
GF committed to setting a science-based target in November 2021 and plans to submit it to the science-based targets initiative (SBTi) in March 2022, with a validation expected within six weeks of the SBTi panel’s review.
103


Annual Report 2021. 
Energy efficiency measures were identified for all production sites and typically addressed replacing or retrofitting equipment in cases where it is possible to achieve energy reductions of up to 20%. Other measures include upgrades to heating, cooling and compressed air systems, the insulation of equipment and improving the energy consumption of buildings and production sites. GF has also placed a significant focus on installing solar panels on its sites and initial estimates project energy savings of around 2% to 5% for scope 2 CO2e emissions.
GF is also already working on setting a net-zero target to be achieved no later than 2050. GF’s net-zero roadmap will be aligned with the Net-Zero Standard that was released on 28 October, 2021 by the SBTi.
For further information, see:
Sustainability Report 2021, Sustainability management at GF (to be published in April 2022) 4.2 Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and their related risks. 
GF believes we must take great care to avoid potentially adverse environmental impacts and has identified “climate and energy” as one of its most relevant material topics. The scope of this focus includes reducing GHG emissions across the value chain and decreasing energy consumption throughout GF’s global operations. In practical terms, this means improving energy efficiency, promoting the use of renewable energy sources, evaluating measures to self-generate renewable energy on-site and procuring renewable energy certificates.
In 2021, GF increased the frequency of its sustainability reporting from annually to quarterly (internally only), and since October 2021, it has included specific references to its progress in reducing its CO2e footprint. GF’s quarterly reporting focuses on approximately 34 production sites responsible for over 90% of total CO2e emissions while applying the equity share approach.

Annual Report 2021. 
Scope 3 emissions data were calculated using a combination of methods for each category as prescribed by the GHG Protocol. For those categories that contribute most to emissions, primary supplier data were used whereas for those activities that contribute least to emissions, secondary data were used. For “purchased goods and services”, supplier specific data based on GHG inventory sources for raw materials were obtained. For the “use phase of sold products”, activity data were used based on the electricity consumed during operating hours for each type of machine.
For further information, see:
Sustainability Report 2021, GHG emissions (to be published in April 2022) 4.3 Describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets. 
Although GF has set its climate targets in absolute terms across all three scopes from 2021 onwards, its target in prior years consisted of a single intensity target based on production volumes for scopes 1 and 2.
Between 2015 and 2020, GF’s target was to reduce its operations’ GHG emissions intensity by 10% from 2016 to 2020. At the end of 2020, GF had exceeded this goal by 2%. Under its Sustainability Framework 2025, GF intends to reduce its absolute GHG footprint by 21% by 2025 for scope 1 and 2 emissions. A target for scope 3 emissions will be published in 2022. This target focuses on GF’s purchased goods and services and the use of sold products for GF Machining Solutions. These two categories represents 88% of GF’s scope 3 emissions.

Corporate Governance Report. 
Introduction by the Chairman of the Board of Directors 107 Annual Report 2021


Annual Report 2021. 
Dear Shareholders,
On behalf of the Board of Directors of GF, I am pleased to present the 2021 Corporate Governance Report.
Another year under COVID-19 influence. 
The successive waves of COVID-19 variants once again led to the introduction of home-office measures, where possible, as well as testing and mask mandates at most of our facilities around the world. Amid previously unheardof supply chain disruptions and price increases, especially for raw materials, tremendous efforts were made in all three divisions of GF to ensure we could continue to serve our customers while protecting the safety of our employees.
Board meetings were held online in the first half of 2021, however, in the second half of the year, it was possible to hold them in person again. The April 2021 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting also had to be organized without the physical presence of our shareholders. Dedicated channels were therefore established to allow shareholders to ask questions, which were answered in writing prior to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.
An intense and fruitful dialogue with our stakeholders. 
Around 20 governance discussions have been held with our investors and proxy advisors, mostly online, led by our Chairman and attended by our Independent Lead Director and our Head of Investor Relations / Sustainability.
The main topics discussed were sustainability, diversity, and the transparency of Board topics, as well as feedback on the actions taken in regards to previous years meetings.
Board refreshment and diversity. 
The skills of Board Members are individually disclosed in this Corporate Governance Report (see ). This serves as a basis for ongoing and future searches.
Diversity. 
As announced in October 2021, following a worldwide search commissioned by GF, Ms. Ayano Senaha, COO of Recruit Holdings Co., Ltd., will be proposed for election to our Board at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting in April 2022 (see ). CV of Ms. Ayano Senaha. 
Risk Management strengthened, including cybersecurity. 
The Board’s two-hour risk management workshop was held in November, and was followed up in December with measures on how to mitigate the risks that had been identified. The Audit Committee, which included cybersecurity in its charter, met several times to hear about and monitor the measures taken by our IT systems and cybersecurity experts, acknowledging the opportunities as well as the additional risks related to home-office and to digitalization.
More generally, the Board decided to extend the Audit Committee Charter to overall risk management in order to deepen this topic at the Board level.
Transparency of Boards processes/decisions. 
In 2021, the Board concluded its annual self-assessment, which showed a high degree of satisfaction with our Board culture of mutual trust, respect, and transparency. Despite COVID-19, it was possible to organize a week-long visit to our customers and GF facilities in the US, marking a highlight during a year that was strongly characterized by the pandemic.
The continuous monitoring of succession and talent management as well as a deep dive on innovation will be the key topics of 2022.
The Independent Lead Director held separate meetings with our CEO as well as with all Board Members without the presence of the Chairman and reported on the clear separation of roles and the smooth and respectful relationship enjoyed by the Chairman and CEO at GF.
Sustainability as the strategic Board topic of the year 2021. 
A week-long deep dive on this topic was organized in November during the Board’s visit to our US customers and GF facilities.
In particular, the integration of sustainability into GF’s strategy and business model were further deepened with clear goals/road maps for reducing CO emissions, enhancing diversity at all levels, and focusing our R&D efforts and investments towards products and services which contribute the most of both sustainability and economic value.

Annual Report 2021. 
In addition, three Nomination and Sustainability Committee Meetings with a focus on sustainability were held in 2021. At these meetings, GF’s first report according to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) was reviewed, the ESG (ESG = Environmental, Social, Governance) objectives of the Executive Committee were discussed and aligned, and the progress made on the company’s ESG goals was assessed. The application to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and commitment to set a 1.5°C target will be submitted in the first quarter of 2022. GF’s emissions and progress against these targets will be disclosed in the reporting for 2022.
We trust you will find this report interesting and informative, and look forward to continuing our fruitful dialogue.
Sincerely,
Yves Serra Chairman of the Board of Directors 109

Candidates are also interviewed by the Chairman and other Members of the Board of Directors personally before any nominations are proposed. The Nomination and Sustainability Committee makes a subsequent recommendation to the whole Board of Directors, which then decides who to propose for nomination to the shareholders at the forthcoming Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. The Head of Corporate HR provides support throughout the process.

Information and control instruments. 
The Board of Directors is informed in detail about business performance every month. The Members of the Board of Directors receive the monthly report. In addition to an introductory commentary on the current course of business, it contains the most important key figures for the course of business and the monthly closing as well as a preview of the next three months and the year-end. These key figures are broken down by GF Corporation, divisions, and GF Corporate Companies. The Executive Committee presents and comments on business performance and presents its 128


Annual Report 2021 assessment of business performance for the coming months at Board meetings. It also presents all important topics to the Board of Directors.
In addition, the Board of Directors regularly receives the forecast containing the expected figures at year-end. Once a year, the Board of Directors receives and approves the budget of the GF Corporation and the divisions for the following year. The Board of Directors holds as a general rule a two-day meeting once a year to discuss the strategies of the divisions and the GF Corporation as a whole. Once a year, it discusses the Corporate Risk Officer’s report and the GF Corporation’s risk profile, and is updated about the measures taken to minimize and control risk.
In mid-March 2020, GF introduced additional “COVID-19 Reporting” that included all corporate subsidiaries. Thanks to this additional data, the Executive Committee was promptly informed about the measures taken locally, the employee situation, and additional financial key figures (e.g. liquidity and sales). The CEO kept the Chairman of the Board of Directors informed of these findings on an ongoing basis. Similarly, the CEO reported to the full Board of Directors at ordinary and extraordinary meetings about the impact on operations and the measures taken, both in terms of employee safety and business aspects.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors receives the invitations and minutes of the Executive Committee and Corporate Staff Meetings. The development of the Sustainability Strategy 2025 provided the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors with an additional opportunity for in-depth discussions with management. Where circumstances allowed, the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors also visited several companies and customers. In 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with a GF Corporate Company in Switzerland and visited GF Corporate Companies and customers from all three divisions during a oneweek trip around the US.
Internal Audit. 
Internal Audit reports to the Chairman of the Audit Committee operationally and to the CFO administratively. Based on the audit plan approved by the Audit Committee, GF Corporate Companies are audited either annually or every two to five years, depending on the risk assessment and based on a comprehensive audit program. In the year under review, 49 internal audits were conducted. The audit reports are reconciled with the management of the audited GF Corporate Companies or responsible functions and distributed to the line managers, the external auditor, the Executive Committee, the Audit Committee, as well as the Chairman of the Board of Directors. Audit reports with significant findings are presented to and discussed in the Audit Committee.
Internal Audit ensures that all discrepancies arising in internal and external audits are addressed and submits a report to the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee. The Head of Internal Audit prepares an annual report, which is discussed by the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee. During the year, the Head of Internal Audit informs the Audit Committee of any changes to the audit plan and of the progress of planned audits. He also serves as the secretary of the Audit Committee.
Corporate Compliance. 
The Service Center Law & Compliance informs the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee about legal issues and significant changes to the law. The Corporate Compliance Officer (CCO) is appointed by the CEO and in this function reports to the General Counsel; he informs the CEO directly, if necessary. The CCO helps GF Corporate Companies comply with the law, internal directives, and the GF Corporation’s principles of business ethics in their business activities, in particular through preventative measures and training in the divisions along with information and advice to the GF Corporate Companies. The Executive Committee, in consultation with the CCO, defines priority issues. Furthermore, all GF employees have the possibility to report compliance violations also anonymously to the CCO. In line with the EU Directive on the protection of whistleblowers, an additional reporting channel was implemented in 2021, which complements existing systems. These reporting channels for anonymous reports are accessible to all GF employees and third parties.

Risk management. 
The Board of Directors and the Executive Committee attach great importance to the thorough handling of risks in the areas of strategy, finance, markets, management and resources, operations, and sustainability. The Head of the Service Center Risk Management & Tax acts as the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and, in this function, reports directly to the CEO. The CRO is supported in this task by a Risk Officer from each of the three divisions. Supplemented by internal experts of the corporate risk management, the risk officers under the leadership of the CRO constitute the Corporate Risk Council that met once during the year under review.
In addition, the CRO conducted workshops with the management of the three divisions as well as with the Executive Committee to analyze the risk situation, discuss measures to mitigate the risks, and define the actual top risks of each unit. The results of these discussions were presented to the Board of Directors during its risk management workshop in November 2021. The purpose of this workshop was also to define the main risks to the GF Corporation from the perspective of the Board of Directors and to compare these with the risk assessment of the Members of the Executive Committee. The outcome of this workshop and the measures adopted to reduce or control the risks were summarized in the Risk Report 2021, which was approved by the Board of Directors in December 2021.
More generally, the Board decided to extend the Audit Committee Charter to overall risk management in order to deepen this topic at the Board level.
The handling of financial and operational risks is explained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in note . 3.6 Risk management. 
Assessment of the Executive Committee. 
The Board of Directors evaluates and assesses the performance of the Executive Committee and its Members at least once a year in the absence of the Executive Committee Members.

Among other things, the strategy also focuses on several sustainability issues, including water scarcity and climate change. Another important event was an online town hall meeting at the end of November in which several thousand employees took part. The event focused on the further development of the corporate culture – one of three key focus areas as part of Strategy 2025.
The new corporate video showing GF in a fresh, new light was extremely well received, particularly on social media. The modernization of internal communication channels is also underway. A new communication platform will include an app and will replace the current intranet starting from the middle of 2022. The popular employee magazine “Globe”, which rated extremely highly in an internal reader survey, will be relaunched at the beginning of 2022.

Compensation Report. 
Introduction by the Chairwoman of the Compensation Committee 144 Annual Report 2021


Annual Report 2021. 
Dear Shareholders,
On behalf of the Board of Directors of GF and of the Compensation Committee, I am pleased to present the 2021 Compensation Report.
In the past two years, the Compensation Committee conducted a thorough review of the compensation system applicable to the Executive Committee. As announced in the 2020 Compensation Report, the changes to the shortterm- and long-term incentive plan of the Executive Committee were implemented in 2021. These changes were discussed in detail with investors and proxy advisors already in 2020 and were received very positively, which was also confirmed by the high approval rate of the Compensation Report at the last Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. In addition and to increase transparency, you will find a more detailed disclosure of the short-term incentive achievement as well as information about the vesting of the long-term incentive plans.
In 2021, the Compensation Committee reviewed the Board remuneration structure and levels. Based on the outcomes of this analysis, the Compensation Committee proposed to the Board of Directors to adjust the fees for the Board Chairmanship, for the Chairmanship of the Compensation Committee and for the Chairmanship of the Nomination & Sustainability Committee. The adjustments were approved by the Board of Directors and have been effective as of the 2021 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. Further details can be found in this Compensation Report.
While business in 2020 was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, in the year under review, the business in major market segments of the company recovered and remarkable progress was achieved toward the strategic targets. We will explain in this report how GF’s performance in 2021 impacted the compensation awarded to the members of the Executive Committee in the incentive plans.
This Compensation Report includes all relevant information concerning the compensation policy and programs, the governance around compensation decisions, and the compensation awarded in the reporting year. You will be asked to approve the maximum compensation amount for the Board of Directors for the period until the next Annual Shareholders’ Meeting and the maximum compensation amount for the Executive Committee for the next financial year (prospective binding votes) at this year’s Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. In addition, your valued opinion will be sought with regard to the Compensation Report through a consultative retrospective vote.
We trust that the adjustments made to the compensation system will help us to achieve the ambitious strategy and we thank you for your valuable feedback and your continued support. We are looking forward to continuing this constructive dialogue with you as our shareholders and stakeholders.
Sincerely,
Eveline Saupper Chairwoman of the Compensation Committee 145

On behalf of the Board of Directors, internal and external Auditors annually review the compliance of the compensation decisions made with the Articles of Association, the Organizational Rules and the compensation regulations for the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors.
The Compensation Committee regularly calls in external compensation specialists and consultants to obtain independent advice and/or benchmarking compensation data. In the year under review, Agnès Blust Consulting provided services related to Board of Directors and Executive Committee compensation matters. Obermatt was appointed to measure the relative performance of Georg Fischer for the purpose of the long-term incentive plan. These companies have no other mandates with GF.
Method used to determine compensation. 
Benchmarking. 
The compensation structure and levels of the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee are reviewed every two to three years and are tailored to the relevant sectors and labor markets in which GF competes for talent. For the purpose of comparison, the Compensation Committee relies on compensation surveys published by independent consulting firms and on publicly available information such as the compensation disclosures of comparable companies.
Comparable companies are defined as multinational industrial companies listed on the Swiss stock exchange (SIX) with a similar business model and size in terms of market capitalization, sales, number of employees, complexity, and geographic scope. The peer group for the compensation benchmark of the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee include the following Swiss companies: Bucher Industries, DKSH, Dormakaba, Geberit, OC Oerlikon, SIG Combibloc, Sonova, Straumann, Sulzer. The benchmarking on compensation was last conducted in 2021.
153


Annual Report 2021. 
Performance management. 
The Compensation Committee also takes into consideration effective business and individual performance while determining the compensation amounts to be paid to the CEO and to the other Members of the Executive Committee. Individual performance is assessed through the annual Management By Objectives (MBO) process, where individual objectives are defined at the beginning of the year and the achievement against those objectives is evaluated at the end of the year. The objective setting and the performance assessment of the Members of the Executive Committee are conducted by the CEO and by the Chairman of the Board for the CEO. The performance assessment of the CEO and the other Members of the Executive Committee is reviewed by the Compensation Committee.

In order to ensure their independence in exercising their supervisory duties, the Members of the Board of Directors receive fixed compensation only. The compensation is paid partially in cash and partially in shares blocked for a period of five years in order to closely align their compensation with shareholders’ interests.

The compensation applicable to the Board of Directors is reviewed every two to three years based on competitive market practice and its basic structure is kept as constant as possible. The last benchmarking analysis was conducted in 2021 (please refer to section for details of the peer group). Based on the outcomes of this analysis, the Compensation Committee proposed to the Board of Directors to adjust the fees for the Board Chairmanship, for the Chairmanship of the Compensation Committee and for the Chairmanship of the Nomination & Sustainability Committee. The adjustments were approved by the Board of Directors and have been effective as of the 2021 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.

In order to guarantee the independence of the Members of the Board of Directors in executing their supervisory duties, their compensation is fixed and does not contain any performance-related component. The annual compensation for each Member of the Board of Directors depends on the functions and tasks carried out in the year under review and consists of an annual basis board fee paid in cash and in blocked shares, as well as additional committee fees paid in cash. The cash fees are paid in January for the previous calendar year, while the shares are allocated in December of the respective calendar year. The shares are blocked for a period of five years. The blocking period is lifted in the event of death or disability and remains in place in all other instances of termination. The shares are disclosed at their market value based on the closing share price on the last trading day of the reporting year.

For each business objective, the Board of Directors sets a target level and a threshold level (hurdle) of achievement under which there is no payout. A special focus is set on the sales target, as growth is a strong pillar of the strategy 2025. Furthermore, the ROIC target is set at a level clearly over the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of the Corporation in order to maximize value creation. The respective achievement level of each business objective is measured on a yearly basis and determines a payout factor for that business objective.
Sustainability objectives for the STI. 
Sustainability objectives are based on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria material to the company and its stakeholders. The Corporate sustainability targets are specifically reflected in the sustainability roadmaps of the divisions and are well represented in the objective setting of the Executive Committee.
The annual sustainability objectives are aligned with the targets 2025, which include for example: ▪ Product portfolio: 70% of sales with social or environmental benefits; ▪ Reduction of absolute CO2e emissions by 21% to limit global warming to 1.5°C for scope 1 and 2 emissions; ▪ Reduction of water intensity by 20% in high stress areas; ▪ Reduction of 20% of waste sent to landfill or incineration; ▪ Reduction of accident rate by 30% by continuing with the “Be Aware-Be Safe” campaign; ▪ Implementation of measures to increase diversity and inclusion.
Individual objectives for the STI. 
The individual objectives are set within the MBO process at the beginning of the year. These objectives are clearly measurable, not duplicating the financial targets, and are set in different categories: ▪ Non-financial strategic goals, such as acquisitions or portfolio adaptions; ▪ Operational goals, such as the implementation of digitalization projects, the successful launch of new products, implementation of corporate training initiatives, acquisition and integration of new technologies and services, development of new business segments, and expansion of production to new regions; ▪ Goals to promote the value and culture implementation according to the strategy of the company; ▪ Personal goals, such as personal improvement and/or training sessions and succession planning.
At the end of the year, the achievement of each individual objective is assessed, and this determines the payout factor for the portion of the STI related to individual objectives.
Weighting of the business, sustainability and individual objectives. 
Sustainability objectives are a separate element of the performance measurement accounting for 10% of the STI, and are not part of the individual objectives. Consequently, the individual objectives account for 25% of the STI.
The weighting of the business and individual objectives for the CEO and the other Members of the Executive Committee depends on the function (the highest weighting is allocated to the organization the individual is responsible for) and is described in the following table: 160

Annual Report 2021. 
Long-term incentive (share-based compensation)
In the context of the new strategy cycle 2021–2025 and further to the feedback received from investors and proxy advisors, the Compensation Committee undertook a detailed review of the long-term incentive (LTI) plan in 2020 and decided to amend the design of the plan as per the beginning of 2021. The amendments were announced in the Compensation Report 2020 and were received very positively in the discussions, which took place prior to the implementation, with investors and proxy advisors.
The purpose of the LTI plan is to: ▪ Align the interests of executives with those of GF’s shareholders; ▪ Allow executives to participate in the long-term success of GF; ▪ Foster and support a high-performance culture.
The LTI is a performance share (PS) plan. The CEO and the other Members of the Executive Committee are granted a number of PS annually based on a percentage of the annual fixed base salary. The target LTI amounts to 90% of the annual fixed base salary for the CEO and to 60% of the annual fixed base salary for the other Members of the Executive Committee. The number of PS granted corresponds to the target LTI amount divided by the average Georg Fischer share closing price of the last 60 trading days of the previous year. For financial year 2021, the PS were granted on 1 January 2021. The PS are subject to a three-year cliff vesting followed by an additional two-year blocking period on the vested shares.
The vesting of the PS is conditional upon the achievement of two specific performance objectives over a prospective period of three years: earnings per share (EPS) as an internal performance measure and relative total shareholder return (rTSR) as an external performance measure.
The number of PS granted is split as follows: ▪ 50% of the PS depend on the EPS performance (PS(EPS)); ▪ 50% of the PS depend on the rTSR performance (PS(rTSR)).

Vesting: 0% - 150% 1 ABS = Annual Fixed Base Salary. 
The EPS target, which is determined by the Board of Directors, is in line with the ambitious Strategy 2025 goals of GF and is measured at the end of the vesting period. Share buybacks, major acquisitions/divestitures, or capital increases are neutralized and have no impact on the EPS value calculation.
The rTSR is measured as a percentile rank in relation to a peer group. The peer group consists of the companies of the SMI MID index as these companies are comparable to GF in terms of organizational size, complexity, and market capitalization and the SMI MID index best reflects the economic environment for companies listed in Switzerland. The percentile rank is evaluated on an annual basis: at the end of the vesting period, the final ranking of GF among the peer group is the average annual ranking over the three-year vesting period.
For both performance measures, a threshold level of performance (hurdle), under which there is no vesting of the PS, is defined, as well as the target level, corresponding to a vesting level of 100% and a maximum achievement level, for which the vesting is capped at 150%.
Both EPS and rTSR, are measured individually; hence, the vesting of the PS(EPS) cannot be compensated by the vesting of PS(rTSR) and vice-versa.

Annual Report 2021. 
The vesting rules of the LTI plan are summarized in the table below:
Performance measure Earnings per share (EPS) Relative total shareholder return (rTSR)
Description EPS: (Average EPS value years x, x+1, x+2) divided by (Average EPS value years x-1, x-2, x-3)
TSR: starting value of volume-weighted average share price (VWAP) over the first 30 trading days of the year and ending value of the VWAP over the last 30 trading days of the year. Relativity measured as the average annual ranking within the peer group (companies of the SMI MID) over 3 years.
Rationale Internal measure Reflects GF’s profitability and how efficiently the strategy is implemented. 
External measure Reflects GF’s relative value compared to the SMI MID. 
Weighting 50% of the PS grant 50% of the PS grant. 
Target level 20% EPS growth over 3 years: 100% payout. 
Relative TSR at the median of the peer group: 100% payout. 
Maximum achievement level 150% 150%
Vesting period 3 years Followed by 2-year blocking period on vested shares 3 years Followed by 2-year blocking period on vested shares. 
Vesting rules Threshold: 0% EPS growth over 3 years = 50% vesting Target: 20% EPS growth over 3 years = 100% vesting Maximum: 30% EPS growth over 3 years = 150% vesting Linear interpolation in between EPS decline over 3 years: 0% payout. 
Threshold: 25th percentile = 50% vesting Target: 50th percentile = 100% vesting Maximum: 75th percentile = 150% vesting Linear interpolation between threshold/target and maximum. 
Vesting curve earnings per share (EPS) 163


Annual Report 2021. 
Vesting curve relative total shareholder return (rTSR)
The Compensation Committee is responsible for evaluating each year if extraordinary, one-time events have significantly influenced any of the performance objectives, EPS, and rTSR, and, if so, to make adjustment recommendations to the Board of Directors. The explanations for such adjustments, if any, will be included in the Compensation Report of the relevant year. For 2021, no adjustments were necessary.
In case of termination of employment during the vesting period, unvested PS are forfeited except in the following situations: termination of employment due to retirement, death, disability, involuntary termination by the employer other than for cause or behavior, change of control, in which cases unvested PS vest pro-rata based on the time period expired from the grant date until the termination date.
The vesting is accelerated to the termination date and is based on an estimated performance assessment, except in case of retirement or involuntary termination, in which case the vesting will occur at the regular vesting date based on the performance measurement for the entire performance period.
Vested shares remain blocked until the end of the respective blocking periods, except in the event of death, disability, or change of control, in which case the restriction period is immediately lifted.
The shares in the LTI plan are either treasury shares or repurchased on the market. No issuance of shares is foreseen for the LTI plan in order to avoid shareholder dilution.
Clawback and malus provisions. 
For the LTI, in the event a lower amount would have been awarded or paid out due to a misstatement of financial results or of fraudulent or willful substantial misconduct by a Member of the Executive Committee, the Board of Directors will review the specific facts and circumstances and take action. With regard to awards granted under the LTI in respect of the years for which a restatement has to be made and/or in which the misconduct took place, the Board of Directors may determine at any time before or after the delivery of the shares to forfeit or suspend the vesting of any LTI award in full or in part (malus), require the transfer for nil consideration of some or all the shares delivered under the LTI plan (clawback), and/or require a reimbursement in form of a cash payment in respect of some or all the shares delivered under the LTI plan (clawback).
The clawback and malus provisions apply to the Members of the Executive Committee for the entire duration of their membership and for up to three years following the termination thereof.
Benefits. 
Benefits consist primarily of retirement and insurance plans that are designed to provide a reasonable level of income in case of retirement as well as a reasonable level of protection against risks such as death and disability. All 164


Annual Report 2021. 
Members of the Executive Committee have a Swiss employment contract and participate in the pension fund of GF offered to all Swiss-based employees. The pension fund exceeds the minimum legal requirements of the Swiss Federal Law on Occupational Retirement, Survivors, and Disability Pension Plans (BVG) and is in line with commensurate market practice. In the case of top-management positions, including the Members of the Executive Committee, an early retirement plan is in place. The plan is entirely funded by the employer and is administered by a Swiss foundation. Beneficiaries may opt for early retirement from the age of 60. Regular retirement is at the age 65.
Members of the Executive Management do not receive special benefits. They are entitled to a lump sum representation allowance and to reimbursement of business expenses in accordance with the expense rules applicable to all employees at management levels employed in Switzerland. The expense regulation has been approved by the relevant cantonal tax authorities.
Contractual terms. 
The employment contracts with the CEO and the other Members of the Executive Committee foresee a notice period of a maximum of twelve months. There are no entitlements to severance payments, nor any change of control provisions, other than the early vesting and early unblocking of share awards as disclosed in the section ). Their contracts may foresee non-competition provisions that are limited in time to a maximum of two years and which allow compensation up to a maximum of the last total annual compensation paid.
Long-term incentive (share-based compensation. 
Shareholding ownership guideline. 
The CEO and the other Members of the Executive Committee are required to hold a minimum percentage of annual base salary in GF shares.
Newly appointed members must build up the required ownership within five years of their appointment. In the event of a substantial rise or drop in the share price, the Board of Directors may at its discretion amend that time period accordingly.
The minimum holding requirements are illustrated in the table below:
Shareholding ownership requirement Build-up period. 
CEO 200% of annual fixed base salary 5 years. 
Other Members of the Executive Committee 100% of annual fixed base salary 5 years. 
To calculate whether the minimum holding requirement is met, all vested shares are considered regardless of whether they are blocked or not. Unvested PS are excluded. The Compensation Committee reviews compliance with the share ownership guideline on an annual basis.

Annual Report 2021 5 Other benefits represent employer contributions to social insurance funds.
6 The total compensation includes the cash compensation (basis and committee fees), the share-based compensation and the contribution to social insurance funds.
7 The amounts in the Total compensation 2020 column include a temporary reduction in cash compensation implemented in 2020 in order to contribute to a solidarity fund of the GF Corporation intended to mitigate hardship caused by short-time work due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The total compensation paid to the Board of Directors in 2021 was higher compared with the previous year. This change was due to the following factors: ▪ Although the number of board members declined by one compared to the previous year, the increase in the value of the shares (CHF 1’385.00 on 31 December 2021 compared with CHF 1’140.00 on 31 December 2020) and the increase of the fees for the Board Chairmanship and for the Chairmanship of the Compensation Committee, which has been based on a benchmark analysis among the defined peer group, resulted in a higher compensation overall; ▪ In 2020, the cash compensation was temporarily reduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Except for the adjustment to the fees for the Board Chairmanship, for the Chairmanship of the Compensation Committee, and for the Chairmanship of the Nomination & Sustainability Committee, the compensation system for the Board of Directors was unchanged compared with the previous year.
At the 2020 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, shareholders approved a maximum aggregate compensation amount of CHF 3.450 million (based on a share value of CHF 1’600.00) for the Board of Directors for the compensation period from the 2020 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting until the 2021 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. For this period, the effective compensation amounted to CHF 2.767 million (based on a share value of CHF 1’140.00 for the period in 2020 and CHF 1’385.00 for the period in 2021), and is thus within the approved limits.
At the 2021 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, shareholders approved a maximum aggregate compensation amount of CHF 3.140 million for the Board of Directors for the compensation period from the 2021 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting until the 2022 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. This compensation period has therefore not yet been completed, and a conclusive assessment will be provided in the 2022 Compensation Report.
In the reporting year, no further compensation was paid to Members of the Board of Directors and no compensation was paid to parties closely related to Members of the Board of Directors.
Executive Committee. 
The Members of the Executive Committee received cash, share-based compensation, and social security and pension contributions amounting to CHF 8.697 million for the year under review (previous year: CHF 7.415 million), compared with a total amount of CHF 10.531 million approved by the shareholders at the 2020 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.
Under the LTI plan, 1’988 performance shares with a total value at grant of CHF 2.055 million were granted to Members of the Executive Committee for the year under review (previous year: 1’764 performance shares with a total value of CHF 1.977 million).

Compensation for Ivan Filisetti was not for the full financial year 2020, as he was promoted to the Executive Committee on 1 July 2020.
7 Highest individual compensation.
The total compensation for the CEO and the other Members of the Executive Committee in 2021 was higher than in 2020. The change in the compensation was due to the following factors: ▪ Fixed base salary: The fixed base salaries of the CEO and Members of the Executive Committee were increased in line with market practice and the result of the benchmark analysis conducted in 2021. When comparing 2021 and 2020, it should be noted that a temporary reduction in fixed salary in 2020 was implemented in order to contribute to a solidarity fund of the GF Corporation intended to mitigate hardship caused by short-time work due to the COVID-19 pandemic; ▪ STI: The financial performance of the Corporation and the divisions was higher in 2021 compared with 2020, which resulted in a higher STI payout (see details in the section ). For the year under review, the STI payout for the CEO was CHF 1’146’000 (STI for the CEO in 2020 was CHF 540’000) and CHF 2’674’000 for the Executive Committee (incl. CEO). The overall payout for the Executive Committee is based on target achievements in the range from 84% to 136.5% (49% to 96% in 2020);
Performance in 2021 ▪ LTI: The overall value of the share-based remuneration increased from last year, which resulted from the change in the grant value mechanism of the new LTI plan design, implemented as per January 2021; ▪ Please note that a significant portion of the social security payments of the employer to the Swiss social security system represents a solidarity payment, as the individuals will never get any return or benefit due to these payments.
The ratio between fixed and awarded variable compensation in 2021 was as follows: 170

Short-term incentive – Sustainability. 
Sustainability measures have been implemented very successfully in 2021 and the organization has made significant progress on the roadmap to achieve its long-term targets.
For example, absolute reduction measures in line with science-based targets have been defined for Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions for production sites globally and the achievement will now be measured over the course of the next five years. Such measures include switching to renewable energy, replacing old machines with energy efficient ones, heat recovery for processing aluminum, and adopting a bio-based product portfolio.
The roll-out of the “Be Aware – Be Safe” campaign is already showing initial signs of success, as the company continued to have no work-related fatalities.
GF’s global operations have been assessed according to TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures). The TCFD report quantifies GF’s exposure to physical risks such as rising sea levels, severe drought, heavy precipitation, etc, and identifies major transition risks and opportunities.
The achievement of the individual sustainability objectives ranged from 115% to 140% of target.

Annual Report 2021. 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
Information to the report. 
This section explains the basis for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and provides a summary of the main general accounting principles as well as management assumptions and estimates.
Basis for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. 
The consolidated financial statements of Georg Fischer Ltd (GF) have been prepared in accordance with all of the current guidelines of the Accounting and Reporting Recommendations (Swiss GAAP FER) and, furthermore, with the provisions of the Listing Rules of SIX Exchange Regulation and with Swiss company law. The consolidated financial statements are based on the financial statements of GF and all GF Corporate Companies for the year ended 31 December, prepared in accordance with uniform corporate accounting principles.
Due to rounding, numbers presented throughout the consolidated financial statements may not add up precisely to the totals provided. All ratios, percentages and variances are calculated using the underlying amount rather than the presented rounded amount. A value of 0 represents an amount rounded to 0. A blank value represents an actual value of 0.
Accounting principles. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost method with the exception of marketable securities and derivative financial instruments, which are measured at actual value.
Changes in accounting principles. 
In the year under review, the Swiss GAAP FER accounting principles remained unchanged.
Scope and principles of consolidation. 
The scope of consolidation includes GF and all GF Corporate Companies, which GF controls directly or indirectly by either holding more than 50% of the voting rights or by otherwise having the power to control their operating and financial policies (GF and these GF Corporate Companies are also collectively referred to as the GF Corporation). These GF Corporate Companies are fully consolidated; assets, liabilities, income, and expenses are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. Minority interests are presented as a component of consolidated equity in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated net income in the consolidated income statement. Gains arising from intercompany transactions are eliminated in full. Capital consolidation is based on the purchase method, whereby the acquisition cost of a GF Corporate Company is eliminated at the time of acquisition against the fair value of net assets acquired, with the remainder recorded as goodwill that is subsequently offset against the consolidated equity. In the event of an increase in ownership in a GF Corporate Company, any difference between the purchase price and the acquired equity is recognized as goodwill.
Joint ventures in which the GF Corporation exercises joint control together with a joint venture partner are proportionately consolidated.
181


Annual Report 2021. 
Companies in which GF has a minority interest of at least 20% but less than 50%, or over which it otherwise has significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method and included in the consolidated financial statements as investments in associates. Investments with less than 20% voting rights are accounted for at actual value and presented under other financial assets.
Foreign currencies. 
GF Corporate Companies prepare their financial statements in their functional currency. Assets and liabilities held in other currencies are converted at the spot rate on the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from transactions and from the conversion of balance sheet items into the functional currency are reported in the income statement.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in Swiss francs. For consolidation purposes, the financial statements of the GF Corporate Companies that report in another currency than Swiss francs are translated into Swiss francs as follows: balance sheets at year-end rates, income and cash flow statements at average rates for the year under review. Any translation differences resulting from the different translation of the balance sheets and income statements or from the translation of corporate loans with equity character denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in equity, including deferred tax. Upon the divestment of a foreign GF Corporate Company, the related cumulative translation differences are recycled to the income statement.
Other valuation principles. 
Other relevant valuation principles, if relevant for the understanding of the valuation of the respective asset or liability, are reflected in the notes.
Management assumptions and estimates. 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities at the balance sheet date. If in the future such estimates and assumptions, which are based on management’s best judgment at the balance sheet date, deviate from the actual circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the year in which the circumstances change. Management has identified the following assumptions and estimates to be of special relevance to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements:

Valuation of income taxes 1.6. 
Recoverability of property, plant, and equipment 2.6. 
Recoverability of goodwill 2.8.

Accounting principles revenue recognition. 
Billings for goods and services are recognized as sales when they are delivered or when the principal risks and rewards incidental to ownership are transferred. An assessment as to whether the principal risks and rewards were transferred for a particular delivery is made separately for each sales transaction on the basis of the contractual agreement underlying the transaction. The transfer of legal ownership alone does not necessarily result in the transfer of the principal risks and rewards. This is the case, for instance, if: ▪ the recipient of the delivery makes a claim against insufficient quality of the delivered item that exceeds a normal warranty claim ▪ the receipt of the proceeds depends on the resale of the goods by the buyer ▪ the installation of the goods at the recipient is an essential part of the contract ▪ the buyer has the right to return the item for a contractually specified reason and the likelihood of such a return cannot be assessed with any certainty. 
Services rendered are recognized as sales depending on the degree of their completion if the result of the service can be reliably assessed. Sales are stated before value-added tax, sales tax, and after the deduction of discounts and credits. Appropriate warranty provisions are recognized for anticipated claims.
187


Annual Report 2021. 
Accounting principles segment reporting. 
In accordance with the management structure and the reporting to the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors, the divisions represent the reportable segments. Segment accounting is prepared up to the level of operating result (EBIT), as this is the key figure used for management purposes. All operating assets and liabilities that are directly attributable or can be allocated on a reasonable basis to the segments are reported in the corresponding divisions. Customer segments manufacture similar products with comparable production processes and supply them to similar customer groups using similar distribution methods.

Annual Report 2021 and a fixed number of GF restricted shares. The valuation of the restricted shares of CHF 1.7 million (previous year: CHF 1.6 million) is based on the year-end share price of CHF 1’385 (previous year: CHF 1’140).

Expenses for share-based payment to Members of the Executive Committee and Members of the Senior Management amounted to CHF 8.1 million (previous year: CHF 7.2 million) and are recognized as personnel expenses. Thereof CHF 0.9 million (previous year: CHF 1.4 million) were recognized for 1’988 performance shares (previous year: 1’764) granted to Members of the Executive Committee as long-term share-based incentive (LTI). The LTI had a grant value of CHF 2.1 million (previous year: CHF 1.4 million).
Accounting principles. 
The compensation for the Executive Committee consists of a fixed base salary, a short-term cash incentive, and a long-term share-based incentive (LTI) and is recognized as personnel expenses. In 2021, the LTI was revised. The revised LTI is based on a grant value corresponding to a percentage of the base salary per member, which at the beginning of the period is translated into a specific number of future subscription rights in the form of Performance Shares (PS). The PS are subject to a three-year vesting period. The vesting is further conditional on the achievement of non-market conditions (diluted earnings per share target) as well as market conditions (relative shareholder return target). Depending on the level of target achievement, the PS will be settled in shares of GF at a conversion rate of between 50% (threshold) and 150% (maximum payout). If the threshold is not met, no settlement will take place. After vesting, vested PS are blocked for additional two years. The current cost of the LTI at grant date is determined by applying a Monte Carlo simulation. Anticipated dividends are included in the model. Subsequent to the grant date, non-market conditions are remeasured at each reporting date. Adjustments from the remeasurement are recognized prospectively. Market conditions are already included in the calculation of actual value at the time they are granted and no subsequent revaluation is done. The expenses for PS are recognized over the three-year vesting period as salaries and wages against other retained earnings. Additional information on the functionality of the LTI plan is provided in the . Compensation Report. 
The payments under share-based compensation for Senior Management are reported as personnel expenses. Costs are recognized fully in the year in which service is rendered.
Entitlements to state compensation programs at the level of individual GF Corporate Companies due to the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are reported under salaries and wages.

Effective income tax rate in % 21 22 1 The GF Corporation operates worldwide and is subject to income tax in many different tax jurisdictions. The effect of income taxed at different rates may vary from year to year due to varying results of the individual GF Corporate Companies and changes in local tax rates.
The table shows the main elements that cause the GF Corporation’s effective tax rate to differ from the statutory tax rate. The statutory tax rate is the ordinary tax rate applicable in the canton of Schaffhausen in Switzerland, where GF Corporation is headquartered. The above reconciliation starts with the statutory tax rate as it provides more meaningful information than a weighted average tax rate.
The decrease in the effective income tax rate was mainly due to the fact that the effective income tax rate in the previous year was influenced by tax losses at individual GF Corporate Companies due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which were not fully capitalized.
The unrecognized tax loss carryforwards in 2021 totaling CHF 141 million (previous year: CHF 159 million) have a potential tax relief effect of CHF 34 million (previous year: CHF 41 million), of which CHF 93 million (previous year: CHF 113 million) can be utilized for an indefinite period. CHF 1 million is to expire within one year (previous year: CHF 4 million).
190


Annual Report 2021. 
As of 31 December 2021, tax loss carryforwards of CHF 46 million (previous year: CHF 51 million) were capitalized, resulting in a deferred tax asset of CHF 11 million (previous year: CHF 12 million).
Management assumptions and estimates. 
Current tax liabilities are calculated based on an interpretation of the tax regulations in place in the relevant countries. The adequacy of such an interpretation is assessed by the tax authorities in the course of the final assessment or tax audits. This can result in material changes to tax expense. Furthermore, in order to determine whether tax loss carryforwards may be capitalized, it is necessary to critically assess the probability of future taxable profits that can be offset. This assessment depends on a variety of influencing factors and developments.
Accounting principles. 
Income taxes include current and deferred taxes. Current income taxes are calculated on the taxable profit. Deferred taxes are calculated by applying the balance sheet liability method for any temporary difference between the carrying amount according to Swiss GAAP FER and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Tax loss carryforwards are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits or deferred tax liabilities will be available against which they can be offset. The calculation of deferred taxes is based on the country-specific tax rates.

Annual Report 2021. 
The individual value adjustments amounted to CHF 5 million (previous year: CHF 6 million). It is expected that part of the underlying receivables will be paid. Receivables not due are mainly receivables arising from long lasting customer relationships. Based on experience, GF does not anticipate any significant defaults. For further information on credit management and trade accounts receivable, see . note 3.6 Risk management. 
Accounting principles. 
Accounts receivable are stated at nominal value. Value adjustments for doubtful accounts are established based on maturity structure and identifiable solvency risks. Besides individual value adjustments with respect to specific known risks, other value adjustments are recognized based on historical experience of default risk.

Accounting principles. 
Goods held for trading are generally stated at average cost and internally manufactured products at standard cost, including direct labor and materials used, as well as a commensurate share of the related overhead costs. Cash discount deductions are treated as reductions in the purchase cost. If the net realizable value is lower than the above, a corresponding valuation adjustment is made. Inventories with an insufficient turnover rate are partly or fully value-adjusted.

The movements in “Changes in scope of consolidation” under “Accumulated depreciation” result from the ownership increase of Langfang Shuchang Auto Parts Co Ltd and Beijing Jingran Lingyun Gas Equipment Co Ltd.
note 4.1. 
Changes in scope of consolidation. 
Land includes CHF 4 million of undeveloped properties (previous year: CHF 4 million).
The overall movements in “Reclassifications” are explained by the reclassification of a building from property, plant, and equipment to investment properties in Werdohl (Germany), as well as demo machines earmarked for sale reclassified to inventories.
In the previous year, the sale of investment properties in Schaffhausen (Switzerland) was recorded as a disposal. The actual value of investment properties, as determined by internal assessments on the basis of capitalized and current market values, is CHF 117 million (previous year: CHF 98 million).
Impairments amounting to CHF 6 million related mostly to obsolescence of equipment due to phase-outs of product groups. In the previous year, impairments amounting to CHF 5 million related entirely to the relocation of production from Werdohl (Germany).
Management assumptions and estimates. 
The recoverability of property, plant, and equipment are reviewed whenever there are indications that their carrying amount may no longer be recoverable, due to changed circumstances or events. If such a situation arises, the recoverable amount is determined. It corresponds to the higher of the discounted value of expected future net cash flows and the expected net selling price. If the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, a corresponding impairment loss is recognized in the income statement. The main assumptions on which these measurements are based include growth rates, margins, and discount rates. The actual future cash flows can differ considerably from discounted projections.
Accounting principles. 
Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost or manufacturing cost less depreciation and impairment. The recoverability of property, plant, and equipment is reviewed at least once a year. If there is any indication of an impairment, an impairment test is performed immediately. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized in the income statement. Financing costs of assets under construction are part of the costs of the asset if material. Assets held under finance lease contracts are capitalized at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments and fair value. The related outstanding finance lease obligations are presented as liabilities. Assets held under the terms of a finance lease are described in . Assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives or lease terms: note 3.4 Leasing ▪ Investment properties: 30–40 years ▪ Buildings: 30–40 years ▪ Building components: 8–20 years ▪ Machinery and production equipment: 6–20 years ▪ Other equipment (vehicles, IT systems, etc.): 1–5 years. 
Land and assets under construction are usually not depreciated. When components of larger assets have different useful lives, these are depreciated separately. Useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually on the balance sheet date and adjustments are recognized in the income statement. Any gains or losses on the disposal of items of property, plant, and equipment are recognized in the income statement.

Accounting principles. 
Land use rights are amortized on a straight-line basis over the duration of the usage rights granted. For this item, useful lives can be up to 50 years. Software is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of 1 to 5 years. Acquired royalties, patents, and similar rights are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 3 to 15 years. The recoverability of intangible assets is reviewed at least once a year. If there is any indication of an impairment, an impairment test is performed immediately. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized in the income statement. All research costs are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they were incurred. Development costs are recognized as an asset only to the extent that the following specific recognition criteria are all met cumulatively: ▪ costs are clearly defined, clearly attributable to the product or process, and can be separately identified and measured reliably ▪ the technical feasibility can be demonstrated ▪ the company intends to produce and market the product or to use the process ▪ a market exists ▪ the required internal resources are available ▪ the amount recognized is covered by future cash flows 197

Annual Report 2021. 
Goodwill from acquisitions is offset against the consolidated equity at the acquisition date. The theoretical amortization is based on the straight-line method over the useful life of five years. The additions in 2021 are mainly attributable to the acquisitions of F.G.S. Brasil Indústria e Comércio Ltda. (CHF 31 million) and Oxford Flow Utility & Industries Ltd (CHF 9 million).
As of the balance sheet date no indications of impairment were found except for the goodwill of Global Supply Company LLC, Hallandale (USA), GF Casting Solutions SRL, Pitești (Romania), and Symmedia GmbH, Bielefeld (Germany). These goodwill items were tested for impairment. By applying the capital asset pricing model, individual costs of capital were calculated. The calculation required an assessment of the relative market risk of different peer groups as well as the determination of specific risk-free interest rates, equity market risk premiums, the borrowing costs, and relevant tax rates. Since the cash flow projections were based on cash flows after tax, the discount rate has also been determined after tax. The discount rates are for Global Supply Company LLC at 7.6%, for GF Casting Solutions SRL at 11.3%, and for Symmedia GmbH at 7.5%. The impairment tests for Global Supply Company LLC, GF Casting Solutions SRL, and Symmedia GmbH revealed that the resulting recoverable amounts based on value in use calculations exceeded the respective carrying amounts.
In 2020, the impairment tests for GF Urecon Ltd, Global Supply Company LLC, GF Casting Solutions SRL, and Symmedia GmbH revealed that the resulting recoverable amounts based on value in use calculations exceeded the respective carrying amounts. The impairment test for GF Precicast SA showed that the value of the goodwill was not fully supported by the calculated value in use. As a result, an impairment charge on the partial carrying amount of goodwill of CHF 21 million was recorded in the theoretical goodwill reconciliation. GF Precicast SA mainly serves the international aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets. The partial impairment of the goodwill was triggered by the strong decrease in demand for aircraft engine parts and the expectation of a delayed recovery in that market segment.
Management assumptions and estimates. 
For goodwill, an impairment test is performed if there is any indication that the theoretical book value is no longer recoverable. As a basis for the calculation, business plans for the next five years are used. The projections are based on knowledge and experience as well as on current judgments made by management as to the probable economic development of the relevant markets. It is assumed that there are no significant planned changes in the organization of any of the divisions, except for the measures already decided and announced.
Accounting principles. 
In the event of a business combination, goodwill as of the date of acquisition is calculated as follows: the acquisition price plus transaction costs incurred in connection with the business combination less the value of the acquired and revalued net assets on the balance sheet.
The positive or negative goodwill resulting from acquisitions and changes in ownership are offset in equity against retained earnings at the date of acquisition. Upon the disposal of a GF Corporate Company, the goodwill previously offset in equity is transferred to the income statement. If parts of the purchase price are dependent on future results, they are estimated as accurately as possible at the acquisition date and recognized in the balance sheet. In the event of disparities when the definitive purchase price is settled, the goodwill offset in equity is adjusted accordingly.
The recoverability of the goodwill reported in the theoretical movement table is reviewed at least once a year. If there is any indication of an impairment, an impairment test is performed immediately. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized. As the goodwill is already offset in equity at the date of the acquisition, an impairment of the goodwill does not affect the income statement, but leads to a disclosure in the notes only.

For employee benefits provided by pension funds refer to . note 5.1 Employee benefit obligations. 
Warranties. 
Cover expected expenses for warranty benefits such as repairs and replacements. All three divisions provide warranty benefits to their customers: 39% of the provisions relate to GF Piping Systems (previous year: 26%), 28% GF Casting Solutions (previous year: 44%), and 33% GF Machining Solutions (previous year: 30%).
Legal. 
Includes all obligations deriving from legal cases and litigations. None of the individual provisions should lead to an outflow of more than CHF 5 million (previous year: CHF 5 million).
Onerous contracts. 
Summarizes contracts for which the fulfillment leads to unavoidable costs that exceed the associated economic benefits.
Restructuring. 
Summarizes provisions for legal and/or constructive obligations deriving from restructurings. A constructive obligation arises when a detailed and formal plan for a restructuring exists and a legitimate expectation of third parties that the obligation will be fulfilled was raised. The changes in provision in 2021 and 2020 are related to restructuring and relocation activities in Europe.

Annual Report 2021. 
Other. 
Includes all other events that give rise to a provision such as non-warranty claims by customers and risks from business activities not allocated to the warranties, legal, or onerous contract categories.
Management assumptions and estimates. 
In the course of their ordinary operating activities, GF Corporate Companies can become involved in litigation. Provisions for pending legal proceedings are measured on the basis of professional expertise of internal and external lawyers and a best estimate of the expected outflow of resources (considering available insurance coverage). The assessment may change in the following year depending on the future development of ongoing legal proceedings. If there are any contractual obligations for which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations exceed the expected economic benefits (e.g. onerous contracts), provisions are made for the agreed amounts over the entire period or over a prudently estimated period.
Accounting principles. 
Provisions are recognized if a legal or constructive obligation exists as a result of a past event that makes it probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle this obligation and the amount can be estimated reliably. The valuation of provisions in all categories is based on actual data if available (e.g. claims that have occurred or been reported) or on the experience of recent years and management estimates. Possible obligations whose occurrence cannot be assessed on the balance sheet date or obligations whose amount cannot be reliably estimated are disclosed as contingent liabilities.

Contingent liabilities amounted to CHF 90 million (previous year: CHF 90 million) and include guarantees to third parties. In the previous year, GF sold all remaining interests in related parties. As a result, former guarantees to related parties in favor of third parties became guarantees to third parties. The amount of guarantees to former related parties in favor of third parties at year-end 2020 was CHF 86 million.

Annual Report 2021 3 Capital and financial risk management. 
Total capital is defined as total equity and net debt. The GF Corporation manages its capital structure in order to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, achieve an optimal cost of capital and optimize the long-term returns to its shareholders as well as provide financial flexibility with regard to future strategic investments. The GF Corporation is exposed to a number of financial risks, and this section further outlines the key financial risks and how they are managed.

Total 247 352 400 999 958 1 This category comprises other financial liabilities with a fixed interest period of more than three months.
Net debt, which is calculated as the difference between interest-bearing liabilities and cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, decreased by CHF 63 million to CHF 54 million in the year under review (previous year: CHF 117 million). This decrease was primarily related to the free cash flow (CHF 110 million) minus the dividend payments to GF shareholders and minority shareholders amounting to CHF 72 million.
In the previous year, the financial flexibility and maturity profile were improved by the placement of a CHF 200 million bond with a maturity of 9.5 years. Furthermore, short-term bank loans in the amount of CHF 435 million were drawn and repaid during the previous year.

The syndicated credit line provides the GF Corporation with the financial flexibility to act swiftly, for instance in the case of acquisitions, and was not drawn as of the end of the year 2021 and 2020. In addition to other terms, the syndicated credit line is subject to a covenant with respect to the net debt ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA). The conditions of the syndicated credit line are considered to represent standard conditions for such types of arrangements. As of 31 December 2021, the financial covenant was not breached.
The bonds as well as the syndicated credit line are subject to standard cross-default clauses, whereby the outstanding amounts may all become due if early repayment of another loan is demanded from GF or one of its subsidiaries, owing to a failure to meet the credit terms. As of the balance sheet date, the effective credit terms had been met.
The interest-bearing financial liabilities also included loans payable to employee benefit plans in the amount of CHF 2 million (previous year: CHF 3 million).

Annual Report 2021. 
Accounting principles. 
Financial liabilities comprise loans, bonds and finance lease contracts. They are recognized at their amortized cost. Borrowing costs are recognized in the income statement using the effective interest method. Borrowing costs that can be allocated directly to the construction, build-up, or purchase of a qualifying asset are capitalized as part of the acquisition or manufacturing costs of the asset.
3.2 Pledged or assigned assets. 
Assets pledged or restricted on title in part or whole amounted to CHF 8 million (previous year: CHF 9 million). They essentially contain CHF 5 million (previous year: CHF 5 million) of pledged assets related to accounts receivable and CHF 3 million (previous year: CHF 3 million) related to liquid assets. The assets are pledged or restricted on title as collateral for bank loans.

note 3.1 Interest-bearing financial liabilities. 
Accounting principles. 
Finance leases are recognized in property, plant, and equipment as well as in other financial liabilities on the balance sheet when most of the contractual risks and rewards have been transferred to the GF Corporate Company. Lease installments are divided into an interest and a repayment component based on the annuity method. Assets held under such finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful life and lease term. Operating lease installments are reported in the income statement under operating expenses.
3.5 Equity. 
Share capital. 
As of 31 December 2021, the share capital comprised 4’100’898 registered shares with a par value of CHF 1 each. Total dividend-bearing nominal capital amounted to CHF 4’100’898.
Until 14 April 2022, the maximum authorized share capital is CHF 400’000 divided into 400’000 registered shares, each with a par value of CHF 1. The conditional capital consists of a maximum of 400’000 shares divided into 400’000 registered shares, each with a par value of CHF 1. The maximum amount of the authorized or conditional capital is reduced by the amount of authorized or conditional capital created through the issue of bonds or similar debt instruments or new shares.
Dividend policy and dividend. 
The Board of Directors presents a proposal for the appropriation of retained earnings to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting of GF. Over the medium term, the target is to distribute between 30% and 40% of the consolidated net profit to shareholders.
For the financial year 2021 the Board of Directors is proposing to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting of GF a total dividend payment out of the retained earnings of CHF 20 per registered share (previous year: CHF 15 per registered share).

Accounting principles. 
Treasury shares are recorded at acquisition cost as a negative position in equity. Gains or losses arising from the disposal of treasury shares are added to or deducted from the capital reserves.
Target capital structure. 
The GF Corporation uses two ratios to monitor equity: the equity ratio and the return on equity. The equity ratio represents equity as a percentage of total assets. Return on equity is net profit expressed as a percentage of average equity. These ratios are reported to the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors on a regular basis.
2021 2020. 
Equity ratio as %, at 31.12. 39.7 40.3. 
Return on average reported equity as % 13.8 7.9. 
The GF Corporation aims to maintain an equity ratio of 35% to 40% with a return on equity above 15%. Although total equity increased, total assets increased, so that the equity ratio fell to 39.7% (previous year: 40.3%).

Annual Report 2021 3.6 Risk management. 
Enterprise risk management as a fully integrated risk management process was systematically applied in 2021 at all levels of the GF Corporation. A risk map was prepared in May for the GF Corporation, the three divisions, and all significant GF Corporate Companies and sales regions, including the key risks in the areas of strategy, markets, operations, management and resources, finance as well as sustainability. The likelihood of the risk occurring was classified into four categories. Where possible and appropriate, the identified risks were subject to a quantifiable assessment, taking into consideration any measures already implemented. Alternatively, a qualitative assessment of the risk exposure was applied.
The risk council, consisting of representatives of the divisions and the Corporate Staff and headed by the Chief Risk Officer, held one meeting. The main content of the discussions was the analysis of the adapted risk management process and the new risk management reporting software. In addition, the divisional risk maps were closely analyzed.
In accordance with the annual risk reporting process, the Executive Committee and divisional management discussed the risk maps in June/July of the reporting year. They defined, at the appropriate level, the key risks of the GF Corporation, the divisions and the GF Corporate Companies and sales regions, and determined adequate measures to mitigate those risks. The outcome of these workshops was included in the risk report for 2021, which was approved by the Board of Directors in December 2021. In addition, the Board of Directors held a risk management workshop in November 2021 with the aim to define all relevant risks from a Board of Directors’ viewpoint and compare the findings with the risk assessment of the Executive Committee. The result of this workshop as well as the determined measures in order to mitigate or control the risks defined were included in the 2021 risk report.
The multi-stage procedure, including workshops at divisional management, Executive Committee, and Board of Directors level, has proven to be effective. In addition, Internal Audit assess the risk maps prepared by the GF Corporate Companies.
The following key risks were identified: the disruption of supply chains, the negative economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, and cyber risks. Measures to reduce these and other risks were defined and are being implemented in line with the strategic targets of the GF Corporation and the three divisions.
Financial risk management. 
Through its different business activities, the GF Corporation is exposed to various financial risks such as credit risk, market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk, and price risk), and liquidity risk. The following sections provide an overview of the extent of the individual risks as well as the goals, principles, and processes employed for measuring, monitoring, mitigating, and managing the risks.

Liquidity risk Insufficient liquidity to pay liabilities due. 
Constant monitoring of liquidity, liquidity reserves and unused credit lines. 
The Board of Directors bears ultimate responsibility for financial risk management. The Board of Directors has mandated the Audit Committee with monitoring the development and implementation of the risk management principles. The Audit Committee reports regularly to the Board of Directors on this matter.
207


Annual Report 2021. 
The financial risk management principles are designed to identify and analyze the risks to which the GF Corporation is exposed and to establish appropriate control mechanisms. The principles of financial risk management are regularly reviewed, taking into consideration changes in the relevant financial markets and in the activities of the GF Corporation.
Credit risk. 
As of the balance sheet date, the maximum amount of credit risk including off-balance sheet commitments was as follows:
CHF million 31.12.2021 31.12.2020. 
On-balance sheet. 
Cash and cash equivalents 932 834. 
Trade accounts receivable 611 550. 
Other accounts receivable (excl. tax credits) 36 30. 
Accrued income 13 16. 
Other financial assets 93 98. 
Derivative financial instruments 5 2. 
Total on-balance sheet 1’690 1’530. 
Off-balance sheet. 
Guarantees to third parties 1 90 90. 
Total off-balance sheet 90 90 1 Thereof used CHF 89 million (previous year: CHF 89 million).
Cash is predominantly deposited with leading Swiss, German, US, and Chinese banks with a credit rating of at least BBB– (Standard & Poor’s). Furthermore and in accordance with the investment policy, all financial transactions are only entered into with counterparties deemed creditworthy. In addition, cash holdings are allocated to different banks in order to limit the counterparty risk. The maximum amount of cash to deposit with a bank is defined in relation to its credit rating. Cash deposits, current accounts, and cash investments have a maturity of less than three months.
Transactions involving derivative financial instruments are only entered into with counterparties with a credit rating of at least BBB– (Standard & Poor’s). The purpose of such transactions is to hedge against currency risks.
The risk of concentrated credit risks on trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their wide diversification across industries and regions. The extent of credit risk is determined by individual characteristics of the customers and in order to assess this risk, a review of creditworthiness based on the customer’s financial situation and historical experience is performed on a regular basis.
The maximum credit risk on financial instruments corresponds to their carrying amounts. No additional arrangements have been entered into that would increase the risk above the carrying amounts.
Currency risk. 
Currency risk occurs in connection with transactions (in particular the purchase and sale of goods) which are effected in currencies that differ from the functional currencies. Through such transactions the GF Corporation is mainly exposed to changes in the euro, US dollar, Chinese yuan, and Turkish lira exchange rates. These currency risks can be reduced by purchasing and producing goods in the functional currencies (congruency principle) or by entering into foreign currency forwards (cash flow hedges), usually for a maximum of 12 months.

Derivative financial instruments. 
The table below shows the foreign currency forward contract and actual values of the foreign currency contracts used to mitigate currency risk:

Negative actual value (recognized as other liabilities) –1 –0 –2 –2. 
Net actual value 2 1 4 0. 
The balance sheet hedges include foreign currency forward contracts that are used to hedge loans to GF Corporate Companies in foreign currencies. Unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value are reported in the financial result. These hedges are mainly in euro, US dollars, Romanian leus, and Canadian dollars, and expire usually no later than 12 months from the balance sheet date.
The balance sheet hedges also include foreign currency forward contracts that serve to hedge currency risks on receivables and payables. Like the currency effects on the underlying balance sheet item, gains and losses from changes to the actual value of these contracts are recognized in “Other operating income”. These balance sheet hedges are mainly in US dollars and euro and expire no later than 12 months from the balance sheet date.
Accounting principles. 
Derivative financial instruments used to hedge balance sheet items are accounted for at market values through the income statement. Hedging transactions on probable future cash flows (cash flow hedges) are initially accounted for at market values through equity. Later, when an asset or a liability results from the hedged underlying transaction, the gains and losses previously recognized in equity are transferred to the income statement. In the case of cash flow hedges, the volume of the foreign currency forward contracts is limited to maximum 75% of the probable future cash flows.

Annual Report 2021. 
Liquidity risk. 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the GF Corporation is unable to meet its obligations when they fall due. Liquidity is constantly monitored to ensure that it is adequate. Liquidity reserves are held in order to offset the usual fluctuations in requirements. At the same time, the GF Corporation has unused credit lines in case more serious fluctuations occur. The total amount of unused credit lines as of 31 December 2021 was CHF 772 million (previous year: CHF 732 million). The credit lines are maintained with different banks in order to ensure swift and adequate access to these credit lines.

This section provides other information and disclosures not included in other sections, for example, information about employee benefits obligations and other non-current financial assets. It also includes an overview of the balance sheet-related deferred tax assets and liabilities and the events occurring after the reporting date.

Employee benefit plans in Switzerland are overfunded by CHF 99 million (previous year: CHF 24 million). This is mainly due to the good performance of the investments and the change in the technical parameters from BVG 2015 to BVG 2020 (BVG: federal law on pension benefits).
The employee benefit plan in the UK is underfunded by the amount of CHF 8 million (previous year: CHF 20 million). The amount of the underfunding depends significantly on the value of the securities and on the discount rate and the expected mortality rate used in the calculation of the pension liabilities. The total economic obligation, which represents the expected cash outflow in the medium term, amounts to CHF 10 million (previous year: CHF 16 million).
The recognized economic obligation from the employee benefit plan with no assets of their own, i.e. unfunded plans, amounted to CHF 37 million (previous year: CHF 36 million) and concerns primarily plans in Germany and Sweden. The CHF 3 million increase in the economic obligation is included in the pension fund expenses for the period.
Changes in the recognized economic obligations from employee benefit plans and the employer-paid contributions for the year under review amounted to CHF 25 million (previous year: CHF 34 million) and are included in “Personnel expenses”.
218


Annual Report 2021. 
Accounting principles. 
The employee benefit plans of the GF Corporation comply with the legislation in force in each country. Employee benefit plans are mostly institutions and foundations that are independent of the GF Corporation. They are usually financed by both employee and employer contributions.
The economic impact of the employee benefit plans is assessed each year. Surpluses or deficits are determined by means of the annual statements of each specific benefit plan, which are based either on Swiss GAAP FER 26 (Swiss benefit plans) or on the accepted methods in each foreign country (foreign plans). An economic benefit is capitalized if it is permitted and intended to use the surplus to reduce the employer contributions. Any employer contribution reserves are also capitalized. An economic obligation is recognized as a liability if the conditions for a provision are met. They are reported under “Employee benefit obligations”. Changes in the economic benefit or economic obligation, as well as the contributions incurred for the period, are recognized in “Personnel expenses” in the income statement.
5.2 Other financial assets. 
CHF million 31.12.2021 31.12.2020. 
Investments in associates 2 0. 
Non-current loans and receivables 80 83. 
Securities for the settlement of pension liabilities 3 3. 
Other securities 8 12. 
Other financial assets third parties 90 98. 
Total 93 98. 
In 2021, GF acquired a further stake of 16.67% in Oxford Flow Utility & Industries Ltd. As of 31 December, the stake amounted to 22.96%. Significant influence was assumed and the investment was reclassified from other securities to investment in associates. The acquired goodwill has been offset within equity.
The reduction in non-current loans was mainly due to currency effects. The former iron foundry in Austria drew down an additional CHF 3 million under an existing credit line granted by GF at the time of the divestment.
In 2020, GF supported an operational and financial restructuring of the other divested iron foundries in Germany (Fondium group). The financial restructuring included the sale of all remaining investments in these associates. In addition to the sale of the investments in the Fondium group, the loan terms were modified in 2020. CHF 72 million of subordinated loans before value adjustments were converted into mezzanine financing. For other subordinated loans over CHF 8 million before value adjustments, the maturity was extended to the end of 2024 and the interest was waived. Based on the original restructuring agreement, another CHF 8 million of subordinated loans were converted to mezzanine financing in 2021. As in the previous year, the mezzanine financing bears a conditional interest of up to 5% and the expected maturities remain at 7 to 10 years.
Other securities consist mainly of investment securities held in the captive insurance, non-consolidated investments without significant influence, as well as non-current prepayments.
219


Annual Report 2021. 
Management assumptions and estimates. 
The recoverability of non-current loans and receivables is assessed based on the debtors’ ability to repay on time and in full. In order to build this assessment, management regularly observes the debtors’ adherence to the interest payments and principal amortization schedule. In the case of investments in associates, management also assesses the debtor’s ability to continue as a going concern. Assessing the going concern assumptions requires management to assess the risk and opportunities of the debtors’ business models, which are inherently subject to a higher level of estimation uncertainty. Such assessments may change in the following year depending on the future development of the debtors’ businesses.
Accounting principles. 
Non-current loans and receivables are recognized at amortized cost. In addition, an impairment is recorded in case the assumed present value of expected cash flows is below the carrying value of the non-current loans and receivables.
Associates are companies over which the GF Corporation exercises significant influence. Investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method. Any acquired goodwill is offset within equity. The share of results of associates is reported in the financial result.

The effect of offsetting at the GF Corporate Company level amounted to CHF 41 million (previous year: CHF 55 million). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated based on the actually expected income tax rates for each GF Corporate Company. For further information on the recognition of tax loss carryforwards, see .
note 1.6. 
Income taxes. 
Temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, for which no deferred tax liabilities have been recognized, amounted to CHF 557 million as of 31 December 2021 (previous year: CHF 459 million).
Accounting principles. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset within GF Corporate Companies when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes related to the same fiscal authority. No deferred tax is provided for temporary differences on investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the GF Corporation and where it is probable that the temporary difference will not be reversed in the foreseeable future.
5.4 Events after the balance sheet date. 
The consolidated financial statements were approved and released for publication by the Board of Directors on 22 February 2022. They must also be approved at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.
There were no events between 31 December 2021 and 22 February 2022 that would require an adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and equity or would need to be disclosed under this heading.
