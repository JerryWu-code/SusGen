Ørsted's vision of creating a world that runs entirely on green energy was supported by a strong performance and new ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets in 2019: — We have increased the scope of our greenhouse gas intensity target to include all emissions from our own operations and from energy we source for our operations. — Furthermore, we have set a new ambitious target to reduce the emissions from our supply chain and the sale of gas and fossilbased power by 50% in 2032. — Our total heat and power generation increased by 9% to 28.4TWh in 2019, of which 86% was based on renewable energy. — Our scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas intensity decreased by 50% to 65g CO2e/kWh. — Our scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 4%.
New ambitious targets in 2019 By the end of 2019, we have reduced the greenhouse gas emission intensity from our energy generation by 86%, compared with 2006, by converting our CHP plants to sustainable biomass and deploying offshore and onshore wind.
We are determined to continue to eliminate emissions, and therefore, we have decided 1.1 CFO’s review that we want to be carbon neutral by 2025. Our target for all direct greenhouse gas emissions from our operations (scope 1) and indirect emissions from the energy we source for our operations (scope 2) is 10g CO2e/kWh in 2025, which corresponds to a 98% reduction compared with 2006. To meet the target, we will phase out coal by 2023, and we have a wide range of other carbon reduction initiatives underway, including a full conversion of our company car fleet to electric vehicles by 2025. We will continue to investigate solutions for the remaining emissions, which could also include investing in certified carbon removal projects.
We also address the indirect carbon emissions from across our supply chain and energy trading activities (scope 3 emissions). We have set a target of 50% reduction from 2018 to 2032. To meet this target, we have decided to gradually phase out trading of natural gas and to work with our strategic suppliers to decarbonise our supply chain. We will work towards achieving carbon neutrality in our total carbon footprint, both direct and indirect, by 2040.
Renewable energy capacity Our installed renewable capacity increased by 19% to 9.9GW in 2019.
In July, we commissioned the 184MW onshore wind farm Lockett and in December, we commissioned Hornsea 1, the world’s largest offshore wind farm with a capacity of 1,218MW which will supply more than 1.1 million UK homes with green power. The bioconversion of Asnæs Power Station was completed in December 2019 and added 125MW biomass- based heat capacity to our portfolio.
Energy generation Our total power generation in 2019 was 20.1TWh, which was 17% higher than in 2018.
The power generation in Offshore increased by 19% to 12.0TWh in 2019. The increase was primarily due to ramp-up of power generation capacity at Hornsea 1 and full-year effects from Borkum Riffgrund 2 and Walney Extension. The power generation in Onshore was 3.5TWh in 2019, 3.0TW higher than last year due to the full-year effects from the acquisition of Lincoln Clean Energy in October 2018 and new wind farms.
Thermal power generation decreased by 30% to 4.6TWh relative to 2018. The decrease was mainly due to lower combined heat and power generation in 2019 because of a lower heat demand, and to the divestment of the Dutch power plant Enecogen in 2018.
Our total heat and power generation increased by 9% to 28.4TWh in 2019, with 86% being based on renewable energy. The increase in the green share of energy of 11 percentage points was driven by increased wind-based generation and reduced thermal energy generation with a relatively higher green share of fuels.
Greenhouse gas emissions We reduced our coal consumption by 52% and our natural gas consumption by 29% from 2018 to 2019. Consequently, our scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions were reduced by 47% to 1.8 million tonnes CO2e in 2019.
The reduced use of fossil fuels, the relative increase in the use of sustainable biomass, and the increased energy generation from wind resulted in a 50% reduction of our scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas intensity to 65g CO2e/kWh. Our scope 3 emissions were reduced by 4% from 2018 to 2019, mainly driven by lower gas sales.
Safety In May, an employee of one of our contractors died after a serious accident at the Avedøre Power Station. We are deeply affected by this. Safety is of utmost importance to us, and we have initiated several improvement tracks to ensure that an accident like this will never happen again.

1.6 Basis of reporting. 
About this report In this report, you will find the complete set of Ørsted’s environment, social and governance (ESG) performance indicators. These are the data that we use in our reporting to various investor schemes and as the foundation for our answers to questions from investors and other stakeholders.
A selection of the data in this report is also presented in our: – annual report 2019, consolidated ESG statements – sustainability report 2019.
This report contains Ørsted´s statement on the underrepresented gender in accordance with section 99B of the Danish Financial Statement Act (Årsregnskabsloven). See note 3.2 'Gender diversity'.
ESG data collection and data quality We continuously seek to develop our ESG data set in order to support our business and to provide our stakeholders with relevant and transparent reporting of our ESG performance. All our ESG data are reported to the same consolidation system, and we apply the same processes and tools to our ESG reporting, as to our financial reporting.
Consolidation of ESG data The ESG performance data is consolidated according to the same principles as the financial statements. The consolidated ESG performance data thus comprises the parent company Ørsted A/S and subsidiaries controlled by Ørsted A/S.
Data from associates and joint ventures is not included in the consolidated ESG perform ance data.
The scoping and consolidation of health, safety and environment (HSE) incidents deviate from the above-described principles. HSE incident data is collected using an operational scope. This means that irrespective of our ownership share, we include 100% of injuries, environmental incidents, hours worked, etc., from all operations where Ørsted is responsible for HSE, including safety for our external suppliers.
All data presented follows the principles above, unless otherwise specified in the accounting policy for the individual indicator. Accounting policies for all our ESG data can be found next to each data table in the environmental (E), social (S) and governance (G) sections. The calculation factors used in this report are listed at the end of the report together with references.
New ESG indicators in 2019 – Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions (introduced in the H1 2019 interim ESG report). – Internal energy savings (MWh). – Electric company vehicles (%). – Green bond proceeds allocated to offshore wind projects (DKK million/year). – Avoided emissions from allocated green bonds proceeds (tonnes CO2). – Renewable share of energy consumption.
Revised ESG indicators 2019 – GHG intensity: Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions per kWh energy generated (introduced in the H1 2019 interim ESG report). – People powered (added onshore wind capacity, solar capacity and introduced state- specific emission factors for sites in the US).
Discontinued ESG indicators – Committee information (members, meetings, participation) for committes below the Board of Directors. – Energy savings for power customers. – FTEs divided by age groups. – Number of people who have left the company divided by reasons to leave.
Business changes impacting ESG data There has been no M&A related bussiness changes with significant ESG impact in 2019.
Financial scope. 
We use a financial scope for our data collection. Thus, the consolidated ESG performance data comprises the parent company Ørsted A/S and subsidiaries controlled by Ørsted A/S.
Financial consoli dation. 
We use the same consolidation method and consolidation application for our ESG data as for our financial data.
External review. 
All ESG data in both Ørsted's annual and sustainability reports has been reviewed by PwC. All data in this report covered by the ESG review is marked with a ' ' in the tables. See the auditor’s limited assurance report on page 40 for information about the external review.

2.1 Renewable capacity. 
Accounting policies. 
Installed renewable capacity The installed renewable capacity is calculated as the cumulative renewable gross capacity installed by Ørsted before divestments.
For installed renewable thermal capacity, we use the heat capacity, as heat is the primary outcome of thermal energy generation, and as bioconversions of the combined heat and power plants are driven by heat contracts.
Decided (FID) renewable capacity Decided (FID) capacity is the renewable capacity for which a final investment decision (FID) has been made.
Awarded and contracted renewable capacity The awarded renewable capacity is based on the capacities which have been awarded to Ørsted in auctions and tenders. The contracted capacity is the capacity for which Ørsted has signed a contract or power purchase agreement (PPA) concerning a new renewable energy plant. Typically, offshore wind farms are awarded, whereas onshore wind farms are contracted. We include the full capacity if more than 50% of PPAs/offtake are secured.
Installed storage capacity The battery storage capacity is included after commercial operational date (COD) has been achived. The capacity is presented as megawatts of alternating current (MWac).

The power generation capacity increased by 12% from 2018 to 2019, due to an increase in offshore capacity of 20% following the ongoing commissioning of Hornsea 1 and an increase in onshore capacity by 23% following the commisioning of the onshore wind farm Lockett.
Thermal biomass-based heat capacity increased by 9% in 2019 because of the bioconversion of Asnæs Power Station. This was also the reason for the 4% increase in total (non-fuel specific) thermal heat generation capacity.
The capacity for the replaced units at Asnæs Power Station will be withdrawn in 2020.
Accounting policies. 
Power generation capacity Power generation capacity from offshore wind farms is calculated and included from the time when the individual wind turbine has passed a 240-hour test. Generation capacities for onshore wind and solar are included after COD.
The Gunfleet Sands and Walney 1 and 2 offshore wind farms have been consolidated according to ownership interest. Other wind farms, solar farms and CHP plants are financially consolidated.
Heat and power generation capacity, thermal The thermal heat and power generation capacity is a measure of the maximum capability to generate heat and power.
The capacity can change over time with plant modifications. For each CHP plant, the capacity is given for generation with the primary fuel mix. Overload is not included.
Fuel-specific capacities measure the maximum capacity using the specified fuel as primary fuel at the multi-fuel plants. Therefore, the total sum amounts to more than 100%.
CHP plants which have been taken out of primary operation and put on standby are not included.

Offshore power generation increased by 19% relative to 2018. The increase was primarily due to generation from new wind farms as well as higher wind speeds.
Onshore wind and solar power generation was 3.5TWh in 2019.
Thermal power generation was 30% lower than in 2018 because we generated heat without combined power generation at Asnæs Power Station and divested our Dutch power plant Enecogen in 2018.
Thermal heat generation was 5% lower than in 2018 due to warmer weather in H1 2019, leading to a lower demand for heat, which was partly offset by colder weather and higher heat generation in H2 2019.
Accounting policies. 
Power generation Power generation from wind farms is determined as generation sold. The Gunfleet Sands 1 and 2 and Walney 1 and 2 offshore wind farms have been consolidated according to ownership interest.
Thermal power generation is determined as net generation sold based on settlements from the official Danish production database. Data for generation from foreign facilities are provided by the operators.
Heat generation Thermal heat (including steam) generation is measured as net output sold to heat customers.

2.4 Green energy share. 
The green share of our heat and power generation amounted to 86% in 2019, up 11 percentage points relative to 2018. The increase was due to higher generation from wind farms, increased thermal generation from biomass and reduced heat and power generation based on coal and gas.
The share of generation from wind increased by 14 percentage points as a result of new offshore generation capacity in the UK and. 
Germany as well as full-year effect from the acquisition of Lincoln Clean Energy in October 2018.
Our share of generation based on biomass decreased by 3 percentage points. However, the biomass share of energy generation at the combined heat and power plants increased by 10 percentage points to 68% in 2019. The coal-based share of our generation decreased by 8 percentage points, primarily due to lower power generation at the Asnæs Power Station.
The 3 percentage point reduction in our share of generation based on natural gas was primarily due to the divestment of our 50% ownership share in the gas-fired power plant Enecogen in the Netherlands in 2018.
The green share of our generation increased from 75% in 2018 to 86% in 2019. The increase was due to higher generation from offshore and onshore wind, increased use of biomass and reduced use of coal and natural gas. The category 'Other' includes solar, biogas, oil and sourced power.
Accounting policies. 
Green energy share The green (renewable energy) share of our heat and power generation and the distribution of the generation on the individual energy sources and fuels are calculated on the basis of the energy sources used and the energy generated at the different energy plants.
For combined heat and power plants, the share of the specific fuel (e.g. biomass) is calculated relative to the total fuel consumption for a given plant/ unit within a given time period. The specific fuel share is then multiplied by the total heat and power generation for the specific plant/unit in the specific period. The result is the fuel-based generation for the individual unit – for example the biomass-based generation of heat and power from the CHP plant unit within a given time period.
Energy generation based on renewable energy sources is added up to a total which tallies with total generation. The percentage share of the individual energy sources is calculated by dividing the generation from the individual energy source by the total generation.
The following energy sources and fuels are considered renewable energy: wind, solar, biomass and biogas. The following energy sources are considered fossil energy sources: coal, natural gas, oil and sourced power.

Offshore wind Availability was at 93%, the same level as the year before. The average portfolio windspeed was 9.2m/s in 2019, which was in line with a normal wind year.
Onshore wind Wind speeds averaged 7.3m/s, which was at the same level as 2018.
Other The number of degree days was 5% lower in 2019, meaning that the weather was warmer than in 2018. This led to a lower need for heat generation, which explains the 5% drop in heat generation in 2019.
Energy efficiency increased by 6%, primarily because of a relative higher combined heat and power generation in 2019 in relation to power- and heat-only generation.
Accounting policies. 
Availability Availability is calculated as the ratio of actual production to the possible production, which is the sum of lost production and actual production in a given period. The production-based availability (PBA) is impacted by grid and wind-turbine outages, which are technical production losses. PBA is not impacted by market requested shutdowns and wind farm curtailments, as this is deemed not to be reflective of site performance, but due to external factors. Total availability is determined by weighting the individual wind farm's availability against the capacity of the wind farm.
Load factor The load factor is calculated as the ratio between actual generation over a period relative to potential generation, which is possible by continuously exploiting the maximum capacity over the same period. The load factor is commercially adjusted.
Commercially adjusted means that, for Danish and German offshore wind farms, the load factor is adjusted if the offshore wind farm has been financially compensated by the transmission system operators in situations where the offshore wind farm is available for generation, but the output cannot be supplied to the grid due to maintenance or grid interruptions. Wind farms in other countries are not compensated for non-access to the grid.
New wind turbines are included in the calculation of availability and load factor once they have passed a 240-hour test for offshore and COD for onshore.
Wind speed Wind speeds for the areas where Ørsted's offshore wind farms are located are provided to Ørsted by an external supplier. Wind speeds are weighted on the basis of the capacity of the individual offshore wind farms and consolidated to an Ørsted total.
Onshore wind speed is based on wind speed measurements from anemometers on the wind turbines. Due to the location of these anemometers on the turbine nacelles, these measurements understate actual wind speed conditions on site as they are impacted by wake and blockage effect. Normal wind speed is a 20-year historical wind speed average.
Degree days Degree days are a measure of how cold it has been and thus indicate the amount of energy needed to heat a building. The number of degree days helps to compare the heat demand for a given year with a normal year. The number of degree days expresses the difference between an average indoor temperature of 17°C and the outside mean temperature for a given period. The need for heat increases with the number of degree days.
Energy efficiency, thermal generation Energy efficiency is calculated as total thermal heat and power generation divided by total energy content of fuels (lower caloric values) used in the generation of thermal heat and power.

Accounting policies. 
Direct GHG emissions (scope 1) The direct scope 1 emissions is based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and covers all direct emissions of greenhouse gases from Ørsted. The direct carbon emissions from the thermal heat and power plants are determined on the basis of the fuel quantities used in accordance with the EU ETS scheme. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions outside the EU ETS scheme are for the most part calculated as energy consumptions multiplied by emission factors.
Indirect GHG emissions (scope 2) The scope 2 emission reporting is based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and includes the indirect GHG emissions from the generation of power, heat and steam purchased and consumed by Ørsted. The scope 2 emissions are primarely calculated as the power volumes purchased multiplied by country-specific emission factors. Location-based is calculated based on average emission factors for each country, wheres as market-based takes the green power purchased into account and assumes that the nongreen power is delivered as residual power where the green part has been taken out.
Greenhouse gas emission intensity Greenhouse gas emission intensities are calcalated as total scope 1 and scope 2 (market-based) emissions divided by Ørsted's total heat and power generation, revenue and EBITDA, respectively.
The GHG intensity for CHP plants is calculated as scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions from CHP plants divided by total heat and power generation from CHP plants.
power during standstill and shutdown periods. Markets & Bioenergy also purchased power for four heat boilers which generate heat from power. The rest of the location-based scope 2 emissions originated from purchased heat and power for office buildings.
Ørsted´s greenhouse gas emission intensity decreased by 50% due to higher generation from offshore wind farms, new onshore wind farms as well as reduced use of coal, mainly due to generation of heat without power at Asnæs Power Station and a lower use of natural gas following the divestment of the Enecogen power plant.
Our greenhouse gas intensity was reduced by 50% in 2019. We are well on track to meet our target of a greenhouse gas emission intensity of no more than 20g CO2e/ kWh in 2023 and 10g CO2e/kWh in 2025.
Greenhouse gas emissions, scope 1 and 2, g CO2e/kWh For scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions, the main contributor was emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels at CHP plants. In 2019, the part of total scope 1 emissions coming from fossil fuel-based heat and power generation was 97%. The 47% reduction in scope 1 was mainly due to lower coalbased generation at the Asnæs, Esbjerg and Studstrup power stations as well as reduced consumption of natural gas after the sale of the Enecogen power plant in 2018.

In 2019, we set a target to reduce our scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 50% from 2018 to 2032.
Our scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions were reduced by 4% from 2018 to 2019. The main driver for this reduction was reduced gas sales, which accounted for 88% of our total scope 3 emissions in 2019. Gas sales was 5% lower in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to lower gas prices. The impact on scope 3 from the reduced total gas sales in 2019 was partly offset by increased sales of liquefied natural gas (LNG), as LNG has a higher upstream greenhouse gas emission factor compared to natural gas.
The second-largest scope 3 emission driver was our regular (non-certified green) power trade to end-customers. We trade our own generated green power to B2C and B2B end-customers. But we also trade regular power to some of our B2B customers. All power trade to B2C customers is green power. The greenhouse gas emissions from the regular power trade to end-customers were reduced by 3% from 2018 to 2019, whereas the volume of green power sales increased by 17% (see note 2.6).
The third-largest scope 3 driver was the craddle to installation life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions from new wind farms. The 28% decrease in capital goods is due to us commissioning a lower level of new (megawatt) capacity in 2019 compared to 2018.
Accounting policies. 
Greenhouse gas emissions, scope 3 The scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are reported based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol which divides the scope 3 inventory into 15 subcategories (C1-C15).
GHG emissions from: – C1 are categorised spend data mulitiplied by relevant spend-category-specific emission factors. – C2 include upstream GHG emissions from installed wind farms. Carbon emissions are included from cradle to operations and maintenance for single wind turbines. Wind farms are included from the month where the wind farm has acieved commercial operation date. – C3 are calculated based on actual fuel consumption and power sales multiplied by relevant emission factors. We include all power sales to end-customers and use separate emission factors for green and non-green power sales. – C4 only include fuel for helicopter transport.
Emissions from other transportation types are included in the emission factors we use for purchased goods and services. – C5 are calculated based on actual waste data multiplied by relevant emission factors. – C6 are calculated based on mileage allowances for employee travel in own cars and GHG emissions from airplane travel provided by our travel agent. – C7 are calculated based on estimates for distance travelled and travel type (e.g. car and train). – C9 are calculated based on volumes of residual products, estimated distances transported and relevant GHG emission factors for transportation. – C11 are calculated based on actual sales of gas to both end-users and wholesale as reported in our ESG consolidation system. The total gas trade is divided into natural gas, LNG gas and biogas which have specific up- and downstream emission factors.
The subcategories C10 and C12-C15 are not relevant for Ørsted, as we have no greenhouse gas emissions within these categories.

Accounting policies. 
Avoided carbon emissions The avoided carbon emissions due to generation from offshore and onshore wind farms are calculated on the basis of the assumption that the generation from wind farms replaces an equal quantity of power generated using fossil fuels.
The carbon emission factor from fossil fuels is based on an average fossil fuel mix in the specific country. Data is extracted from the International Energy Agency, IEA. Power generation at a wind farm does not have direct carbon emissions, and no secondary effects are included, from neither CHP plants nor offshore wind farms. The avoided carbon emissions are calculated as the offshore wind farm’s generation multiplied by the emission factor.
It is assumed that the use of 1GJ of biomass fuel avoids the use of 1GJ of fossil fuels. The upstream carbon emissions (from production, manufactoring and transportation of biomass) are included in the calculation.
The accounting policies for avoided carbon emissions follow the principles of the GHG Project Protocol and the UNFCCC methodology.
Carbon emissions Carbon emissions include scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions from thermal heat and power generation. For more details, see '2.7 Greenhouse gas emissions, scope 1 and 2'.
Avoided carbon emissions are the result of installed wind farms and conversions of CHP plants to using biomass as fuel. If these projects had not been undertaken, other sources would have provided the power generated.
In 2019, the avoided emissions increased by 40% due to the increase in wind-based power generation.
At the end of 2019, we have avoided an accumulated total of 46 million tonnes carbon dioxide since 2006. This is the result of our wind-based and biomass-converted energy generation and corresponds to 37% of the accumulated carbon emissions from thermal energy generation at Ørsted since 2006.

2.10 Energy consumption. 
The total fuel consumption decreased in 2019 driven by lower thermal energy generation.
Biomass consumption was at the same level as in 2018, whereas our coal consumption decreased by 52%, primarely due to generation of heat without power at Asnæs Power Station in the period up until the new biomass converted unit was taken in use towards the end of the year.
The 29% lower gas consumption was primarely due to the divestment of the Dutch power plant Enecogen.
The power purchased and consumed by Ørsted increased by 9% from 2018 to 2019. The main driver for the increase in power consumption was power used for heat generation in electric boilers. The electric boilers are used in situations with simultaneous high power generation and high district heating demand.
Accounting policies. 
Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption Includes all energy consumption including energy consumption that leads to scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions. Energy consumption includes all fuels used at CHP plants (lower caloric values) and other energy usage (oil, natural gas and diesel).
Certified renewable wooden biomass sourced Certified biomass are defined as wooden biomass, i.e. wood pellets and wood chips. Biomass is measured as sourced wooden biomass delivered to the individual combined heat and power plants within the reporting period. Certified sustainable wooden biomass sourced must be certified within at least one of the claim cate gories accepted by the Danish industry agreement on certified biomass. Accepted claim categories are: FSC 100%, FSC Mix, PEFC 100% and SBP compliant. Certified biomass is calculated as the amount of sourced wooden biomass compared to the total amount of sourced wooden biomass delivered to individual CHP plants within the reporting period.
Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption Heat and power purchased and consumed by Ørsted is reported for CHP plants, other facilities and administrative buildings. Heat and power consumption excludes consumption of own generated heat and power at the CHP plants. For consumption related to administration and other processes, we calculate direct consumption on the basis of invoices.
Green share of total energy consumption Is calculated as renewable energy sourced (biomass and certified green power) for own consumption divided by total energy sourced for own consumption.
Internal energy savings In 2018, Ørsted A/S signed a five-year climate partnership agreement with a target of 15GWh energy savings. The scope of the energy savings covers both heat and power consumption. Projects are included when they are fully implemented and operational.
Electric vehicles in the company vehicle fleet Ørsted has joined the global EV100 initiative. The statement is prepared on the basis of the EV100 guidelines. The data excludes vehicles from our power distribution, B2C and city light businesses as these are in the process of being divested.

Accounting policies. 
Water withdrawal Water withdrawal includes all water resources that Ørsted either withdraw directly from groundwater or consume from waterworks. This includes: – water withdrawal for process use (boilers, flue gas cleaning, ash management, etc.) – water withdrawal converted to steam or hot water and resold to business partners – water withdrawal for use in offices and other buildings.
The total volume of water withdrawal is measured based on meter readings or invoices from suppliers. Using a corporate standard value, an estimated consumption is calculated in cases where exact data is not available.
Surface water is out of scope. This means that cooling water consumption from ocean water at CHP plants is not included.
Water stress Water stess is measured at site level. The methodology used to assess water stress is WRI’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. The calculated output of this accounting practice is Ørsted's total withdrawal of water from water-stressed areas.
Wastewater discharge Wastewater includes all planned and unplanned discharges of water from Ørsted, except cooling water from power plants.
For facilities, wastewater discharges are recorded based on meter readings. Where wastewater is removed by road tanker, discharges are based on invoices. For offices and warehouses, wastewater discharges are presumed to be equivalent to water consumption.

2.12 Waste. 
The total volume of waste decreased by 32% from 2018 to 2019. The primary driver was a reduction in the amount of oil-containing wastewater from the oil terminal in Fredericia due to lower oil production from the North Sea. The oil-containing wastewater had to be treated as waste similar to the previous years because of a high content of pollutants.
in 2019, Ørsted began testing a new process for cleaning the oil-containing water to eliminate the need for treating it as a waste fraction. This led to a reduction of 1,347 tonnes of sludge for incineration.
Non-hazardous waste increased by 16% in 2019. The primary driver was the construction activities from Hornsea 2, which entailed more than 1,200 tonnes waste for reuse and recycling.
Accounting policies. 
Waste by type and disposal method Waste is generally reported on the basis of invoices received from waste recipients, supplemented with plant-specific measuring methods for commercial facilities, including construction activities.
Residual products (fly ash, gypsym, etc.) from the CHP plants are not included, as they are sold as products for reuse and are as such not categorised as waste.
Soil from excavation projects is not included in the waste statement.

Three of the incidents were oil leakages from cables or piping. All contaminated soil has been removed and cleaned, where possible. Work is still ongoing for one incident concerning a distribution cable owned by Ørsted which was damaged by a third party away from Ørsted premises.
The fourth incident was a SF6 gas leakage from a power cable.
The reduction in NOx and SO2 air emissions was due to a lower thermal heat and power generation.
Accounting policies. 
Environmental incidents An environmental incident is an unintended incident which has a negative impact on the environment.
We report environmental incidents using operational scopes, such as safety incidents.
We register all environmental incidents at facilities where we are responsible for the operation in terms of environmental management.
The materiality of an incident is determined on the basis of an assessment of the extent, dispersion and impact on the environment. On this basis, all environmental incidents are categorised on a scale from 1 (slight impact) to 5 (massive impact). Actual incidents in categories 4 (major impact) and 5 (massive impact) are reported.
Other air emissions: nitrogen oxides (NOX) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) Nitrogen oxides, and sulphur dioxide are only reported for combined heat and power plants. Nitrogen oxides, and sulphur dioxide emissions from other combustions are not included. Nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide are primarily measured by continuous mea- surement, but may also be based on plant- specific emission factors.

2.14 Biodiversity – protected areas. 
Accounting policies. 
Biodiversity data only covers offshore wind farms.
Offshore wind farm lease or agreement areas cover large footprints. The wind farm is comprised of a range of infrastructure, including offshore wind turbines and cables. The physical footprint of this infrastructure, however, makes up a relatively small proportion of a total wind farm area. Nonetheless, the reporting here considers total wind farm areas for completeness and to recognise relevant interactions with protected habitats and species.
In some markets, we install transmission assets from the offshore wind farm which includes onshore and offshore export cables and substations. However these are usually required to be divested near to or when the wind farm is commissioned as required by national legislation. Therefore, the data for export cables represents not yet divested transmission assets on some wind farms, and does not include onshore parts of offshore wind farms.
Protected areas Protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value follow the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards, disclosure 304-1. This includes the list of protected areas described, such as IUCN Protected Area Management Categories, the Ramsar Convention and national legislation.
The indicators are the cumulative square kilometres or length of cables in kilometres covered by our operational sites. The areas reported represent Ørsted’s ownership share by year-end. Data is initially recognised from the commercial operation date (COD).
Our wind farms in European waters and in APAC do not currently overlap with any protected areas for nature conservation.
The indicator illustrating the area of wind farms that are partially inside protected areas has increased since last year, primarily because the new offshore wind farm Hornsea 1 has been included. Hornsea 1 spans an area of 407 km2 at a distance of 120 km from the Yorkshire coast in the UK and overlaps with the Southern North Sea Special Area of Conservation (SAC), which covers a large geographical area of 36,951 km2.
Additionally, a protected area surrounding Walney Extension Offshore Wind Farm has been confirmed as a designated area since 2018.
The indicator showing export cable routes partially inside protected areas has also increased since last year, again primarily due to the Hornsea 1 Offshore Wind Farm, which has three export cables.

The United Kingdom Adding Hornsea 1 increased the overall number of vulnerable and near-threatened bird species, such as the kittiwake, located within or near our UK operational footprint.
The offshore wind farm’s primary interaction with vulnerable species comes from its position overlapping with large protected areas. The size of these protected areas and their many constituent species increases the chance of vulnerable and threatened species being considered to overlap with the Hornsea 1 wind farm area.
As outlined in our Offshore wind biodiversity policy, we carry out detailed environmental consenting processes and ongoing environmental monitoring in compliance with local regulations on protection of nature conservation to ensure such species are considered carefully.
The Burbo Bank Offshore Wind Farm’s export cable route passes through the Dee Estuary Special Area of Conservation (SAC). The Dee Estuary is one of the largest estuaries in the UK, at a size of 140 km2, primarily stretching inland, and is recognised to be a multiple interest site for protected species. Three parallel cables of each 1.8 km pass through this SAC which is a protected area, designated for a critically endangered species, such as the European eel. Given this overlap, this species is recognised as relevant to our footprint.
The US In the US, our Block Island Wind Farm is located within an area where the endangered North Atlantic right whale and the vulnerable fin whale are known to migrate through and aggregate. We sail and operate in compliance with the US Marine Mammal Protection Act for the protection of marine mammals and their habitats.
Additionally, we work closely with relevant local interest organisations, authorities and other stakeholders, as well as the academic community, to understand key species such as these, and to ensure we use best available evidence and knowledge, and employ appropriate monitoring and mitigation techniques in our operations.

Accounting policies. 
Number of employees Employee data is recognised based on records from the Group's ordinary registration systems. The number of employees is determined as the number of employees at the end of each month converted to full-time equivalents (FTEs). Employees who have been made redundant are recognised until the expiry of their notice period, regardless of whether they have been released from all or some of their duties during their notice period.
Employee satisfaction survey results Ørsted conducts a comprehensive employee satisfaction survey once a year. With a few exceptions, all Ørsted employees are invited to participate in the survey. The following employees are not invited to participate: Employees who joined the company shortly before the employee satisfaction survey, employees who resigned shortly after the employee satisfaction survey, interns, consultants/advisers, and external temporary workers who do not have an employment contract with Ørsted. In the survey, a number of questions are asked. The answers are given on a scale from 1 to 10 and are subsequently converted to index figures on a scale from 0 to 100.
Sickness absence Sickness absence is calculated as the ratio between the number of sick days during the financial year and the planned number of annual working days in the respective country.
Turnover The employee turnover rate is calculated as the number of permanent employees who have left the company relative to the average number of permanent employees in the financial year.

We would like to unfold the full potential of all employees and ensure that men and women have the same opportunities for obtaining leadership positions. We have targets for increasing the proportion of women at all management levels, including 22% of women in senior leadership (Leadership Conference) and 30% female managers (middle management) by 2023.
To support this goal, 30% of the participants in our high-potential development programmes ranging from professional level career development to senior leadership were women in 2019. We have trained managers to reduce unconscious bias during people review meetings, and our senior leaders to focus specifically on building more diversity in our talent pipelines. In our 'Powered by talent' conference for more than four hundred senior managers from around the world held in November 2019, we emphasised that we expect all leaders to build more inclusive, diverse teams and gave guidance on how to do so.
To bring in more diverse talent, we encourage all candidates to apply, regardless of gender, race, age and cultural background. Recruitment processes include required female representation on shortlists, and we also ensure interviewees are diverse.
High-potential female candidates are identified in the annual People Review process and have a structured dialogue about development wishes and possibilities in the following People Development Dialogue.

Accounting policies. 
Gender pay is reported inspired by the manadatory gender pay reporting requirements in the UK.
We report gender pay gap for countries with more than 250 FTEs per country. The data is collected each year, after the general salary adjustment.
Definitions: Gender pay gap: The percentage men earn more in salary than women.
Gender bonus pay gap: The percentage men earn more in bonus payments than women.
Gender bonus distribution: The percentage of men and women in the workforce who receive bonusses.
Pay quartiles: The percentage of men and women on the employer's payroll for each quartile.
The differences in pay between men and women are caused by differences in gender mix across levels in the organisation.
There is a clear trend towards women comprising a smaller part of the population in higher salary pay quartiles, which relates to the lower percentage of women in higher management positions.

On 1 May 2019, a fatal accident occurred at Avedøre Power Station where an employee of one of our contractors was buried under coal during work in a silo. An independent investigation was completed to identify the root causes. Safety is of utmost importance to us, and we have initiated several improvement tracks to ensure that an accident like this will never happen again.
Our primary safety performance indicator is the total recordable injury rate (TRIR). TRIR includes all injuries that result in incapacity to work for one or more calendar days in addition to the day of the incident as well as injuries where the injured person is able to perform restricted work the day after the accident and injuries where the injured person has received medical treatment.
TRIR increased from 4.7 in 2018 to 4.9 in 2019.
We registered 106 total recordable injuries (TRIs), 71 of which involved employees working for our contractors. Contractors contributed with a total of 11.1 million working hours.
We continue to have a strong focus on safety. Our target is a TRIR of 2.9 or below in 2025.
Accounting policies. 
Safety Occupational injuries are calculated according to operational scope. Data from companies wholly or partly owned by Ørsted, and where Ørsted is responsible for safety, is included. Occupational injuries and lost-time injuries are calculated for both our own employees and contractors. Data from all Ørsted locations are recognised.
The lost-time injury frequency (LTIF) is calculated as the number of lost-time injuries per one million hours worked. The number of hours worked is based on 1,667 working hours annually per full-time employee and monthly records of the number of employees converted into full-time employees. For contractors, the actual number of hours worked is recognised on the basis of data provided by the contractor, access control systems at locations or estimates.
LTIF includes lost-time injuries defined as injuries that result in incapacity to work for one or more calendar days in addition to the day of the incident.
In addition to lost-time injuries, TRIR also includes injuries where the injured person is able to perform restricted work the day after the accident as well as accidents where the injured person has received medical treatment.
Fatalities are the number of people who lost their lives as a result of a work-related incident.
Permanent disability cases are injuries resulting in irreversible damage with permanent impairment, which is not expected to improve.

3.5 Job creation and people powered. 
Through our green energy investments, we have stimulated local growth and job creation.
In a lifecycle perspective, our and our partners’ investments in deploying green offshore energy have created 197 thousand job years from the installed and decided projects. In the period 2019-2025, we plan to invest DKK 200 billion in renewables, adding significantly to further local economic growth and job creation, not least in our new markets.
The main part of the jobs created in the value chain of offshore wind farms are jobs related to manufacturing, construction and installation.
The 22% increase in job years from 2018 to 2019 based on installed capacity was mainly related to the offshore wind farm Hornsea 1 commissioned in 2019.
People powered based on installed capacity increased by 25% compared to 2018, primarily due to Hornsea 1 and Lockett being commissioned in 2019. We will power a total of 33 million people with our installed, FID and awarded and contracted capacity. The 8% increase in the total number was due to the awarded contracts in the US in 2019.
Accounting policies. 
Job creation The number of job years is calculated on the basis of a factor for job years per megawatt installed provided by the International Renewable Energy Agency, IRENA. The job year creation factor is based on a 500MW offshore wind farm. The factor is not adjusted for other details, such as when the wind farm was constructed (wind turbine size and other parameters), wind farm size-specific parameters beyond a simple scaling of capacity size, geographical position (i.e. water depths and distance to shore).
The number of job years created relates to the value chain from procurement and manufacturing, over installation, operations and maintenance, to decommissioning. This means that job years related to, for example, mining and manufacturing of steel and concrete as well as local jobs, such as hotels and dining for people working on local sites, are not included. A lifetime of 25 years for all wind farms is used.
The number of job years relates to the installed capacity, and not Ørsted's ownership share of the wind farm. The number of job years varies during the lifespan, and most of the jobs are created in the beginning during construction and installation.
People powered The figure for people powered based on installed capacity is calculated using the installed capacity, the actual load factor and country-specific power consumption per person (state-specific consumption factors are used in the US).
People powered based on FID and awarded capacity is calculated on the basis of capacity, an average load factor based from business cases for offshore wind, onshore wind and solar power. Consumption is country-specific consumption per person (state- specific consumption factors are used in the US).

The reliability of supply increased during the year, with a 35% reduction of the average number of power grid interruptions (SAIFI) to 0.42 interruptions per customer.
The average duration of the power grid interruptions (SAIDI) was reduced by 15% to 28 minutes per customer.
Customer satisfaction for distribution customers in Denmark is determined on the basis of different types of interactions with distribution customers: disruption of supply, replacement of meters as well as customer and market support. Customer satisfaction is measured as the customer's satisfaction in a specific context. Respondents are randomly selected, and the survey is carried out by an external supplier.
Thus, customer satisfaction for residential and distribution customers relates to a specific situation, whereas customer satisfaction for business customers is an expression of the customer satisfaction with Ørsted as a whole. We have a number of very large business customers. In respect of these, it is important for us to assess the customer relationship in general and not just the experience of a specific situation.
Number of customers The number of customers in Denmark is retrieved from Ørsted's internal customer systems. The number of power customers is based on readings from Panda, the official system in Denmark.
A B2C power customer is defined as a counterpart receiving billable physical power. The counterpart is defined as a point of delivery (POD). One person can own one or more PODs, and since the person is billed on the basis of the number of PODs, the PODs make up the B2C power customer base.
Reliability of supply Reliability of supply is measured in terms of the power outage frequency (SAIFI) and the duration of outages (SAIDI) for customers.
The system average interruption frequency index (SAIFI) covers the frequency of announced and unannounced power outages for the customer. SAIFI is calculated as the average number of power outages per customer per year.
SAIFI is reported with and without the transmission grids, as these grids are operated by Energinet, the Danish transmission system operator, and therefore do not lie within the responsibility of Radius.
The system average interruption duration index ( SAIDI) covers the power outage duration experienced by the customers. SAIDI is calculated as the total duration of planned and unplanned power outages per customer per year. It is calculated as the total duration of customer interruptions divided by the total number of customers served.
Accounting policies. 
Customer satisfaction Customer satisfaction for residential customers (B2C) in Denmark is measured according to interaction between the customer and Ørsted. Thefore, the score is not an expression of the customers' overall satisfaction with Ørsted, but is rather related to a given situation. The score is calculated as a weighted score based on a number of different types of touch points. The current touch points are customer service for gas and power, outbound sales and web. An external supplier conducts interviews.
Customer satisfaction for business customers (B2B) is determined on the basis of customer satisfaction surveys among Ørsted's business customers in the countries where we have B2B customers. Customer satisfaction is determined on the basis of interviews about customers' satisfaction with Ørsted as a whole.

4.3 Group Executive Management. 
The Executive Board, consisting of our CEO Henrik Poulsen and CFO Marianne Wiinholt, undertakes the day-to-day management of the company through Group Executive Management, which consists of an additional five members.
The Board of Directors has laid down guidelines for the work of the Executive Board. The guidelines include a description of the division of work and the powers to enter into agreement on behalf of the company between the Board of Directors and the Executive Board.
The Board of Directors regularly discusses the CEO's performance, for example by following up on developments seen in relation to our strategy and objectives.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors and the CEO regularly discuss the cooperation between the Board of Directors and the Executive Board.
In addition to the safety target that makes up 10% of the cash-based bonus target for the Executive Board, we have implemented climate-related performance indicators in the incentive programmes for the Executive Board. The indicators focus on the green energy share of our generation and our greenhouse gas emission reductions. Previously, climaterelated indicators were only rewarded indirectly through green energy build-out targets. You can find information about the members of the Executive Board, including their previous employment and other executive functions, in our annual report on page 56 and in our new remuneration report.
Accounting policies.

4.4 Good business conduct, green bonds and tax. 
The Chairman of the Audit & Risk Committee is responsible for managing our whistleblower scheme. Internal Audit receives and handles any reports submitted. Our employees and other associates may report serious offences, such as cases of bribery, fraud and other inappropriate or illegal conduct, to our whistleblower scheme or through our management system.
In 2019, three substantiated cases of inappropriate or unlawful behaviour were reported through our whistleblower scheme. Two cases concerned violation of good business conduct policies, and one case concerned conflict of interest between a third party representative and Ørsted. The cases had consequences for the individuals involved. None of the reported cases were critical to our business or impacted our financial results.
Whistleblower cases are taken very seriously, and we continuously enhance the awareness around good business conduct, e.g. through education and awareness campaigns to minimise similar cases in future.
Our taxes paid in Denmark for 2019 were affected by the completed construction agreement related to the Hornsea 1 Offshore Wind Farm in the UK. We have made significant investments in offshore wind farms in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands, resulting in the accumulation of large tax assets in recent years. Accordingly, we have not paid significant taxes in these countries prior to 2019. This is changing, as the offshore wind farms are being commissioned and are generating positive tax results, resulting in paid taxes in the UK and in Germany. We expect to start paying corporate tax in the Netherlands in 2021.
We are currently making significant investments in the US, and we do therefore not expect to pay any material corporate income tax in the foreseeable future. We are also making material investments in Taiwan, and we expect to start paying corporate tax in 2022/2023.
More details about tax can be found in section 5 ‘Tax’ in the annual report.
Accounting policies. 
Substantiated whistleblower cases Ørsted's whistleblower hotline is available for internal and external reporting of suspected cases of inappropriate or illegal behaviour. Whistleblower cases are received and handled by the Internal Audit function, which also receives similar reports through the management system and from compliance officers. All reports are managed in accordance with the guidelines for the handling of whistleblower reports approved by the Audit & Risk Committee, which is ultimately responsible for the whistleblower scheme. Only cases, which are closed during the financial year, and which have been reported to the Audit & Risk Committee as fully or partially substantiated, are reported in the ESG statement. Cases transferred to the police are defined as the number of cases reported in accordance with the above which are transferred to the police.
Course in good business conduct The number of employees who have completed a course in good business conduct is calculated as the proportion of employees at 31 December who have completed an e-learning course in good business conduct relative to the number of employees invited to take the course.
Green bonds The net proceeds from green financing instruments can be allocated to the financing, or re-financing (up to 2 years after COD), of a pool of eligible projects, including the acquisition, development and construction of eligible projects.
Avoided emissions from allocated green bond proceeds are calculated assuming that the future power generation from the projects in question replaces an equal amount of fossil fuel-based power generation.
Tax Accounting policy can be found in section 5 'Tax' in our 2019 annual report.

We are in the proces of updating our supplier assessment reporting framework to include assessments beyond RPP. From 2020, we will include all environmental assessments in the data set.
4.5 Responsible partner programme. 
Screenings and assessments are subject to the time schedule of the individual projects and the procurement priorities from year to year.
The 18% increase in the number of pre-qualification screenings from 2018 to 2019 was driven by a roll-out of the pre-qualification process to all procurement categories. In addition, we are piloting the pre-qualification screenings in new strategic markets.
The 116% increase in the number of risk screenings was mainly a result of increased business activities (signed contracts) in 2019.
The number of extended risk screenings remain stable because the increased number of signed contracts are with low-risk suppliers or suppliers that have already been screened or assessed.
The number of self-assessments and comprehensive assessments increased in 2019 compared to 2018 by 54% and 64%, respectively, both due to more assessments of potential suppliers and of sub-suppliers in areas where labour and human rights risks are considered to be higher.
We only open improvement plans with contracted suppliers. Therefore, assessed suppliers that are not awarded a contract, are not required to develop improvement plans. Consequently, the number of improvement plans opened did not increase with the same rate as the number of assessments.
Accounting policies. 
The responsible business partner programme (RPP) has been integrated into our procurement department's supplier contract screenings from 2015.
The programme applies a risk-based due diligence framework to identify areas within our code of conduct where relevant suppliers need to improve their adherence to the code.
Screenings We do risk screenings on all sourcing contracts above DKK 3 million. Based on the risk screening evaluation, we conduct extended risk screenings of selected suppliers, where additional parameters are included. Furthermore, additional extended screening procedures are carried out for all fuel suppliers as well as for top-spend suppliers.
Assessments Based on the results from the extended screenings, several suppliers are asked to complete a self- assessment questionnaire, and/or we decide to conduct a comprehensive assessment which often includes a visit to their production facilities.
Improvement plans Based on the results of the assessment, an improvement plan is developed, covering all findings from the assessment.

5. Auditor's report and calculation factors 40 Limited Assurance Report on the consolidated ESG statements 41 Calculation factors Ørsted ESG perfomance report 2019 Contents


To the stakeholders of Ørsted A/S Ørsted A/S engaged us to provide limited assurance on the data described below and set out in the Company’s consolidated environment, social and governance performance report for the period 1 January - 1 December 2019 (consolidated ESG performance report).
Our conclusion Based on the procedures we performed and the evidence we obtained, nothing came to our attention that causes us not to believe that data marked with a ' ' in the consolidated ESG performance report are free of material misstatements and prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting policies as stated on pages 9-38.
This conclusion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of our report.
What we are assuring The scope of our work was limited to assurance over data marked with a ' ' in the consolidated 2019 Ørsted ESG performance report for the period 1 January - 31 December 2019.
Professional standards applied and level of assurance We performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (revised) ‘Assurance Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information’. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the 5.1 Limited Assurance Report on the consolidated ESG statements risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.
Our independence and quality control We have complied with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which includes independence and other ethical requirements founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. The firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control, including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Our work was carried out by an independent multi-disciplinary team with experience in sustainability reporting and assurance.
Understanding reporting and measurement methodologies Data and information marked with a ' ' need to be read and understood together with the accounting policies on pages 9-38, which management are solely responsible for selecting and applying. The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities and over time.
Work performed We are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material misstatement of the data in scope of our assurance engagement. In doing so and based on our professional judgement, we: – conducted interviews with Group functions to assess consolidation processes, use of company- wide systems and controls performed at Group level; – performed an assessment of materiality and the selection of topics for the consolidated ESG performance report for the period 1 January - 31 December 2019; – conducted analytical review of the data and trend explanations submitted by all business units for consolidation at Group level; – evaluated the evidence obtained.
Management's responsibilities Management of Ørsted A/S is responsible for: – designing, implementing and maintaining internal control over information relevant to the preparation of data in the consolidated ESG performance report that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; – establishing objective accounting policies for preparing data; – measuring and reporting data in the consolidated ESG performance report based on the accounting policies; and – the content of the consolidated ESG performance report for the period 1 January - 31 December 2019.
Our responsibility We are responsible for: – planning and performing the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether data marked with a ' ' for the period 1 January - 13 December 2019 are free from material misstatements and are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting policies; – forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained – reporting our conclusion to the stakeholders of Ørsted A/S.
