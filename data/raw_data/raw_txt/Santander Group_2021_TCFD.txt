Our approach. 
By fulflling our purpose to help people and businesses prosper, we grow as a business and can help society address its challenges.
“The world is still heading for a temperature rise in excess of 3°C this century, far beyond the 1.5°C warming limit set by the Paris Agreement. If we don’t stop that from happening, the consequences for the world will be profound.
This is, therefore, an emergency. The good news is that it’s not too late to avoid it, but must act now and quickly. The progress we make in the next decade will be absolutely key.
As one of the world’s largest banks, we have a responsibility to help people and businesses cut emissions, and support the transition to the green economy.”
Ana Botín, Group executive chairman.

Introduction. 
Introduction. 
The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which assesses climate change data, estimated that heat-trapping emissions from human activities have raised global temperatures approximately 1°C above the pre-industrial (1850 – 1900) average. They will likely exceed the critical 1.5°C mark by 2052 — by as early as 2030 if current greenhouse gas (GHG) emission rates continue —, putting global warming on track to 4°C by the end of the century.
The models explaining the future of climate by level of warming show material diferences between the present day and global averages between 1.5ºC and 2ºC. There is scientifc evidence of changes1 in the climate system that are causing or will cause some of the following impacts and high-confdence risks on natural and human systems:
Impact of global warming → Impacts on organisms and ecosystems, as well as on human systems and well-being.
→ Increases in both land and ocean temperatures, more frequent heat waves in most land regions; and an increase in the frequency and duration of marine heatwaves.
→ Overshooting temperatures posing larger risks like the loss of some ecosystems.
→ Wider temperature extremes could put 420 million people frequently exposed to extreme heat waves, and about 65 million people being exposed to exceptional heat waves.
→ Multiple and compound climate-related risks are projected to increase, with higher rates proportions of people both exposed and susceptible to poverty in Africa and Asia.
→ The ocean has absorbed signifcant amount of anthropogenic carbon dioxide, resulting in ocean acidifcation that would impact a wide range of marine organisms and ecosystems.
Climate change is a recognized global issue, with causes and efects that transcend borders. It has become a focal point for such multilateral policymaking initiatives as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in efect since 1992.
Parties at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP) of the UNFCCC in Paris adopted the Paris Agreement in December 2015 to fght climate change with quick action and investment to achieve a sustainable low-carbon future to limit warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue eforts to keep the increase at 1.5°C. The Paris Agreement binds each signatory to nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and to a commitment to strengthening their eforts over the years. Thus, under the Paris Agreement, all signatories should update and submit their NDCs every fve years.

Introduction. 
The next round of nationally determined contribution submissions are due in 2021 at the COP 26 in Glasgow. Many leading countries are pledging ambitious plans — and legislation — to reduce emissions. However, the UNFCCC calls for greater measures to keep the global warming within the 1.5ºC threshold and avert a total climate disaster. Accordingly, net anthropogenic CO2 emissions would need to decline worldwide by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 in order to reach net zero by 2050. More than 130 countries have committed to carbon neutrality2, already being refected in recent policy statements by governments.
The World Bank, in a report from October 2019, stated that countries would have to invest about €75 trillion by 2030 in energy, transport, building and water infrastructure to build a sustainable economy. Creating an opportunity for banks to help build a more sustainable and resilient world.
The transition to a low-carbon resilient economy has to be fair and considerate of social, environmental and economic factors as well as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A UNFCCC3 report details how most of the parties had linked their NDC plans to SDGs.
The European Green Deal promotes plans to cut emissions by 55% from 1990 levels by 2030, in line with the net-zero goal for 2050. It will become legally binding once the Climate Law Regulation passes, which EU Member States must transpose into national legislation.
As a response to the Covid-19 pandemic the European Union provides the largest public stimulus package ever fnanced in Europe to boost the recovery, (over €2 trillion including the EU’s long-term budget, and the extraordinary temporary instrument NextGenerationEU) aiming to mitigate the economic and social impact of the coronavirus pandemic and make European economies and societies more sustainable, resilient and better prepared for the challenges and opportunities of the green and digital transitions. Al least 30% of the EU funds will be spent to fght climate change.
Climate change in banking sector. 
Increasingly banking regulations and requirements refect climate change and environmental risk. The UK’s Prudential Regulatory Authority is set to launch climaterelated risks stress testing in June 2021, with fndings due in the frst quarter of 2022. Also in 2022, the ECB will conduct its next supervisory stress test on climate-related risks, and the frst disclosure obligations under the EU Sustainable Finance Taxonomy will come into force.
Investors, shareholders and other important stakeholders are calling on banks and other companies to help boost market confdence by disclosing the climate-change risks they manage. Many are pursuing net-zero objectives and adapting operations to the Paris Agreement.
Under the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), Santander is a founding signatory of the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) with 45 other banks. It is a forum for leaders of fnancial institutions to accelerate the net-zero transition. Santander Asset Management also joined the global Net Zero Asset Managers initiative with more than 120 other signatories. Both initiatives are part of an umbrella alliance that brings net-zero fnance initiatives under one sector-wide strategic forum, The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), launched by Mark Carney in which Santander is also directly engaged.
Relevant stakeholders are calling on banks to help boost market confdence by disclosing and managing climate change risk. 
Disclosure recommendations. 
Disclosing our approach is key to helping markets and other stakeholders assess how we incorporate climate within our processes and policies and report on our climate performance. Key stakeholders increasingly share similar expectations regarding best practices for bank climate disclosures.
Supporting the Task force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) since 2017, we structure and base our Climate Finance report on its recommendations and framework for disclosure. The following chapters detail our progress across TCFD four pillars: Strategy, Governance, Risk Management, Metrics and Targets.

Our ambition. 
Banco Santander is fully committed to playing our part to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement while supporting our customers and economy. Our group-wide ambition is to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. This applies to the group’s operations (which have been carbon neutral since 2020) and emissions from our lending, advisory and investment services.
Starting with the climate-material sectors in our portfolio, we are committed to aligning our power generation portfolio with the Paris Agreement goals by 2030. In our fnance operations, our two initial decarbonization i) transition operational and attributable greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from lending and investment portfolios towards pathways to net-zero by mid-century.
ii) set intermediate targets for 2030 (or sooner) in respect of priority GHG-emitting sectors.
iii) prioritize client engagement with products and services that facilitate their needed transition in the real economy.
This report sets out our initial specifc decarbonization targets for the power targets set concerning high emitting activities are: i) ending fnancial services to power generation customers with over 10% of revenues coming from thermal coal by 2030; and ii)cutting our exposure to thermal coal mining to zero by 2030.
In April 2021, we became a founding member of the Net Zero Banking Alliance (under the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative). It sets out to: generation sector, measured on GHG, and established in two timeframes, 2025 and 2030.
See “Aligning our portfolio to meet the Paris agreement goals” section, Chapter 5. 
We’re integrating climate within our governance, strategy and risk management. We’ve set out courses of action and reviewed procedures and targets to transition our climate-material portfolios to net zero by 2050.

Our strategy. 
Climate change is a global challenge that requires everyone’s commitment and engagement. At Santander, we want to play our part in supporting our 148 million customers and the economy on our journey to become net zero by 2050 for a greener, more sustainable world.
We will ofer our customers decarbonization solutions that will help them fulfl their own climate goals. We will also make sure our portfolios align with the Paris Agreement Goals; and keep our operations carbon-neutral. Integrating climate within our risk management is key to tracking our plan’s robustness. Therefore, we have a four-pronged climate strategy and public commitments to: (1) align our portfolio with the Paris Agreement Goals and set sector- portfolio alignment targets in accordance with the NZBA and with the Net Zero Assets Manager initiative: we will align on our portfolios to ensure the projected carbon emissions are in line with limiting to a 1.5C temperature increase compared to pre-industrial levels.
See “Aligning our portfolio to meet the Paris agreement goals” section, Chapter 5 (2) help customers transition to a low carbon economy, with the commitment to raise EUR 120bn in green fnance between 2019 and 2025 and EUR 220bn by 2030; ofering our 148 million customers guidance, advice and specifc business solutions. Moreover, enable our clients to invest according to their sustainability preferences with a full ESG investment ofer available.
See Chapter 6 (3) reduce our impact on the environment to remain carbon neutral and source electricity from renewable energy by 2025.
See “Reducing our environmental footprint” section, Chapter 5 (4) embed climate into risk management: understanding and managing the sources of climate change risks in our portfolios and setting the courses of action and processes to manage it.
See Chapter 4. 
Santander Asset Management strategy. 
Santander Asset Management has joined the global Net Zero Asset Managers initiative as part of its commitment to fghting climate change. Operating in 10 countries, it aims to have net zero greenhouse gas emissions from the assets we manage by 2050, and is the only Spanish asset manager to join the initiative. This is consistent with Santander’s push for leadership in sustainability and the Group commitment to be net zero emissions by 2050.
Santander Asset Management commitments to reach in Net Zero by 2050 → Commitment #1: 50% emissions reduction by 2030 → Commitment #2: Measure portfolio greenhouse emissions → Commitment #3: Create the climate-related investment products our clients want → Commitment #4: Defne the climate stewardship and engagement strategy → Commitment #5: Disclose annual progress with our Net Zero pledge

Strategy. 
Climate risks and opportunities. 
We consider the two primary types of climate change-related risks: physical and transition.
Physical risks from climate change can be acute (event-driven) or chronic (longer-term) and tend to materialize in the medium-to-long term: • Acute physical risks include more severe natural disasters, such as coastal foods, droughts, heat waves, heavy precipitation, foods, landslides, hurricanes/cyclones, and storm surges, water scarcity and stress, and wildfres.
• Chronic physical risks include extreme precipitation and weather shifts, higher average temperatures, chronic heat waves and higher sea levels.
Physical risks may have these fnancial impacts: • Lower revenues owing to transport problems, supply chain disruption and other things that strain production; • Lower revenues and higher costs owing to workers’ health, safety, absenteeism and other workforce-related problems; • Write-ofs and early retirement of assets owing to property damage and “high-risk” locations; • Higher operating costs (e.g., inadequate water supply for hydroelectric plants or to cool nuclear and fossil fuel plants); • Wind pattern shifts that reduce energy production; • Agricultural damage; • Higher capital costs (e.g., damage to facilities); • Lower revenues from declining sales; • Higher insurance premiums and less insurance for assets in “high-risk” locations.
Transition risks arise from policymaking, technology, market sentiment changes and reputation in response to climate change: • Government policymaking and action can give rise to higher operating costs for carbonintensive customers; reporting obligations (data collection), especially on emissions (e.g. scope 3) and green taxonomy disclosures; and new EU directives on fnancial reporting; potential prudential treatment for high carbonrelated exposures, which could also raise fnancing costs for customers. These impacts appear in a short-to-medium term.
• Technological advances in renewable energy, energy storage, energy efciency, and carbon capture and storage to aid the transition to a low-carbon economy could render companies’ systems obsolete and make them less competitive in the medium-to-long term.
• Market sentiment can impact on supply and demand in the medium-to-long term as customer preferences, companies’ sales mix, energy pricing and asset revaluation change.
• Reputation can mean a prompt drop in demand for the goods and services of discredited sectors and companies.
Grupo Santander’s risk management has tools and techniques to recognize, monitor and mitigate ESG risks early, especially climate risk. The chart in the following page summarizes pre-mitigation of climate risk under various categories:

Climate risks and opportunities identifed in Santander Asset Management. 
Santander Asset Management is exposed to many asset types and sectors, and has a duty to always act in the long-term interests of our clients. We have assessed the climate change risks in each sector and included them in our extra fnancial ESG analysis.
Similarly, the transition to a lower-carbon economy will require signifcant investment, generating new opportunities.
The 3 top climate-related risks considered in our proprietary ESG analysis model are: → Regulatory risks such as the increasing price of GHG emissions; → Technology risks linked to more efcient lowcarbon technology alternatives; and → Market risks resulting from increased costs and a shift in consumer demands, which could result in stranded assets, increased operating costs, reduced demand for products and services and increased cost of, and reduced availability to, capital.
The 3 top climate-related opportunities embedded in within our analysis model are: → Development of products and services earmarked as climate solutions that could entail diversifcation, greater competitive advantage and increased revenue; → Provision of lower-emission energy sources that could beneft from less exposure to GHG emissions, reduced costs, supportive policy incentives and reputational benefts; and → Resource efciency through better production and distribution to reduce operational costs, increase production capacity and increase the value of fxed assets.

Strategy Governance. 
Scenario analysis and resilience of Santander’s strategy. 
Grupo Santander is embedding climate change risk management in 1-year budgeting, 3-year planning, overall strategic planning, the ICAAP/ ILAAP and the Recovery & Resolution Plan. One of our main tools is scenario analysis, and we’re developing a framework that integrates in-house elements with Planetrics, an external vendor tool by Vivid Economics that quantifes the fnancial impacts of physical and transition risks from climate change on each counterparty. Climate scenarios describe plausible future pathways and allow investors to understand the impact of climate change on their portfolios. Planetrics, modelling methodology translates climate scenarios into economic shocks and models real asset and fnancial impacts.
It comprises seven modules: 1. Scenario selection: choosing appropriate climate scenario (described below).
2. Scenario expansion and country downscaling: modelling the impact of global scenarios into a range of variables at country and sector level.
3. Physical risk impact: capturing the fnancial impact of extreme weather events and longerterm shifts in climate patterns.
4. Transition risk impact: capturing the changing patterns in demand (e.g. increase in low-

Grupo Santander is planning to use that framework for management, regulatory and supervisory needs. Earlier this year, the SSM announced it would run climate stress testing in 2022 and started to design its methodology to assess transition risk and physical risk for expected losses over 3 years (short term) and 30 years (long term), up to 2050. Stress testing will cover credit, market, reputational and operational risks, and require the fnancial entities to provide revenues, exposure and emissions from relevant sectors, as well as how prepared some entity’s climate-scenario analysis framework is. Santander’s subsidiaries are also participating in local stress tests conducted by each country’s competent authority.

First, Santander UK defned a target operating model based on scenario modelling requirements, process mapping and designated responsibilities. The bank then performed a dry run on physical and transition risks from mortgages, corporate exposures, social housing counterparties, sovereign bonds, index-linked gilts and supranational agency exposures in Q1 2021, which tested the process, assessed data; and provided scenario modelling training to the teams involved in stress testing exercise; and covered transition impacts on the residual value of Santander Consumer UK vehicles.
For Santander UK’s Retail Mortgage portfolio (which accounts for more than 60% of the Grupo Santander’s mortgages), it analysed physical and transition risks under diferent scenarios, which included business-as-usual (average of 3.7°C by 2100) and low-carbon transition (trends towards 2°C of warming). We provided Landmark with the property addresses and balance of our 1.2 million retail mortgages. Having considered fooding, subsidence and coastal erosion, we drew the conclusion that physical risks from our mortgage portfolio are very low. In particular, 95% of our mortgaged properties have negligible or very low risk from fooding, the most signifcant risk (see table next).
Number Flood RiskC of properties %
High; >1:30 2,906 0.24. 
Medium: between 1:30 and 1:100 10,021. 
Low; >1:1000 49,678 4.02. 
Very low; >1:10,000 69,523 5.63. 
Negligible ; <1;10,000 1,102,435 89.3. 
Total Properties 1,234,563 100.00. 
C. Flood Risk is expressed as a ratio, where 1 in 30 year (1:30) food event refers to the likelihood of fooding occurring in a given year.
Our analysis also considered a transition risk scenario that required properties to improve their energy efciency rating to C-grade.
Santander UK is working on climate change scenario modelling; outreach to learn our customers’ mitigation and adaptation plans; and staf training. Irrespective of CBES, Santander UK has a plan to continue embedding climate change in management processes.
Santander’s Economic Research Department analyses the economic impact of climate change based on the scenarios published by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and other external sources (like the IEA - Net Zero scenario we used for Portfolio Alignment.)
See “Aligning our portfolio to meet the Paris agreement goals” section, Chapter 5. 
With internal assumptions, to create feasible scenarios and data including GDP, energy consumption and emissions. In exploring the impacts of climate change, the NGFS, which is becoming a standard in the industry, provides a common framework and starting point for bespoke scenario pathways, which allow stakeholders to explore transition risks, as well as physical risks.
The next fgure shows the conceptual representations of the diferent scenario sets (NGFS - Climate Scenarios Framework):

The board’s responsible banking, sustainability and culture committee (RBSCC) reviews and challenges climate change strategy and other environmental considerations. It’s an advisory body that assists the board with overseeing the climate change components of the responsible banking strategy, leading to more informed board decisions and enhanced strategic focus based on the related risks and opportunities. The RBSCC comprises fve independent board members and meets at least quarterly. Members are appointed on the back of their knowledge, qualifcations and experience in the areas under the committee’s remit.
Of its four meetings in 2020, three had climate change on the agenda. In the frst half of 2021, the RBSCC reviewed climate change topics three times, with additional discussions planned before the end of the year.
The committee discussed climate change project updates; climate-related fnancial risks and opportunities; roadmaps to fulfl TCFD and ECB expectations; fulflment of the bank’s net zero commitments; Santander’s sustainable fnance proposition to help our customers’ transition to a low-carbon economy; plans for business lines; and the progress of our carbon footprint and green fnance commitments.
To streamline our governance, we created a responsible banking forum (RB Forum) by merging the former responsible banking culture steering and inclusive & sustainable banking steering groups. Its purpose is to drive the responsible banking agenda across the Group at executive level; to meet and refresh public commitments; facilitate management alignment on key issues; discuss and escalate matters to the RBSCC; and ensure the execution of RBSCC mandates. The Forum meets at least six times per year and reviews the climate change strategy/net zero ambition before discussion at the RBSCC. The Forum’s 11 permanent executive and non executive members are the regional head of Europe (rotating chair); regional head of North America (rotating chair); regional head of South America (rotating chair); group head of Strategy, Corporate Development & Financial Planning; group head of Human Resources; group chief risk ofcer; group chief compliance ofcer; global head of Wealth Management & Insurance; global head of Santander Corporate and Investment Banking; group head of Communications, Corporate Marketing and Research; and senior advisor on responsible business practices to the executive chairman. As at June 2021, the RB Forum has held two meetings and addressed such climate-related topics as net zero strategy, sustainable fnance and carbon ofsetting.

Governance. 
The group management committee, chaired by the CEO, receives progress reports on the responsible banking agenda twice a year and on climate change four times per year.
Specialist working groups cascade Santander’s climate change agenda, including TCFD implementation, supervisors’ expectations, climate commitments and governance, throughout the Group. The climate project/ working group, co-led by SCIB, Risk, and Responsible Banking with members from several functions and geographies, meets weekly to monitor and drive progress according to the climate change project roadmap; monthly with the corporate areas involved to ensure headway; and quarterly with all subsidiaries and areas.
ESG training for SCIB and for WM&I. 
In 2021 we created our ESCC training course on the implementation of the European Banking Authority Guidelines on Loan Origination and Monitoring. The main objective was to present Santander´s latest work on climate change and show the 128 attendees how to embed climate change in the SCIB customer risk assessment. In 2020, our Private Banking bankers and advisers (over 1,100 experts), received a special ESG training.
The project has an Climate Steering Group that meets each two months, and is composed by the group chief credit ofcer, the global head of enterprise wide risk management, the chief of staf to the global head of Santander Corporate and Investment Banking, the global head of responsible banking, the head of the chairman’s ofce, the deputy director of group strategy and the senior advisor on responsible business practices to the executive chairman; and receives feedback from executive directors as part of the RB Forum.
The Group has also embedded climate components through the following governance:
Climate training for the Board. 
On November 2020, the board of directors participated in a second climate change training programme that included modules on the Paris Agreement and Net Zero. The Santander UK board and executive committee attended a climate change workshop delivered by external experts, which covered climate science, regulatory requirements and TCFD recommendations.
• Board approval of the 2021 executive remuneration scheme. Responsible Banking forms part of the qualitative adjustment to the short-term metrics. The Responsible Banking scorecard considers progress against the bank’s RB agenda and specifcally includes climate change.
• In 2020, the board strategy committee approved the climate change project as one of the bank’s strategic initiatives. Progress is reviewed twice a year according to the established roadmap.
• In Q1 2020, the Risk division completed a review of its climate change governance that looked at the terms of reference of governing. 
Training for risk analysts. 
In March 2021 we held a CDP-sponsored workshop on climate change for risk analysts, with over 182 attendees who discussed the physical and transition risks of climate change.
A follow-up CDP webinar on climate change, held in April with around 80 attendees, delved deeper into the TCFD´s reporting standards and recommendations.
bodies, their forward-looking agendas and the risk framework. In the annual review, it reexamined all policies and internal procedures, and introduced specifc references to climate change risk management.
• In 2020, we also included climate information in our three-year fnancial plan and through our green fnance targets and other business metrics.
Policies The general sustainability policy, which was updated in 2020 and the environmental, social & climate change risk management policy (that outlines climate-specifc lending criteria), includes climate change considerations.
Climate dialogues. 
We launched “Climate Dialogues”, for senior managers to discuss critical climate-related topics with renowned experts. In 2020 we held three sessions, with up to 940 participants in a single session. The programme continues on a bimonthly basis throughout 2021. So far, we’ve had six sessions with: Ivan Glasenberg (Glencore CEO), Lord Nicholas Stern (Grantham Research Institute and London School of Economics), Claire O’Neill (WBCSD, Managing Director, Climate & Energy), Alzbeta Klein (IFC Director and Global Head of Climate Business), Andy Marsh (President and CEO of Plug Power Inc) and Håkan Samuelsson (President and Chief Executive Volvo Cars).

Key processes. 
I Planning: setting business objectives and considering business environment. 
II Identifcation: ensuring efective categorization and control. 
III Assessment: determining the likelihood, impact and materiality of risk. 
IV Execution: managing risk profle within the limits agreed in the planning. 
V Monitoring: comparing perfomance against agreed plans. 
VI Mitigation: bringing perfomance back within or towards acceptable levels. 
VII Reporting: production and submission of accurate and relevant management information. 
Grupo Santander’s Corporate Risk Framework contemplates physical and transition risk from climate change due to their potential impact on other risks in the medium and long term.
This framework also establishes the key processes for managing a given risk to which Grupo Santander is exposed.
Climate risk is embedded in these key processes:
I. Planning. 
We shape our strategy with tools that help us understand our business environment; prioritize business and risk decisions on climate risk; and monitor our progress on internal and external commitments as well as on our stakeholders’ expectations. The climate strategy is further explained in section 2.
II. Identifcation. 
Risk identifcation comprises the Risk Profle Assessment (RIA/RPA) and the Top Risk exercise.
For the Risk Profle Assessment (RIA/RPA), Grupo Santander performs a routine assessment of all risk types to evaluate its risk profle systematically and objectively. The Risk Profle Assessment (RPA) reveals the organization’s overall risk exposure by unit and risk type or for the entire group management of deviation of risk levels; and threats to the group’s business plan or strategic objectives.
RPA methodology consists of three blocks: • Risk performance: assesses the Group’s risk exposure level based on metrics that are unique for each risk type but common within all units.
• Control environment: assesses the risk management according to a Target Operating Model (TOM), regulatory requirements and best market practices.
• Forward-looking approach: potential threats to business planning and strategic goals.
The RPA helps monitor our risk profle consistently across units and recognize where risk management fails to apply best practices and target operating models. In 2021, we ran a climate change control environment questionnaire to assess control standards; we will consider its fndings in our 2022 RPA.

Risk Management. 
Risk teams across the group will keep track of potential gaps.
Our Top Risk exercise addresses risks to the group’s three-year fnancial plan and longterm strategic plan. In this bottom-up process between the headquarters and the subsidiaries (which is subject to quarterly review and monitoring), top risks are identifed by our frst line of defence and then challenged by our second line of defence to inform key strategic processes and serve as input for idiosyncratic scenarios in the ICAAP, the ILAAP and the group’s recovery plan. Since 2018, the Top Risk exercise has covered climate risk. The approach has evolved from mainly regulatory driven to a more holistic perspective. As climate change data and methodologies progress (including scenario analysis and stress testing), inputs will become less qualitative to more quantitative.
III. Assessment. 
Grupo Santander recurrently performs a materiality assessment, which covers the group’s main material ones, identifying the most climate material portfolios. Our materiality assessment, which plots each sector’s transition and physical climate-related risks on a fvepoint scale to measure its materiality to the group’s balance sheet, enables us to manage the emergence and concentration of climate change risks by sector. It is critical in defning our strategy and priorities.
Methodology. 
Build a Taxonomy of sectors. 
Based on UNEP-FI TCFD guidelines Including physical and transition risks. 
Grupo Santander follows UNEP-FI guidelines and uses a top-down application of climate risk heat map per sector and geography.
The assessment covers climate-related risks to material and non-material businesses over specifc time horizons, in order to address them into the group’s management processes such as risk appetite, top risks, credit limits and stress tests. It treats climate risk as an aspect of regular balance-sheet risks (especially credit risk) because of how it can exacerbate expected losses and raise probability of default from customers.
Risk taxonomy and heat maps form the basis for a qualitative classifcation of portfolios and their potential exposure to climate risks. They are. 
Calculate Exposures of portfolio. 
Estimation of Santander exposures for portfolio in scope (Red-Amber-Green) classifcation (from low to very high) to rate physical and transition risks for each sector: (see following page)
Assess vulnerabilities with a Heat Map 5-levels scale to assess vulnerability of each sector to physical and transition risks designed to capture the value chain of economic activities, regardless of their original NACE classifcation. The internal climate change risk taxonomy recognizes sectors directly exposed to physical and transition climate risks. It incorporates sectors based on guidelines issued by the Task Force for Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), of which Santander is an active member.
The heat map of physical and transition risks provides a starting point to understand overall risk. Indicates the degree of an sector’s potential fnancial risk either based on its exposure to physical risk or a “rapid” and “disorderly” transition to a low-carbon economy. It uses RAG

Transition Risk. 
Sector has low emissions intensity, is not reliant on fossil fuel, and is closer to achieving a net zero position in relation to other sectors.
Sector has lower per unit emissions relative to others, and is less carbon-intensive. A much lower level of investment is needed to transition to net zero. Sector is unlikely to be impacted signifcantly by changes in consumer sentiment or policy.
Material investment is needed to transition to net zero. Sector will experience some impact from changing customer sentiment and will be more exposed to policy and technological changes.
Sector has higher emissions per unit of production relative to others and will experience adverse demand responses. Sector warrants targeted low-carbon policy, technological innovation, and/or investment to transition to net zero.
Sector is heavily fossil fuel reliant. Signifcant investment needed to transition and targeted policy intervention required. Focus on action from a wider range of stakeholders. Increased risk of premature write-downs on assets. Net zero position still unclear, indicating a longer transition.
First, the materiality assessment reviewed the group’s balance sheet in relation to its loan book covering SCIB, Corporates, Retail Individuals, Santander Consumer Finance, Private Banking, Institutions, Retail SME, and Wealth Management & Insurance, focusing on climate risk by sector and geography. That enabled us to select the most adequate methodology to evaluate impacts and prioritize a roll-out plan.
We use materiality assessment fndings as inputs to monitor, measure and report on fnancial impacts and develop new metrics for risk management, credit policies and business strategy.
Santander is adapting policies and processes, and running courses on climate change to enhance risk management and our business model, and to seize opportunities relating to climate risks. We’re committed to aiding our customers’ green transition. We base decisions on internal reporting about risks and opportunities in the short, medium and long term.
Our materiality assessment covers more than the 80% of our balance sheet, with a deep analysis of fnancial loss from loan defaults or credit quality deterioration. We also put such other risk factors as residual value, strategic, market and liquidity risks under close analysis.

We’ve extended our materiality assessment on a progressively approach. We’re including now more sectors and segments from the materiality assessment shown in the 2020 Annual Report, where we shown SCIB customers from the most concerning sectors. The current identification includes also other climate relevant sectors as well as individuals, SCF and corporates customers.
Santander Consumer Finance (SCF) is a good example of how we assess a distinct type of business. To include it in the materiality assessment, we grouped its exposures and analysed them. However, as SCF has businesses that are particularly afected by climate (such as auto lending), we ran a special assessment considering four traditional risk types: credit risk, residual value risk, reputational risk and strategic/business model risk. We split SCF’s portfolio by auto loans, consumer loans, exposures secured by mortgages and corporate loans, screened each segments on a 5-level risk scale (very high, high, medium, moderate, low). Our analysis considered regulatory environment, mitigating actions and consumer sentiment as well as more precise aspects like low credit risk and residual value risk (mainly in light of the portfolio’s limited maturity and diversifcation). We concluded that SCF’s climate risk mainly stem from its retail auto lending, a segment that contributes signifcantly to the group’s proft and could be at risk in the future, if not managed properly. We also found auto fnancing business could have moderate reputational risk. Still, we expect the impact of these risks will materialize only in the mediumto-long term (in more than 5 years).
Our materiality assessment of SCF’s business model (mainly retail, good-quality, short-term and diversifed portfolios) found that credit risk would have no material impact from climate because average maturity (mainly for auto loans) is short and its climate risk score, based on external benchmarks and providers, was low.
We also conducted deeper business analyses with a similar methodology to consider each segment’s specifcities and behaviour in the short, medium and long term.
Santander is committed to implementing advanced risk classifcation. Our approach follows a bottom-up analysis, in which we consider each customer’s drivers, fnancial situation and technology. We also calculate quantitative impacts on probability of default based on climate scenarios to diferentiate customers on qualitative sector-subsector heat maps and class best positioned customers under the same subsector so we can recognize how strategical risk is evolving.

Risk Management. 
IV. Execution and monitoring. 
Santander’s risk appetite statement (RAS) determines the size and type of risks deemed prudent to its strategy, even under unexpected circumstances. Because the board sets it every year according to specifc limits and policies for each risk type, portfolio and segment, it is an efective management tool. In 2019, the RAS included a qualitative statement that linked climate change management to policies that placed restrictions on, or ended fnancing for, transactions bearing social and environmental risk in the energy, mining and metals, and soft commodities sectors (we review these policies annually to ensure our standards are consistent with best practices and our strategy). In 2020, we adapted our RAS and related policies in furtherance of our commitment to social causes, the environment and the Paris Agreement’s transition to a low-carbon economy. In 2021, the board approved additional amendments to the RAS, and we updated and merged our policies into our Environmental & Social Risk Management Policy.
Also, as part of the Net Zero Banking Alliance launched in April 2021, Santander will continue to set alignment targets for power, oil and gas, transport, mining and metals, and other carbonintensive sectors. Risk appetite continues to evolve to refect the Group’s strategy, as well as to the methodologies and data available aiming to include metrics in our 2022 RAS to limit our exposure to the most carbon-emitting sectors.
V. Mitigation. 
Our lending process contemplates risks from climate change. We’ve aligned our loan approval policies with EBA guidelines on loan origination and monitoring. We also assess socio-environmental and climatic risks from customers from sectors documented in the Climate Change fnancial risk guide to assess their impact on our loan book.
Our Wholesale Banking and Corporate & Commercial loan approval requires customers and transactions to meet certain criteria, which cover socio-environmental and climate change risks based on our corporate credit risk function’s Climate Change fnancial risk guide. In addition, we analyse project fnance transactions in the Wholesale Banking portfolio according to Equator Principles guidelines (which Grupo Santander adopted voluntarily in 2009) and the International Finance Corporation, as defned by socio-environmental risk function in Structured Finance team.
Our Environmental, Social & Climate Change Risk Management Policy dictates special environmental and social (E&S) risk screening for SCIB to approve fnancing based on the client’s management of socio-environmental and climate risk. It allows us to understand how our operations supported by products and services provided by Grupo Santander impact on the environment.
The frst-line business functions conduct proper due diligence by completing questionnaires. If this process reveals a reputational issue, they will report it to the Reputational Risk team for review. Our reputational risk model implements preventive risk management.
In addition, a cross-functional group has been set up at the corporate level to analyse controversies in a broad environment, including those related to climate change management and which could have an impact in terms of reputation.

Risk Management. 
Santander and the Brazilian Amazon. 
Protecting the Amazon rainforest is critical if we are to tackle climate change. Grupo Santander is committed to doing so, while helping promote sustainable development and practices.
Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has been taking place over several decades: logging, mining, property speculation, lack of clear land titles, large infrastructure projects in the region have all played a role.
In addition to the information available about Santander’s global policy on Environmental, Social & Climate Change Risk Management (link) (ESCC), and our commitment to the Equator Principles, we detail below the additional care Santander takes when lending to Brazilian clients with operations in the Amazon.
Our Global Policy Santander’s global ESCC policy obviously also applies to our activities in fnancing clients with operations in the Amazon. Our ESCC policy requires a special focus, among others, on the following activities: • Industrial processes with an environmental impact on nearby areas classifed as Ramsar Sites, World Heritage Sites or by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
• Extraction and sale of native tropical timber species.
• Forestry plantations in forests listed as protected by ofcial bodies.
Santander’s overall approach to the Brazilian Amazon For years, the bank has been working with them to promote sustainable development in the Amazon. Santander was the frst privatesector Brazilian bank to develop, in 2002, credit analysis that looked at environmental and social risk; and we were the frst, in 2016, to formally incorporate a sustainability rating into the credit rating of its Corporate segment clients. Since then, the bank has taken a number of further steps: • All loan requests by farmers and ranchers to Santander in Brazil are checked for embargoes issued because of illegal deforestation, and are screened to make sure that the properties do not overlap with ofcially-recognized indigenous peoples’ reserves and parks.
• Clients’ practices are reviewed regularly: there are annual ESG reviews of more than 2,000 customers, including beef processors, soy traders and logging companies.
Plano Amazônia In July 2020, Santander Brazil announced a plan to promote sustainable development in the Amazon, in collaboration with the two other largest private-sector banks in Brazil. Part of this plan, called Plano Amazônia, aims to eliminate deforestation in the supply chain of cattle for beef processors in the Amazon and is being implemented by Santander Brazil.
The Plano Amazônia also prioritizes other objectives: understanding the land ownership issue, and promoting the cultivation of local crops.
Farmers and ranchers As part of its credit approval for loans to farmers and ranchers, Santander retains a satellite-imaging frm that monitors 14,000 properties that it is fnancing or that are taken as collateral. This frm supplies us with daily information on embargoes issued by the government prohibiting production on specifc illegally-deforested plots, as well as incursions into ofcially-recognized indigenous lands and parks and conservation areas.
If there are problems, we will contact the client and require an explanation. If material breaches of environmental law and regulations are identifed, under the terms of our standard contract the bank has the power to take remedial action including, where applicable, declaring the early maturity of the debt and demanding its payment.
Environmental and social reviews of companies For corporate clients across Brazil, not just in the Amazon, Santander has a set of ESCC processes and controls that take into consideration if our clients are legally compliant and if they have good practices.
Over the past decade, Santander Brazil has conducted reviews of more than 2,000 corporate client groups a year, including those that have operations in the Amazon such as large soy producers, beef processors, logging companies, etc. Specifcally regarding reviews of beef producers, Santander has closely followed the implementation of their practices regarding their suppliers.
Once again, if material breaches of environmental law and regulations are identifed, under the terms of our standard contract the bank has the power to take remedial action including, where applicable, declaring the early maturity of the debt and demanding its payment.
Working with others to stop deforestation Santander was the frst bank in Brazil to require that native-species lumber companies to have the Forest Stewardship Certifcation (FSC) or equivalent certifcation to be a client.
Santander Brazil participates in three external initiatives that propose solutions to stop deforestation. It is a founder of The Round Table on Responsible Soy (RTRS), and were its frst president. The bank is also a founder and board member of the Brazilian Roundtable on Sustainable Livestock (GTPS, in Portuguese), a multi-stakeholder initiative to promote better ranching practices in Brazil. Santander Brazil is also active in the banking association’s (Febraban) committee on forestry/agribusiness issues.

Santander’s commitment to the Net Zero Banking Alliance. 
Santander aims to be net zero in carbon emissions in our own operations and fnanced customers’ emissions by 2050. We pledged in our 2020 Climate Report and 2020 Annual Report to reduce our carbon footprint, focusing initially on the most material sectors to climate risk like power generation and oil & gas. We’ve been publishing the PACTA analysis of our power generation portfolio since 2019.
As stand above, the pledges we made in our 2020 Annual Report to align our lending activity with the Paris Agreement included being net zero by 2050 and: i) aligning our power generation portfolio to the Paris Agreement ii) ending fnancial services to power generation customers with a revenue dependency on coal of over 10% by 2030; and iii) cutting our exposure to coal mining to zero by 2030.
In April 2021, Grupo Santander became a founding member of the Net Zero Banking. 
Alliance (NZBA). We committed to set and disclose decarbonization targets for most GHG intensive sectors.
This report details the methodology we use to set our power generation portfolio targets and how it enables us to monitor our commitments and embed climate risks in our fnancing decisions.
Emissions data challenges: a progressive approach. 
When setting portfolio alignment targets, the availability, quality and comparability of data is a challenge. There is still a lot to be done to improve how companies report GHG emissions and relevant activity data to enable stakeholders (including fnancial institutions) to analyse their climate performance.
Given the data gaps, therefore we developed a data hierarchy which combines the use of customer’s data, verifed external data sources and the use of proxies. We’ve reconciled the information as far as possible but acknowledge that disparities between reported sources and modelled emissions remain. We expect the gaps and inconsistencies to be reduced progressively as companies make progress on disclosing nonfnancial data.
At this stage, it’s important to have a good understanding of data quality to make sure we base decisions on solid information that will enable us to act on our fnanced emissions. That’s why we’re using the PCAF data quality score1 and will monitor its performance for each sector.
We calculated the quality score for our power generation portfolio using a conservative estimate that took data gaps into account. On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the highest quality, it scored 2.
1. PCAF – Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials: https://carbonaccountingfnancials.com/
The PCAF standard considers three emissions types: Option 1 – reported emissions (best option but barely available), option 2 – physical activity or estimated emissions (intermediate option, using some real data and estimated factors) and option 3 – economic activity emissions or unspecifc estimated emissions (lowest quality of data using average factors).

3) Estimate emissions baseline. Measure current portfolio fnanced emissions.
We‘ve started using and disclosing the fnanced emissions from our customers, following the PCAF standard. This means we can assess the GHG emissions linked to our portfolios and consequently devise alignment strategies.
Financed emissions must be accurate enough to gain a picture of our customers’ emissions and take stock of improvements along the pathway towards net zero. 4) Estimate inertial trajectory. Project portfolio emissions that take into account our customers’ announcements on emissions reduction targets, portfolio maturity profle, etc.
5) Determine targets and glidepath: a. Set interim targets based on science (using 2030 as the preferred option for an initial target) in line with the latest climate knowledge that will help us achieve the long-term goal of being Net Zero by 2050.
b. Defne the convergence approach towards the reference pathway to meet interim and fnal targets.
6) Identify levers to achieve targets: For each sector, and considering the composition of the bank’s portfolio, identify commercial steering levers to meet the target glidepath and size their impact and cost.
To draw up alignment strategies and practical decarbonization targets, we need emissions data and accurate estimates to monitor real progress. This data forms the basis of our engagement with customers to help them on their decarbonization journey. Helping our customers cut emissions is another fundamental component of our alignment strategy. We’re working with institutions and experts to increase our knowledge and capabilities, and to improve the current data and methodology available.
Reporting fnanced emissions goes hand in hand with an explanation of the methodology and assumptions made. In some cases, the recommended design choices for each sector or asset class consider the diferent components of the value chain and emissions scopes (1, 2 and 3), which occasionally makes it difcult to interpret and compare results accurately. For the same reason, reporting absolute emissions could be misleading if we fail to understand the diferent

Portfolio alignment for select material sectors. 
The most carbon-intensive sectors for Santander as identifed in the climate materiality assessment are power generation, oil & gas, transport and mining & metals. We’ve analysed how well our customers in those sectors are positioned in terms of current and expected emissions from their activities to align with the Net Zero pathway towards 2050.
This year we’ve enhanced our capabilities and tools for measuring and proposing alignment strategies for our portfolios and identifying the data required and where we can get it from (internal and external sources).
The methodology relies on fnancial information from our customers (total equity, total debt, total assets, company valuation, etc.), as well as emissions and production data. In the absence of public emissions data, the methodology requires calculating emissions estimates based on a proxy (average emissions by sector, country, etc.). Once we have an idea of our customers’ total fnanced emissions, we can attribute the emissions Santander actually fnanced by applying our attribution factor in line with the PCAF approach. This has been extraordinarily challenging given the limited emissions data available, as it is a relatively new priority for many sectors.
Portfolio alignment is a nascent feld for banks. We’ve decided to use a bespoke approach that considers the alternatives available to provide targets in line with our NZBA commitment. Following the initial approach with PACTA, we’re now focusing on the Sector Decarbonization Approach (SDA, one of the methodologies the Science Based Target initiative uses), Transition. 
Pathway Initiative (TPI) and PCAF as the main forms of calculating fnanced emissions.
The pandemic made 2020 an outlier in the performance of many fnancial metrics, not to mention economic and production activity in many sectors, we conducted the analysis based on 2019 fgures as we consider this data more reliable to measure the baseline and emissions of our portfolios.

Power generation:
Power generation is responsible for a signifcant part of the anthropogenic GHG emissions causing global temperatures to rise. The power sector relies on technological alternatives that produce very diferent levels of emissions: coal, oil and gas-fred power plants produce signifcantly high emissions as opposed to renewable energy sources (wind and solar). Therefore, the technology mix of our power generation clients – and of our portfolio – is very important.
We began by assessing how aligned our power generation portfolio was, using the PACTA methodology to analyse its technology mix, and published the results in our 2019 and 2020 annual reports. We’ve now estimated the current and future emissions of our power generation portfolio and proposed the frst GHG decarbonization targets for 2025 and 2030.
In setting our targets, we’ve taken into account the expected trajectory of our portfolio and how it compares with the latest recognized scenario to achieve net zero emissions by 2050: “International Energy Agency (IEA) – Net Zero Emissions” (see graph next). This scenario sets out the global pathway to net-zero emissions by 2050, for the energy sector.
We based the pathway on the SDA and the convergence ambition approach. The SDA assumes global convergence of key sectors’ emissions intensity by 2050. The convergence approach, rather than the trajectory, sets out the progressive reduction of the emission metric to meet the target along the pathway, even if it requires sharp falls to meet the scenario pathway.
Results show that the 2019 baseline was a good starting point, due to two factors: (i) Our long-lasting, worldwide leadership in renewable energy project fnance (which accounts for a signifcant amount of electricity generation with the cleanest and almost zeropollution technology), and (ii) Our current client base, with high exposure to corporate power generation customers that have a good generation technology mix and ambitious plans to decarbonize their activity.
Those two factors will stand us in good stead to achieve our long-term commitment and remain the leader among our peers all the way to 2030 and beyond.
As the chart on the right shows, the emissions intensity of our power generation portfolio is 0.23 tCO2e/MWh, based on 2019 portfolio data. Our commitment is to reduce to 0.18 tCO2e/MWh by 2025, and to 0.11 tCO2e/MWh by 2030, in line with the Paris Agreement.

Note: In our 2020 Annual Report we disclosed the physical emissions intensity of our corporate power generation portfolio as 309.6 grCO2/KWh. The diference lies within the progress we’ve made in reporting fnanced emissions on three fronts: i) incorporating corporate exposures and our 10.4Bn power generation project fnance portfolios; ii) increasing the scope of the portfolio analysis; and iii) using drawn amounts in accordance with PCAF methodology to calculate emissions as a better refection of our fnancing activity’s contribution to our customers’ emissions.

Metrics and Targets. 
Methodology: We have analysed the “upstream/generation” component of the value chain for the power sector since it’s the material sector with the most emissions.
The target metric we’ve used is emissions by physical intensity, measured in tons of CO2 equivalent per megawatt produced by hour. This metric is simple and widely-used, which aids benchmarking and monitoring. It is also our preferred choice due to its actionability, as it rewards emissions efciency improvements – our customers’ performance can be tracked over time using it, and because production needs to increase over time to support the electrifcation of the broader economy.
As far as the attribution factor is concerned, we’ve used the PCAF and SBTi -SDA recommended methodology to calculate fnanced emissions: (a) the drawn amounts for corporate lines of credit (as the best representation of our fnancing that contributes to their activity and therefore their emissions) and (b) the total commitment to Project Finance.
For the Santander attribution factor, we use fnancial information from internal databases or Capital IQ as an external source, when necessary.
44% of the exposure has been assessed using the Trucost1 data source with a PCAF score of 2; 40% has been estimated for project fnance renewable energy with a PCAF score of 2; for another 14% of the exposure, emissions data info was gathered directly from the annual reports, also resulting in a PCAF score of 2. The remaining 4% is of relatively lower quality with a PCAF score of 3.
Other material sectors: We have also made progress in our other three most material sectors: oil & gas, transport and mining & metals. We worked on an initial defnition of the proposed design variables to ensure alignment in each of those sectors, including the metrics to be used, the value chain focus, scopes, alignment methodologies and an understanding of our footprint in terms of fnanced emissions. We have to continue our analysis to confrm our alignment approach and, as with power, provide a target for each in line with the NZBA and set out an action plan to achieve it.

Roadmap for delivery on Net Zero. 
The ambition to have Net Zero emissions by 2050 in many sectors depends on several exogenous factors, with available data and methodologies the most crucial. In many cases, there is still a lot of room for improvement before we can use them as reliable tools to measure emissions and set decarbonization targets.
Under our climate risk materiality assessment, we identifed and analysed the potential physical and transition risks for each of the bank’s sectors and portfolios. This assessment enables us to prioritize our work while determining decarbonization strategies for each sector.
For the most concerning sectors identifed in the materiality assessment (power, oil & gas, mining & metals and transport), we’ve been progressing to measure the GHG emissions associated with our customers’ activities and the bank’s share of emissions, per PCAF guidelines indications. Those sectors are the ones considered to have more GHG emissions directly or indirectly linked to their activities and with more potential levers to reduce the emissions and contribute to the Paris Agreement goals.

Metrics and Targets. 
Subject to data and methodology availability, in line with our NZBA commitment and previous commitment as part of the Collective Commitment to Climate Action, we plan to set decarbonization targets based on emissions metrics for portfolios of the following sectors: oil & gas, mining & metals (coal-related) and transport by September 2022 or earlier in line with our NZBA commitment and previous commitment as part of the Collective Commitment to Climate Action. These decarbonization targets must be compatible with helping our customers transition to a greener economy.
We will set decarbonization targets for Santander Asset Management (SAM) by November 2021 to fulfl the commitment with the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative.
We will set decarbonization targets for mortgages, commercial real estate, auto loans, cement, agriculture and some sub-sectors by the end of March 2024.
Fossil fuels fnancing. 
The Banking on Climate Chaos: Fossil Fuel Finance Report 2021, endorsed by over 300 organizations from 50 countries, analyses the world´s largest banks´ exposure to the fossil fuel sector. Santander was one of the analysed banks, and the fgures contained here show our relative position versus our peers and other banks, measured in terms of our total fossil fuel exposure, and its weighting when compared to total lending.
Ranking way below most of our peers and other banks, Santander´s low fossil fuel fnance exposure, in both absolute and relative terms, is further evidence of our commitment not to fnance sectors that have a negative impact on climate change.
Our fossil fuels exposure over our total lending barely reaches 1% and is the lowest ratio among our nine peers. Our volume of fossil fuel fnance is more than 5 times smaller when compared to the leading bank.

Reducing our environmental footprint. 
We are strongly committed to protecting the environment by reducing our footprint. We base our environmental management strategy on three areas: reducing and ofsetting CO2 emissions, reducing and managing waste responsibly, raising employees’ and other stakeholders’ awareness of environmental issues.
We’ve been measuring our environmental footprint (energy consumption, waste and emissions) since 2001. Since 2011, our strict energy efciency and sustainability initiatives have made sure we have the lowest possible impact on the environment.

In 2019, we set three targets to reduce our direct impact on the environment: • To source 60% of our electricity from renewable energy by 2021 and 100% by 2025 (currently at 50%).
• To become carbon neutral by ofsetting all the emissions generated by our own operations from 2020 onwards.
• To eliminate unnecessary single-use plastic in our branches and corporate buildings in G101 by 2021.
Emissions in 2020 by sources. 
Use of energy from renewable sources To further reduce carbon emissions, we committed to source all our electricity from renewable sources (where possible) by 2025.
At the end of June 2021, 74% of the electricity used in our buildings was renewable, with 100% green energy in Germany, Spain, Portugal and the UK. We continue to work towards our 100% target by 2025.
The emissions reduction for electricity consumption was 21%, thanks to the purchase of green energy. In terms of the total, this enabled us to reduce our emissions by 12%.

Waste zero certifcation. 
At our Group headquarters (Santander Group City, or SGC) in Boadilla del Monte, Madrid, home to more than 8,000 employees, we have a 1,000 sqm recycling facility where 30 diferent types of waste are sorted and collected.
We’re the frst fnancial institution in Spain to be “Zero Waste” certifed by AENOR. This certifcation recognizes that at least 90% of the waste generated at SGC is reintroduced into the value chain. So far this year, we’ve sorted 1.9 million kilos of waste at our recycling facility.
This certifcation is a testament to our commitment to sustainability, respect for the environment and cooperation with the circular economy as a responsible bank that rests on three pillars: reduce, reuse and recycle.
We’ve also obtained the Zero Waste certifcation by Aenor in other three main buildings in Madrid (Luca de Tena, Abelias and Josefa Valcarcel), where more than 6,700 employees work.

Finance is a critical enabler of the transition towards a low-carbon economy. At Santander, we want to play our part and support our 148 million customers and the economies where we operate, through this journey towards a greener and more sustainable world Net Zero by 2050.
Our goal is to ofer our products and services that support our customers’ transition towards a greener economy and align our portfolio with our climate ambition, while we deliver on our public commitments and regulatory requirements. Our green fnance approach is through a customer centric mind-set, harnessing commercial opportunities through specifc green activities around four key verticals: (i) clean mobility, (ii) green buildings, (iii) agriculture, and (iv) renewables.
Santander is already playing a major role in helping to tackle climate change and enable the transition to the green economy and has already committed to: • Raise or facilitate the mobilization of 120 billion euros in green fnance by 2025 and 220 billion euros by 2030. Until June 2021, Santander CIB division has contributed with 41.7 billion euros to this commitment. Separately, Santander Retail and Commercial division are also raising green fnancing.
• Maintain our leadership position in renewables, as well as leveraging our origination capabilities to issue more green bonds.
o The volume of greenfeld renewable energy projects fnanced represents enough installed capacity to power 10.3 million homes and avoid 60 million tons of CO2 emissions.
• Develop our green products proposition including: green mortgages; energy efciency loans; loans to install solar panels, for electric vehicles, and for low carbon agriculture; ESG investment solutions incentivizing our clients to improve their ESG performance through Sustainability linked Loans (SLLs); and additional services such as eco-cards and carbon footprint measurement tools, which allow customers to ofset emissions.
• Progress with ESG bonds issuance and net zero commitment in Santander Asset Management, joining the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative.
o Santander has already issued three 1 billion-euro green bonds as part of a global sustainable debt plan. The funds are being used to fnance and refnance existing and future wind and solar power projects. In the green bond issued in October 2019 for institutional investors, proceeds fnanced 32 solar and photovoltaic projects with an installed capacity of more than 6,300 MW1, avoiding the emission of 909,417 million tons of CO2.
o We are expanding our range of ESG products in Wealth Management, with over €8bn of assets under management (Jun21), including €7.5bn from Santander Asset Management and an additional €550mm from third party funds in Private Banking.
• We continue to fght deforestation and its negative impact on climate change and biodiversity, especially in the Amazon.

Sustainable Finance Classifcation System. 
The Sustainable Finance Classifcation System (“SFCS”) is an internal guideline with the criteria for identifying sustainable fnance activities. It will provide Santander with a uniform and harmonized approach to sustainable fnance designed to allow consistent activity tracking, support the development of themed solutions for our clients and mitigate potential greenwashing risk.
The SFCS will be a key enabler to develop our sustainable fnance proposition, complementing the existing Global Sustainable Bond Framework and our Green Finance Commitment and ensuring it is aligned with our climate ambition.
It draws upon internationally accepted guidelines and principles such as ICMA Social and Green Bond Principles, the Climate Bond Standards and it is aligned with the EU Taxonomy.
The SFCS will apply to all Santander business units and subsidiaries, and will capture two complementary approaches to sustainable fnance: → The funds of the transaction are directed towards activities with a green or social impact (i.e. a regular client that wants to install solar panels) 41.7 bn 120 bn → The funds of the transaction may not be solely dedicated to green or social activities but are designated to incentivize clients to achieve ESG targets or better ESG performance through sustainability-linked transactions. 
It outlines the classifcation logic, eligibility parameters for social and green activities, the applicable environmental and social due diligence requirements, and the verifcation methodology for sustainable fnance transactions.
Diferent pilots have been conducted to test its applicability in Spain, UK, and Digital Consumer Bank with the following preliminary results: → Green buildings: 1.6 billion euros in real estate development loans with Energy Performance Certifcate (EPC) B or above → Clean mobility: 3.6 billion in electric or hybrid vehicles from new auto deals → Renewables: 1.3 billion euros in solar panels leased in Spain. 
Corporate and Investment Banking. 
SCIB Contribution to Climate Finance. 
Santander Corporate and Investment Banking (SCIB) aims to be a leading bank for providing sustainable fnance and ESG solutions across our geographies and product spectrum.
Leveraging on a strong track record in renewable energy fnancing and advisory, SCIB is aiming to integrate ESG and sustainability considerations across all sectors and products, serving an increasing demand from corporates and investors while contributing to Santander´s own ambition.
The ambition is to become the leading fnancial platform for energy transition-enabling technologies by supporting our clients in achieving their sustainability objectives and transition towards more responsible, social and environmentally sustainable business models.
SCIB set up a dedicated, global ESG Solutions team in 2020 to bolster its sustainable fnance proposition. The team works closely with the product teams across SCIB’s platform to provide strategic solutions as well as product and fnancing structures tailored to specifc sectors, geographies and market sectors.

As a retail bank, we support our customers’ transition to a low-carbon economy by ofering products and services that meet their needs and demands. In order to do so, we have identifed 5 key focus areas: Green buildings, renewables, clean mobility, agro and circular economy.
And we do so through: • Specifc retail products (Santander Green Book) like green mortgages, energy efciency loans, leasing to install renewable energy, loans to electric vehicles or low carbon agriculture. Since 2019, Santander has granted 1.5 billion euros in green fnancing through this Green Book • General purpose lending directed to economic activities that contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation, promote sustainable use of resources.
Testing the Sustainable Finance Classifcation System (SFCS) in three specifc segments, namely green buildings in Spain, clean mobility and renewables in SCF, we have been to spot 6.3 billion euros that were not being captured before through the Green Book. The further implementation of the SFCS classifcation will further provide clarity to support business origination and meet the increasing demand for ESG solutions, driving innovation and new product development. Thus, it will ensure consistency across the Group and help us deliver and potentially enhance our support to clients in their transition.

In some of these countries Chooose ofers CO2 ofsetting through dedicated websites where the customer can calculate and ofset the emissions related to their driving, while in Portugal the Bank plants a tree on behalf of the customer for each contract including insurance. In Sweden, the Bank compensates a fxed amount for the customers fnancing feets. The contributions go to closelyselected carbon reducing projects in developing countries that replace oil and coal with renewable energy. By ofering carbon ofsetting solutions, SCF wants to give customers the possibility to create a positive impact on the environment and enables them to address the carbon footprint from their driving emissions.
Uruguay. 
First auto loan in Uruguay with a carbon zero footprint for the 0km cars. Buyers will receive carbon credits that certify that the CO2 emitted will be compensated.
SCF UK. 
Santander Consumer UK and iOfset have launched their “Go Green” initiative, a service that enables customers to calculate and ofset their vehicle emissions.
SCF France. 
SCF France aims to promote a green attitude among its customers with the “reforest’ACTION” initiative to boost the use of e-signatures, planting a tree for each contract signed electronically.
Chile. 
Carbon footprint ofsetting. 
In Chile, we have developed a methodology that estimates the Carbon Footprint for every single client based on his or her local Credit and Debit Card transactions. We then share the calculated cost of ofsetting their Carbon Footprint and ofer them the options of: → Buying Carbon Credits: CarboNutral buys Carbon Credits with international certifcation.
→ Donating to the Conservation of Chilean Ecosystems by fnancing specifc conservation projects that are implemented by NGO’s in protected areas throughout Chile.
UK Spain. 
Santander UK launched a carbon footprint tracker pilot for retail customers in partnership with leading sustainability fntech CoGo. This project provides customers with an insight into how their spending has an impact on the environment.
Santander Spain is also developing a carbon footprint tracker.
Finland. 
Green All in One. 
Green All in One is the frst product in the Finnish car market to ofer inexpensively carbon emission ofsetting. The product can be included in the fnancing agreement for a petrol, diesel or hybrid car to be registered for the frst time. This ofset is included in the monthly quota.
Brazil. 
Carbon Markets CBIO’s. 
Santander is an active player in the frst regulated carbon market in Brazil created by the Renovabio legislation. Santander engaged with the Government during the design of this regulation. Santander was the frst bank to work as a CBIO’s (carbon credit) underwriter and to trade them. Under the scheme, biofuel producers are able to issue and trade carbon credits (CBIO’s) with fuel retailers required by law to buy a certain amount of CBIO’s or face penalties. By the end of 2020, we had 69% of CBIOs underwriter market share.

Financing the green transition. 
Working with multilateral institutions: fnancing energy efciency and renewable energy projects In the last four years, we’ve signed agreements with the EIB (European Investment Bank), EBRD (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, IFC (International Finance Corporation), MIGA (Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency ), CEB (Council of Europe Development Bank), the CAF Development Bank of Latin America and others to provide over 1.36 billion in green fnance in Spain, Poland, Portugal, Brazil and Peru. Other agreements reached in this area total 11.1 billion euros.
In 2020, we continued to work with multilateral entities to ofer our customers more lines of credit under better conditions, meeting the needs of everyone in society and supporting their green transition. We signed three fnancing agreements with MDBs (Multilateral Development Banks) to contribute 104 million euros to green fnancing projects.
Amid the economic and social crisis caused by covid-19, we provided customers with solutions to weather the storm and continue pursuing their goals.
In Spain, we have signed seven agreements worth a total of 1.2 billion euros with the EIB Group (including the European Investment Fund – “EIF”) to provide additional liquidity and investment capacity for SMEs and midcaps to tackle the pandemic, renew their transport feet or become more sustainable.
Moreover, thanks to the EIF’s involvement in a synthetic securitization initiative, we aim to provide 10 million euros in new climate-related investments.
In Portugal, a guarantee agreement with the EIF enables us to furnish agricultural and agro-sector companies and entrepreneurs with up to EUR 100 million in working capital and investment capacity, as well as help young farmers invest in their business. The EIB Group also participated in Banco Santander Consumer Portugal’s securitization initiative that mobilized 587 million euros for SMEs and mid-caps to renew their transport feets.
In Brazil, a 100 million-dollar loan facility from the IFC supports projects that promote the use of renewable energy and energy efciency, as well as Santander’s working capital lending programme for Brazilian SMEs.
In Poland, a synthetic securitization agreement signed with the EIB Group enables us to provide around 2.8 billion zloty in new funding to SMEs and mid-caps.
Santander Wealth Management & Insurance. 
In recent years, Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) has become paramount in investment. More investors have been considering environmental and social issues to assess risk-adjusted returns in the mediumto-long term, while clients, employees and other stakeholders interest in ESG has also been growing signifcantly. We are focused on our ESG strategy across the division by: embedding ESG factors in our decision-making process, building a sustainable value proposition for clients, playing an active role on engagement and adopting the highest international ESG standards, with special focus on climate. 
We’ve been embedding ESG factors in our decision- making. In 2020, we shored up our ESG strategy.
Santander Asset Management. 
ESG Governance in Santander Asset Management Santander Asset Management has a framework of policies and a governance structure for the correct implementation of its Sustainable and Responsible Investment strategy, which involves the application of environmental (including climate change), social and governance (ESG) criteria in investment decisions. Governance comes from such bodies as the SRI governance committee, the investment and sustainability committees and the global, expert SRI team. The SRI (Socially Responsible Investment) governance committee is the highest body and is chaired by the head of Wealth Management & Insurance. It is responsible for approving and overseeing the global SRI strategy.
Santander Asset Management has a Sustainable and Responsible Investment Policy that outlines our SRI approach and the criteria used to integrate ESG variables in investment. The Engagement Policy explains the principles SAM follows in relation to ESG engagement with investees or companies we wish to invest in individually or through collaborative engagement initiatives. In 2020, SAM approved a voting policy that sets the guidelines for voting at the annual general meetings of the companies SAM invests in.

Climate change as part of our ESG methodology Climate change is embedded in our proprietary ESG analysis model through relevant indicators and a weighting system that enables us to account for these factors within our ESG performance evaluation. We assess issuers’ performance on climate change (according to its materiality in each sector) within the environmental pillar analysis that generates ESG scores. Our climate change analysis includes such criteria as CO2 emissions, emissions targets, alignment with TCFD recommendations, and risks and opportunities. We use the ESG score in the investment selection and portfolio management of our SRI products, according to the SRI strategies applied to each of them.

Financing the green transition. 
Santander Asset Management: an active player in Sustainable Finance. 
Santander Asset Management’s commitment to SRI has several lines of action: → Close monitoring of regulatory developments under the EU Sustainable Finance Plan, with special focus on the EU Taxonomy, which will be a common language to assess whether investments are meeting robust environmental standards and are consistent with high-level policy commitments such as the Paris Agreement.
The appropriate use of the taxonomy entails facing challenges like the availability of information aligned with this new classifcation. The lack of data is one of the major obstacles to implementing the taxonomy properly. That’s why we’re working on data availability solutions that meet asset managers’ requirements.
→ UN PRI: We adopted the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) in July 2020 to demonstrate our commitment to responsible investment, placing us at the heart of a global community seeking to build a more sustainable fnancial system. The Santander employees’ pension fund in Spain is also a signatory.
→ Training. We collaborate with universities and educational centres to organize and participate in SRI events and training days (virtual EFPA classrooms, UNED/ Spainsif MOOC, etc.) We also run internal sessions where we highlight the relevance of the Sustainable Development Goals and climate change as key drivers for promoting SRI.
→ International Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC). In 2020, Santander Asset Management became a signatory to the IIGCC, the European membership body for investor collaboration on climate change and the voice of investors taking action for a prosperous, low-carbon future.
→ Climate Action 100+. In January 2021, Santander Asset Management signed up to Climate Action 100+ to promote action on climate change among the world’s largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters. This initiative entails engagement with one of the companies included in its scope to ensure they take necessary action on climate change. Five regional investor networks coordinate the movement, including two to which SAM is a signatory: llGCC and PRl.
Private banking. 
We are embedding ESG in our private banking advisory services, to respond to the investment needs of our customers. In 2021, we have been awarded by Euromoney as the best private bank in ESG and Impact investing in Latam, Chile, Mexico, Portugal, Spain and Poland.
ESG experts Training is a cornerstone of our ESG strategy. In 2020, our bankers and advisers (over 1,100 experts), received special training from our ESG team at SAM and Private Banking. In 2021, we’ve been reinforcing ESG communications and learning materials; designating specialists in each country; and setting up a governance model for better ESG products and advisory services.
Our sustainable private banking value proposition Our ESG proposition comprises of a wide range of traditional mutual funds, alternative products and ETFs. We are working on rounding of our value proposition with new products across all asset classes and an impact investment options. We have nearly EUR 1.8bn in AUMs in ESG products.
Future Wealth, a thematic investment initiative that we launched in 4Q20, brings the environment to the fore, complementing clients’ traditional strategies with innovative and sustainable sources of growth and returns.
SAM’s ESG ratings methodology allows us to analyse all the third-party funds we market. We’ve been running thorough due diligence on the factors and investment strategies of products subject to SFDR, despite being reported under article 8 or 9.
ESG portfolio review Talking to our clients about their ESG preferences is essential so we can provide them with tailored-made reports that include a strong portfolio review in terms of i) impact (CO2 emissions, water consumption footprint, waste increase and energy saving), ii) SDG alignment, and iii) performance according to our internal ESG methodology.
Insurance. 
We have focused our eforts on two main actions. First, to maximize the portion of our life-savings premiums invested under the ESG standards set by SAM. Secondly, we are also working with our JV partners: to adhere to the UN’s Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI) and to develop specifc strategies in fnancial education and inclusion related issues in the geographies in which we operate.

Collaboration with stakeholders. 
Collaboration with stakeholders. 
Sector working groups. 
The nature and size of the climate change challenge require collaboration between stakeholders with diverse expertise. In line with SDG 17 (Partnerships for the goals), Santander enters into partnerships to help achieve global and company goals covering various international and local issues and stakeholders (sector associations, think tanks, universities, peers and others). Our key initiatives with leading organizations to improve how banks manage climate change include:
United Nations Environmental Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI)
Santander was a founder member of the UN Principles for Responsible Banking and has worked tirelessly to implement them. We also joined the UN Collective Commitment to Climate Action in September 2019 and formed part of working groups. Most recently, we worked with UNEP FI, peers and other partners to create the Net Zero Banking Alliance. We will continue to help build on this initiative by driving through our commitments and collaborating with the UNEP FI and peers to develop tools and methods that enable banks to set and achieve net zero targets. We will now also be engaging within the newly formed Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), set to be the umbrella organization for and represent the fnancial sector towards the 2021 COP in Glasgow and beyond. Our Executive Chairman is a member of the Principals Group which, among other things, will set the strategic direction for GFANZ and promote net zero alliances.
Santander has continued to work alongside the UNEP FI on the TCFD Banking Pilot Projects to develop and refne metrics, tools and methods to enable banks to implement the TCFD recommendations since their inception in 2017.
Banking Environment Initiative (BEI)
Following on from BEI’s successful Bank 2030 initiative to set out a vision for banks to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy, Santander collaborated with The Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership and peers to develop a guide for relationship managers to engage customers on their decarbonization plans and associated fnancing needs. The Let’s Discuss Climate guide’s fve-phase approach provides context, helpful resources and pointing questions to help relationship bankers have more strategic conversations with their clients about the risks and opportunities posed by climate change and assist them in accelerating the transition to a net zero economy.
United Nations Global Investors for Sustainable Development Alliance (GISD)
We are an active member of the GISD Alliance, a working group created as part of the UN’s strategy for fnancing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. SCIB collaborates with one of the task forces that aims to develop investment platforms and vehicles to catalyse fnance and investment fows to developing countries in support of the SDGs. The focus of this working group is to accelerate the fow of capital into emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), where needs and SDG impact are the greatest.
World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)
Agriculture is one of the most challenging sectors to align with targets. Santander has joined forces with the WBCSD and other partners to bring together key stakeholders to work on developing data, methods, tools and guidance for banks to assess, manage and act on aligning agricultural portfolios with climate scenarios. This is a cross-sector initiative as part of the WBCSD’s Scaling Positive Agriculture project under the Food and Nature programme, and aims to build a framework to transform organizations’ operations and align with the target to keep global warming to within 1.5°C of pre-industrial levels.
We have supported WBCSD and participated in the development of the ground-breaking Vision 2050: Time to transform publication which sets a shared vision of a world in which more than 9 billion people are able to live well, within planetary boundaries, by 2050.
Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets (TSVCM)
Santander is also part of the Consultative Group of the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets (TSVCM), contributing to discussions to scale an efective and efcient voluntary carbon market, which will be an important element in delivering net zero commitments.
World Economic Forum Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders. 
Santander recently joined the World Economic Forum Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders as an important network to infuence stakeholders, including policymakers, and drive change towards meeting net zero targets.

Collaboration with stakeholders. 
Engagement with regulators, sector bodies and other stakeholders. 
Santander plays an active role in the climate change and sustainable fnance policy debate by participating in formal consultations on key regulations locally, in Europe and globally. We also take part in sector forums and workshops on the transition to a low-carbon economy.
In the same line, we also actively engage with the Financial Stability Board, European Banking Authority, European Banking Federation and Bank of Spain among others that are contributing to build fnance solutions that better support the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on climate.
We work very closely with sector bodies – including the Institute of International Finance, European Financial Services Round Table, the Association for Financial Markets in Europe and the European Banking Federation – to reach common positions on such issues as the implementation and continued development of the EU framework for identifying sustainable economic activities (the so-called Taxonomy), the framework for ESG disclosures the disclosures in the Pillar 3 report, the defnition of standards and labels for sustainable products, as well as the ongoing work on the identifcation and management of climate-related risks.
In addition, Santander is part of the European Banking Federation - UNEP FI partnership that is working on banks’ application of the EU Taxonomy to core banking products. The frst stage of this collaboration resulted in voluntary guidelines and recommendations issued in April 2021 to banks and policymakers. We are also participating in the second stage of the project on the analysis related to use of proceeds, KPIs, retail and SMEs and transition. Through our involvement, we aim to aid the sector’s understanding of the Taxonomy, helping build an efective framework that drives the sustainability agenda and ensures it is consistent with Santander’s responsible banking ambitions and priorities.
We participate as speakers in conferences, diferent organisms’ events, consultation papers; working with other stakeholders to contribute to progress on the climate change agenda.
Santander also maintains an open dialogue and engages with NGOs on studies and initiatives.
Our position on some key issues. 
We want to help achieve sustainable development and pledge to play an active role in supporting the green transition. It is vital that the transition is fair and inclusive, taking into account regional and sector specifcities to avoid isolating communities and stranded creating assets. It must provide clarity and certainty for each sector. Governments should set clear pathways on how key sectors will meet the targets of a low-carbon economy, backed by policies and incentives that enable banks to support companies in their transition.
We aim to contribute constructively to the transition debate by supporting policymakers and regulators to achieve a global, common approach to regulation – especially as regards the green taxonomy, disclosure and reporting standards.
The EU Taxonomy is a step forward in the sustainability agenda. We need to build on this approach in other regions that seek to create taxonomies to align the understanding of what is sustainable and avoid regulatory fragmentation.
Disclosure: transparency to the market is necessary to understand how companies are embedding sustainability into their strategy and business models. As the fnancial sector complies with a growing number of new climate-related disclosures (particularly the upcoming Taxonomyrelated disclosures and ESG disclosures in the Pillar 3 report), these requirements must take into consideration the information readily available. Non-fnancial corporate disclosures must be well-defned and reinforced. The publication of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive to review the Non- Financial Reporting Directive could be instrumental in achieving this. Banks and authorities need this information to spot and assess risks and opportunities from climate activities and ensure compliance, as well as understanding the composition of their portfolios.
We would back further eforts to ensure a global approach to companies’ ESG-related disclosures. We support the IFRS’s ongoing work to develop a global sustainability standard – highly sought after to measure companies’ sustainability performance in a comparable way.
Carbon pricing and subsidies: Policies and regulations are key to fxing prices and guiding the transition through transparent incentives. Governments must set clear pathways for each sector to transition to a low-carbon economy.
Fossil fuel subsidies must be reviewed to support progress on phasing them out. The policy framework should ensure that fuel prices include the associated environmental costs.
An efective carbon pricing mechanism can contribute to reducing emissions and driving investment in low-carbon technologies and infrastructure. Carbon policy instruments should form part of a broader policy framework that includes energy efciency research and emissions. In line with the initiatives that organizations like the WBCSD are supporting, international alignment should be prioritised so that solutions work across regions.

Collaboration with stakeholders b. Initiatives by country. 
We feel it’s important not only to protect our ecosystems but also to restore them while striking a balance between economic growth and social wellbeing. That’s why we’re promoting and cooperating on several projects that aim to save our planet.
Spain. 
Our Plan Natura initiative on environmental conservation consists of activities to reforest wooded areas, clean up beaches and riverbanks, install bird houses, etc., with the help of hundreds of Santander employees who volunteer. This allows us to follow through on our commitment to looking after ecosystems with the help of our professionals.
Our work to help protect the environment starts at our Corporate Centre. Ecosystem conservation and CO2 reduction at the Santander Group City in Boadilla del Monte, Madrid, are shining examples of our commitment.
We’ve managed to create the perfect reserve for over 60 species, improving the Centre’s natural setting. How have we done it? Our Corporate Centre covers 215 hectares, including 170 for green areas. Its design is both functional and environmentally friendly, with minimal impact on nature. It is home to vast gardens with over 20,000 trees of more than 40 species, including olive trees (the city’s symbol), cork, red oak, poplar, ash and fruit trees.
Furthermore, through Fundación Banco Santander, we’ve launched initiatives to preserve endangered Spanish species and ecosystems. The Fundación carries out actions across Spain to rehabilitate, conserve and restore fora and fauna in partnership with other entities and NGOs. Some examples of its ongoing projects are: 1. Santander for the Seas In 2021, this programme focused on supporting projects and initiatives on conservation, habitat recovery and marine life, with three objectives:
A. Mitigate damage to seas and oceans.
B. Publicize the importance of the Blue Economy and climate change.
C. Raise awareness of society’s role in protecting the environment.
The programme will support a maximum of three projects and allocate funds of up to EUR 150,000 to each one.

Poland. 
PNUMAGrid’s Generacja (‘Regeneration’) project In Poland, for World Environment Day, we’ll be taking part in PNUMAGrid’s Generacja (‘Regeneration’) ecosystem preservation project.
As a strategic partner in this initiative, we aim to play an active role in the conservation of ecosystems. For six months, we’ll become conservationists for one of the country’s most protected ecosystems, acting as stewards of 16.35 hectares of meadows and pastures around the Mała Czantoria and Wielka Czantoria mountains in the Lower Silesia region.
Other initiatives. 
Brazil We signed a momentous agreement in 2020 with Bradesco and Itaú Unibanco for the conservation of the Amazon Rainforest.
Mexico We’re working with the sustainable forests initiative, Reforestamos (“We reforest”), which has raised over 1,200,000 pesos in donations made at our ATMs.
Chile We’re part of the Parque el Durazno project, which has just completed its frst phase; it aims to restore run-down areas and protect the ecosystem of the Canela commune (in the Coquimbo Region) against erosion, while creating corridors for native wildlife.

A. The report covers Grupo Santander’s core markets: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Mexico, Poland, Portugal, Spain, United Kingdom and United States (excluding Puerto Rico and Miami). Consumption, waste generation and emissions reporting decreased due to the covid-19 pandemic.
B. Figures on water use from the public water supply.
C. External energy consumption resulting from employee travel and business trips was: 579,155 GJ in 2020 and 1,721,139 GJ in 2019.
D. 2019 and 2020 fgures do not include waste from the commercial network in Brazil. Also, 2019 fgures do not include waste for Argentina.
E. Emissions include those derived from the direct consumption of energy (natural gas and diesel, and additionally, in the particular case of Mexico, gasoline and diesel for automobiles and LPG) correspond to scope 1, defned by the GHG Protocol standard. To calculate these emissions, the emission factors DEFRA 2020 for 2020 and DEFRA 2019 for 2019 were applied. 
F. Emissions from electricity consumption correspond to the scope 2 defned by the GHG Protocol standard. In both 2020 and 2019 the IEA (International Energy Agency) emission factors for 2017 have been used.
- Indirect Electricity Emissions - Market-based: zero emissions from green electricity consumed in Germany, Spain, Portugal and UK; electricity in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Poland and the US partially sourced from green energy; CO2 reduction amounted to 153,582 tonnes in 2020 and 138,660 tonnes in 2019; remaining electricity consumption measured according to the IEA’s emission factor for each country - Indirect emissions of electricity - Location-based: Total electricity consumption measured according to the IEA’s emission factor for each country, regardless of source (renewable or non-renewable)
G. Indirect electricity emissions fell mainly because of higher green energy purchase in 2020 in G10 countries. 
H. Emissions from employee travel from central services in each country to workplace by car, collective vehicles and rail, and from business travel by air and car. Type of travel by employee determined from surveys or other estimates. DEFRA 2020 for 2020 and DEFRA 2019 for 2019 were conversion factors to calculate emissions from employee travel - Employees travelling to work in own vehicles estimated according to parking spaces in central services buildings and to diesel/petrol consumption mix of vehicle feet in each country. Data from Argentina, Poland and the UK unavailable and not reported - Employees’ journeys in collective vehicles and rail calculated from average distance travelled by Grupo Santander collective transport rentals for employees in Germany, Brazil, the US, Spain, Mexico, Poland, Santander Consumer Finance and Portugal, and the central services in Spain (CGS) and at the Luca de Tena building - Data on business trips by car from USA Consumer are not reported, as the information is not available.
- Emissions from courier services, the transport of funds, any purchase of products or services, and indirect emissions owing to provided fnancial services not included.
I. Indirect emissions from employee travel have plummeted due to reduced mobility during the covid-19 pandemic and remote working.
J. Data restated from 2020 annual report english version.
