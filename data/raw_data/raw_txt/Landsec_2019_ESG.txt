Help a total of 1,200 people furthest from the jobs market to secure employment by 2020.
By 2020, ensure everyone working on our behalf, in an environment we control, is given equal opportunities, protected from discrimination and paid at least the Foundation Living Wage.
Make measurable improvements to the profile — in terms of gender, ethnicity and disability — of our employee mix.
Maintain an exceptional standard of health, safety and security in all the working environments we control.
Performance: Complete Performance: On track Performance: On track Performance: On track. 
Since 2011 we’ve secured employment for 1,336 people furthest from the job market through our programme. In the year we secured 187 jobs, 105 in London and 82 in Retail. To deliver on this commitment, we launched the UK’s first-ever aerial window cleaning training academy at Her Majesty’s Prison & Young Offender Institution Isis, and Ambition:Leeds, a new training academy for retail and hospitality talent, responding to demand from retailers for more skilled recruits ready to join their workforce. Toward the end of the year, we set an ambitious new commitment to create £25m of social value by 2025 through our community employment activities.
We continue to be an accredited Living Wage employer, both for our employees and those working on our behalf. This year we joined the Living Wage Employers’ Group, a cross-industry partnership tasked with driving adoption of Foundation Living Wage rates in the supply chain. In the year we carried out due-diligence in our service and construction partners’ organisations to gauge adherence to our Living Wage commitment. Results indicate there are some areas where rates are not being met, we will focus our engagement on these areas in the year ahead. Employers who have yet to transition to the Living Wage by 2020 agreed to communicate this commitment to their staff.
We continue to meet Hampton Alexander targets with 40% of the Board and 42% of Executive Committee and direct reports being female versus targets of 33%. We have improved disclosure of diversity data in the organisation which has allowed us to set meaningful targets for 2025 around a broader set of diversity characteristics. However, we have moved backwards in terms of female representation at Leader level in the organisation (2018: 24.4%; 2019: 19.5%).
We continually prepare the business to anticipate and respond to incidents and this year have enhanced our security training and advice for employees and partners. We continue to lead and participate in a number of cross-industry forums in the fields of health, safety and security.
This year we’ve again we maintained our OHSAS 18001 certification across 100% of our sites. Following the Grenfell fire, we worked closely with customers, partners and other key stakeholders to consider the potential ramifications of cladding across our portfolio.

Reduce carbon intensity (kgCO2e/m2) by 40% by 2030 compared with a 2013/14 baseline, for property under our management for at least two years.
— Ensure 100% of our electricity supplies through our corporate contract are from REGO-backed renewable sources — Achieve 3MW of renewable electricity capacity by 2030.
Reduce energy intensity (kWh/m2) by 40% by 2030 compared with a 2013/14 baseline, for property under our management for at least two years.
— Send zero waste to landfill — At least 75% recycled across all our operational activities by 2020.
Performance: On track Performance: Complete Performance: On track Performance: Complete. 
We’ve reduced carbon intensity by 39.8% compared to 2013/14 baseline, significantly outperforming our target pathway. This is an improvement compared to the 2017/18 reduction of 28.6%. These reductions have been achieved through a combination of energy efficiency projects, changes in our portfolio, and changes in emissions factors. In the year we have successfully transitioned projects in our development pipeline away from fossil fuels toward full or partial electrification, designing in Air Source Heat Pump and electric vehicle solutions. We continue to focus on reducing carbon emissions in the construction supply chain through engaging our design and delivery partners.
We continue to procure 100% renewable electricity across our portfolio through our corporate contract. At least 15% of gas volumes are from green sources.
Performance: On track. 
Our current on-site renewable electricity capacity is 1.5 MW. In March we successfully installed a 30 kWp solar PV system on the roof of Westgate, Oxford which will produce approximately 30,000 kWh of electricity per year. We’ve also completed solar PV feasibility studies for our outlet destinations at Junction 32, Braintree Village and Clarks Village, and commenced a feasibility study for a large-scale solar farm in our strategic land development pipeline.
We‘ve reduced energy intensity by 18.2% compared to 2013/14 baseline year. This is an improvement compared to the 2017/18 reduction of 14.3%. To deliver on this commitment in Retail we carried out several lighting and equipment upgrades including replacing car park lighting with LED at Bluewater, delivering a saving of over 830 kWh. In London we partnered with our customer at 7 Soho Square to install LED lighting, reducing the building’s electricity usage by 13%. In the year we committed to £3m of energy reduction projects which, combined with a drive to improve the efficiency of our existing systems, will deliver further energy reductions in the year ahead.
We continue to divert 100% from landfill across our operational activities.
Performance: On track. 
In the year we recycled 74.7% of operational waste, achieving 78.9% in London, 76.8% at our Shopping Centres and 60.0% in our Leisure and Retail Parks which are managed by Savills. We launched coffee cup and fashion textile recycling schemes across our portfolio, working with consumer, customers and our supply chain partners to find better solutions to resource use. Our Refill Me campaign to tackle single-use plastics brought together over 100 retailers to offer shoppers free refills of water.

Performance: On track Performance: On track Performance: On track Performance: On track. 
Following the release of the UK Climate Projections 2018 which forecasts the expected effects of climate change, we conducted further research to determine how climate change will affect our portfolio. This has provided an up to date view of climate risk at the portfolio level, helping to inform our activities across the property lifecycle. In the year our investment and divestment activities have reduced the risk to our portfolio from extreme weather. We are one of 600 organisations publicly committed to the Task Force for ClimateRelated Financial Disclosures and offer a greater level of transparency to investors this year through our disclosures.
In the year we have progressed the design of our developments against this target. Our 21 Moorfields development team are targeting procurement of all core construction materials which are manufactured within the UK and Europe only, to reduce emissions from transportation and reduce risk of ethical issues in manufacture and extraction. Building on these processes, we have included responsible sourcing guidelines in our design guides, providing our design and delivery partners with strict environmental and ethical parameters. In the year ahead as our development pipeline progresses to construction, we will report our quantitative progress against this target.
In the year we extended our biodiversity commitment to our assets in London and are assessing opportunities for installations in the year ahead. We’ve planned and secured budget for biodiversity enhancements to the five sites offering the greatest potential, which will deliver net gain in biodiversity at each site of between 5% and 25%. Completed projects include a 220m2 wildflower garden installed at Hatfield Galleria and planting of aquatic plant species in the lakes at White Rose, Leeds. We’re also committed to delivering net gain through our development pipeline, and our 21 Moorfields development will deliver over 1,700 m2 of new green walls, trees and plants, totalling 76 different species. We are developing a strategy for all future developments to deliver net gain.
Using learnings from our 80-100 Victoria Street project we’re have adopted wellbeing clauses in our engineering specifications and design briefs. This will ensure our developments deliver specific wellbeing outcomes and that customers are not prevented from achieving the WELL™ standard during their fit out. Our commercial office developments focus on the delivery of optimal air and water quality, daylighting, acoustic and thermal comfort. In addition to core technical design factors, we are focusing on delivering wellbeing features, with our 21 Moorfields development featuring a central atrium and glazed stairwells to maximise penetration of daylight, a Zen garden and staff wellness centre.

06 Sustainability Performance and Data 2019. 
Sustainability Reporting Methodology. 
All energy, carbon and waste data reported for the financial year is for the 12 months to the end of February, as March data is not available in advance of our reporting duties.
Corporate commitment performance. 
This section provides an overview of the methodologies used to calculate the performance for the following commitments: — Reduce carbon intensity (kgCO2e/m2) by 40% by 2030 compared to a 2013/14 baseline, for property under our management for at least two years, with a longer-term ambition of an 80% reduction by 2050. This commitment was approved by the Science-based Target Initiative in 2016.
— Reduce energy intensity (kWh/m2) by 40% by 2030 compared to a 2013/14 baseline, for property under our management for at least two years.
— Send zero waste to landfill with at least 75% recycled across all our operational and construction activities by 2020.
We plan to extend this report to include methodologies for all sustainability corporate commitments in the future.
Energy and Carbon We report on sites where we have ‘operational control’, where we directly purchase energy or appoint agents who control the purchase of energy. Our commitment boundaries include only properties within our portfolio which have been under our management, or ‘operational control’, for at least two years. Once properties complete at least two years under our ‘operational control’, they will be included at the start of the following reporting year. We report on all energy procured by Landsec or appointed agents, including that consumed by our customers, and the emissions associated with this energy. Only gas or electricity which is supplied directly to units/demises by utility suppliers is excluded.
Energy consumption is normalised to account for changing conditions and to better communicate energy performance. Landsec uses three normalisation techniques: kWh electricity equivalent: Natural gas consumption is adjusted so all energy consumption can be reported by one metric: kWh electricity equivalent. Following the Better Building Partnership’s REEB methodology, the factor applied to 1 kWh of natural gas is 0.4, which accounts for the natural gas higher coefficient of production.
Degree day correction: Degree day normalisation ensures that the demand for heating (gas) and cooling (electricity) is reported relative to our baseline year. If our baseline year happened to experience, for example, record-breaking temperatures, inevitably our performance in later years would appear unrealistically improved, as we’d demand less heating/cooling as compared with our baseline. The heating degree days (HDD) we use quantify the number of days and the length of time that temperatures have dropped below a base temperature of 15.5°C and our cooling degree days (CDD) quantify the number of days and the length of time that temperatures have exceeded 15.5°C.
We obtain our degree days from http://www.degreedaysforfree.co.uk and each asset is assigned to its local region. Local degree days have been sourced for our 2013/14 baseline year and current period degree days are used to calculate a correction factor (base year DD/current period DD = normalisation factor). This normalisation is calculated for both HDD and CDD.
The HDD normalisation factor is then applied to natural gas consumption used for space heating, this is applied to all asset types. The CDD normalisation factor is only applied to London office buildings as these are the primary assets where electricity is used for cooling. In these assets we have calculated that 22% of all office electricity consumption can be attributed to cooling. This has been calculated by detailed analysis of a selection of buildings with adequate landlord sub-metering. The CDD normalisation factor is therefore only applied to 22% of office total electricity usage.
Removal of cooking gas: It has been recognised that natural gas used for cooking, where cooking is the tenants’ primary business function, can be directly correlated to their trade. Due to this direct correlation, we remove any natural gas consumption which is used for commercial cooking to better reflect the consumption where we have capacity and capability to drive reductions.
All normalisation techniques have been applied to our 2013/14 baseline year as well as the current reporting period.
Our commitments are measured by intensity based on floor area (m2). Our methodology for calculating floor area directly matches the area reported to that served by the energy procured. A breakdown of the methods used to calculate floor areas for different types of asset can be found below: — Offices: Office floor areas are based on Gross Internal. 
Area (GIA) but deducting any floor area where Landsec provides no utilities/heating and cooling. Floor area for restaurants where Landsec is supplying natural gas for cooking only is excluded (as the gas is also excluded).
— Retail and leisure parks: Retail and leisure park floor areas are calculated using the number of car park spaces. We have calculated an average car parking space size of 11.8m2, this assumes 5% are disabled bays. The number of spaces is multiplied by 11.8 m2 to calculate the base floor area. A further 20% is added to account for other landlord areas. Tenant floor area is included where Landsec supplies 100% of the energy to the demise. (The exceptions to this rule are Xscape Yorkshire and Xscape Milton Keynes which are treated as shopping centres due to their form and make-up.) — Shopping centres: Shopping centre floor areas are calculated using the same methodology for retail and leisure parks leisure described above, however instead of using the additional 20% allocation for landlord areas, measured common parts area is used instead. Tenant floor area is included where Landsec supplies 100% of the energy feeding the demise.


07 Sustainability Performance and Data 2019. 
These methods of calculating floor area have been utilised for both our 2013/14 baseline year as well as the current reporting period. They are used for all data reporting, including greenhouse gas emission reporting and our European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA) reporting.
Energy is reported as kWh/m2 where kWh electricity equivalent is used. Carbon emissions are reported as kgCO2e/m2.
CO2 is calculated using the ‘location-based’ method as described by the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol utilising annually published UK government conversion factors.
Waste We report on sites where we have ‘operational control’, where we directly contract waste management services or appoint agents who control contracting of such services. Our commitment boundaries include only properties within our portfolio which are under our management, or ‘operational control’, for at least one year. Once properties complete at least one year under our ‘operational control’, they will be included at the start of the following reporting year. We include all waste services contracted by Landsec or appointed agents and the emissions associated with these, this includes services contracted on behalf of our customers.
Reported mixed recycling includes recyclable waste streams; glass, plastic, metals, paper, cardboard, nonhazardous WEEE and fluorescent lamps. Landsec produces small amounts of hazardous waste from its operations which is recorded at an individual site level and excluded from total waste reported due to its immateriality. We do however stringently manage our statutory obligations around hazardous waste from our combined Energy and Environment management system certified to ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 50001:2011 standards. Confidential paper waste is also reported for some locations where we hold the management contract. This includes our own head office.
We report on different properties for waste and recycling compared to energy and carbon. This occurs as some waste is collated in shared loading bays for multiple buildings and because we do not manage the waste facilities and services for every tenant. We cross reference and check the reported property list with that used for energy and carbon reporting.
Waste performance is not normalised. Waste and recycling are reported in tonnes and associated carbon emissions are reported as tCO2e, utilising annually published UK government conversion factors.
Landfill tax avoided is calculated by multiplying the relevant annual landfill tax rate by the total tonnes of waste diverted from landfill for the same year, through other processes including recycling, composting, aerobic digestion and incineration.
Waste reporting for construction activities follows BREEAM waste reporting criteria, presenting the total volume of waste arising from the development, the recycling rates achieved and the diversion of waste from landfill. Data is compiled in this format by the nominated supply chain partner and submitted to Landsec on an annual basis. All construction waste from the commencement of the development until award of practical completion is included. Demolition and excavation waste are excluded.
Greenhouse gas emission reporting. 
We report our full greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually in accordance to the WRI GHG Protocol. Emissions are reported as tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e).
GHG emissions are broken down into three scopes, scope 1, 2 and 3.
Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from activities controlled by us that release emissions into the atmosphere, whereas scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions associated with our consumption of purchased energy.
At Landsec, scope 1 comprises emissions from natural gas, refrigerant gases and company owned vehicles. Scope 2 emissions are from electricity, heating and cooling purchased for common areas and shared services. All material sources of scope 1 and 2 emissions are reported.
As the remaining sources (e.g. diesel used in generator testing) represent such a small proportion of total emissions we do not report them.
Both scope 1 and scope 2 emissions are reported using both the ‘location-based’ and ‘market-based’ accounting methods. Location-based emissions are reported using UK Government greenhouse gas reporting – conversion factors 2018. Since April 2017, at least 15% of our gas purchases are from green sources (i.e. biogas). Our market-based emissions from biogas are reported as following: the CH4 or N2O emissions from biogas are reported as scope 1, and the CO2 portion of the biogas is reported outside of the scopes, as a memo line. Therefore, our scope 1 market-based emissions are based on the emissions from the remaining 85% of our gas purchases, as well as the CH4 or N2O conversion factors associated with biogas. Scope 2 market-based emissions are reported using the conversion factor associated with each individual electricity, heating and cooling supply.
Scope 3 emissions are those that are a consequence of our actions, but which occur at sources we do not own or control and which are not classed as scope 2 emissions. The GHG Protocol identifies 15 categories of which 8 are directly relevant for Landsec. The table below describes how each scope 3 category is treated in our reporting.

Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions using location-based emission factors have dropped by 18% compared with previous year. This has been primarily driven by a reduction in UK’s emission factors due a cleaner energy mix. Additionally, with more accurate sub-metering of tenant energy consumption, we’ve been able to more accurately allocate scope 3 emissions associated with energy consumption to tenants and taken it out of our scope 1 and 2 emissions. The detailed breakdown of main factors driving the change in our scope 1 and scope 2 can be seen in chart page 10. In terms of market-based emissions we have seen a reduction of 9%. This has been due to increasing the number of sites supplied with 100% renewable electricity via our contract with Smartest Energy and at least 15% of our total gas purchase from green sources. Detailed full scope 3 reporting is included on page 14.

This table shows the absolute energy consumption with a breakdown by landlord and tenant consumption. In 2018-19, absolute energy intensity has reduced by 1.1% compared with previous year. This has been achieved by savings realised from our active energy management programme. This year, we identified and committed to implement £3m worth of energy reduction projects across our portfolio. For instance, we replaced all car park lampposts with LEDs at our Bluewater shopping centre, delivering a saving of 832.458 kWh in the first six months. More information on our energy programme can be found on page 41 of the Annual Report.

Scope 1 Scope 2 Scope 3. 
The GHG Protocol splits scope 3 emissions into 15 categories. We assessed each one individually and decided which ones were applicable to our business. For the categories that are applicable we have obvious hot spots which are highlighted below:
Scope 3 emissions by category Chart 13 ■ Downstream leased assets 46.0% ■ Capital goods 32.7% ■ Purchased goods and services (PG&S) 17.6% ■ Fuel- and energy-related activities 3.2% ■ Others 0.5%
The two largest contributing categories are Capital goods and Downstream leased assets, making up 68.2% of our total emissions.
Capital goods include the emissions associated with the manufacture and transport of materials used within our development activity and Downstream leased assets are those associated with our customers within our assets. In addition to working closely with our supply partners and customers to reduce these emissions, there are additional reasons for the year on year reductions in both categories. For Capital goods, due to the current point in the market cycle there are very few current developments which are undergoing construction. For Downstream leased assets, reductions are primarily associated with changes in UK’s emission factors.

European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA) Sustainability Performance Measures reporting. 
Landsec is committed to EPRA Best Practice Recommendations for Sustainability reporting. This common reporting standard is a framework developed by property companies to promote transparency in sustainability reporting. Landsec has won a gold award for EPRA disclosure every year since 2014.
We report on 15 EPRA Environmental Sustainability Performance Measures, covering energy consumption, GHG emissions, water usage, waste generation and treatment method and sustainability certificate attainment.
Each EPRA impact area is reported on in two portfolios; absolute and like-for-like.
— Absolute portfolio: The absolute portfolio includes all properties where Landsec has ‘operational control’, where we purchase energy or appoint agents who control the purchase of energy. In 2018/19, approximately 84% of all portfolio was under our ‘operational control’, and therefore included in the absolute portfolio disclosures.
— Like-for-like portfolio: The like-for-like portfolio is aligned with our financial reporting like-for-like portfolio, based on the EPRA Financial BPR like-for-like definition for rental growth reporting. It includes all properties which have been in the portfolio for at least 12 months prior to the reporting period, but excluding those which were acquired, sold, or included in the development pipeline at any time since. In 2018/19, approximately 82% of all like-for-like portfolio was under our ‘operational control’, and therefore included in the like-for-like portfolio disclosures.
We also report on seven EPRA Social Performance Measures at corporate level, including employee diversity, training, development, employee turnover and health & safety. Figures associated with EPRA Governance Performance Measures are disclosed in the Annual Report on pages 64-80.

Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
Our approach to climate risk and opportunity This section of our Performance and Data report responds to the recommendations of the Task Force on ClimateRelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Here you can find a comprehensive account of our approach to climate risk and opportunity.
Our position on TCFD We are committed to implementing the recommendations of the TCFD, providing our stakeholders and investors accurate data and insight about the climaterelated risks and opportunities which are relevant to our business. We’ve made a public commitment to assessing and mitigating climate change risks across our portfolio and are one of 580 organisations publicly listed by the TCFD as supporters.
Our approach to climate risk and opportunity is discussed in our Annual Report on pages 40-41, and as part of our principal risks and uncertainties section on page 59. For further disclosures you can access our CDP response at https://www.cdp.net/en.
Governance Our Chief Executive has overall responsibility for climaterelated risks and opportunities. The Board receive an annual briefing on our sustainability programme which includes discussion of risks and opportunities. Ongoing oversight of climate-related issues is carried out by our Sustainability Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive. Our Sustainability Committee is comprised of our Director of Corporate Affairs and Sustainability and our Group HR Director – both members of our Executive Committee – together with our Head of Sustainability, Public Affairs and Health, Safety & Security and senior representation from our portfolio management, development and finance functions.
The committee meets quarterly and is the senior forum for determining our sustainability strategy and reviewing performance. This includes responding to climaterelated opportunities such as investment in renewables, improvements in energy efficiency and investment in low-carbon technologies. The committee has oversight for climate-related risks including policy, regulatory and legal risks, as well as the physical risks to our assets. The committee also approves and reviews research and analysis to determine our response to climate-related risks and opportunities.
Our Sustainability Committee is supported by our Investment Committee, London Executive Committee and Retail Executive Committee. Each committee reviews the risks opportunities as described above. This can include reviewing and approving investment in energy efficiency projects and renewables, as well as approving development or refurbishment plans which include climate-related aspects of design.
Our commitment to address climate-related risks is embedded across the business, through an energy reduction Group KPI. The performance against this KPI is linked to executive and management remuneration, aiming to incentivise progress against our science-based carbon reduction target and energy efficiency commitment.
Identifying risks and opportunities As an owner and operator of property, our business is exposed to both risk and opportunity from climate change. The nature and level of risk is dependent on government, business and society’s response in the short and long term. In the event of a strong response to climate change in the short term up to 2030, our business will be affected in positive and negative ways by the transition. With a limited response to climate change, our business will be affected in the long term past 2030 by physical effects such as extreme weather and higher temperatures. Accordingly, our analysis focuses on both transitional risks up to 2030 and physical risks past 2030.
To determine how our business may be affected by the physical risk, we conducted research and modelling. This research was carried out in 2017 and 2019. The modelling has enabled us to determine the likelihood of potential future weather patterns and natural hazards. The risks occurring due to these weather and climate patterns include chronic factors such as energy costs from overheating, and acute factors such as windstorm, and coastal, inland and flash flooding. Our exposure to these risks is derived through analysis of our property portfolio, using climate and natural hazard databases such as SwissRe CatNet™ and MunichRe NATHAN™, and is further adjusted based on expert judgement. The research and analysis carried out in 2019 incorporated the Met Office Climate Projections 2018 (UKCP18), which are widely accepted as the most accurate forecasts for how climate change will affect the climate and weather in the UK.
The modelling of all chronic and acute physical risks was based on the four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), which are used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to illustrate future concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Although our modelling analysed all four RCPs, we simplified our approach by focusing on two distinct scenarios, a best-case scenario where global average temperature increases by less than two degrees in line with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, and a worst-case scenario, where temperatures increase by up to four degrees.
To determine how our business will be affected by a transition to the low-carbon economy, we conducted quantitative and qualitative scenario analysis, using the TCFD recommendations as a guide. The process of scenario analysis was designed to allow us to assess our resilience in two alternate futures, transition to the low-carbon economy or failure to transition. This process relied on a variety of data sources and a panel of experts including insurance, strategy, finance, insight and treasury functions from our business, alongside weather, natural catastrophe, enterprise risk management and academic research representatives from Willis Towers Watson and the Willis Research Network.


26 Sustainability Performance and Data 2019. 
Risks and opportunities in the following categories were considered: policy & legal, reputation, technology, and market. Risks and opportunities were assessed against impact and likelihood criteria, with potential impacts across our value chain considered. Preparatory analysis to determine the potential nature of the risks was undertaken by the Enterprise Risk Management team from Willis Towers Watson, through research, gathering insights and constructing the framework for analysis.
The quantitative scenario analysis, carried out in 2017 and 2019, assesses the physical risks of climate change and informs our strategic and financial planning processes where relevant. The qualitative scenario analysis, carried out in March 2019 and assessing broader qualitative factors, will inform our planning in the year ahead.
Strategy and financial planning Our response to climate-related risks and opportunities spans all areas of our business including investment, development, operation and divestment. Considering the potential different scenarios, we may experience due to climate change, our response will need to change. Please find more detailed analysis on our response to the two, and four-degree scenarios on the following pages. Common to both scenarios is a set of practises which we’ll continue to carry out: — Through our Responsible Property Investment Policy, we assess energy efficiency and climate risks when we buy new assets. We undertake risk assessments of developments where necessary to ensure resilience to physical risks from climate change such as windstorm and flooding.
— Through our Sustainability Brief for developments, we manage the risks presented by higher cooling costs and lower heating demand. This includes adapting building services design, reducing heating capacity and maintaining summer cooling capacity to cope with heatwaves.
— Using our Sustainability Charter, we encourage our partners to improve their preparation and response to climate-related risks where this is relevant to their business. We have also included these criteria in the selection and engagement process for partners and plan to work with them in the year ahead to assess and encourage progress.
— We have Energy Reduction Plans (ERPs) for all our assets, which outline how we will reduce the energy use and carbon emissions of the asset effectively. Through these plans, we will continue to plan and deliver improved controls and efficient energy systems. The ERPs form part of the operational financial planning for each asset.
— We actively invest in our renewable energy generation capacity to improve our resilience, reduce carbon emissions and reduce operational costs. We have multiple renewable energy projects undergoing feasibility studies, and ensure renewables are included at the early stages of design for new developments.
Our ongoing approach to risk Our risk management and control framework enables us to effectively identify, evaluate and manage climaterelated risk. We recognise the importance of identifying and monitoring climate-related risks, which feature prominently on our principal risk register.
Ownership and management of all risks is assigned to members of the Executive Committee, who are responsible for ensuring the operating effectiveness of the internal control systems and for implementing key risk mitigation plans. The Executive Committee is supported by risk champions across the business, who are tasked with maintaining awareness of key risks and control measures.
Our Executive board director responsible for climaterelated risk is Miles Webber, Director of Corporate Affairs & Sustainability. Our sustainability principal risk includes including energy transition and physical climate risk and is monitored on a quarterly basis using a series of Key Risk Indicators.
Both the Executive Director and Risk Champion responsible for climate-related risk ensure integration with the overall risk management process. Where climate-related risks correspond to other risks these are discussed between the network of risk champions.

Two degrees scenario. 
This scenario is aligned with the IPCC’s RCP 2.6, in which there is a high likelihood that global temperatures will not exceed more than 2°C over pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. This scenario unfolds between 2019 and 2030, and in this time period global efforts to mitigate climate change intensify immediately, led and supported by strong policy, regulatory and legal responses.
For this scenario to be possible, rapid investment in low-carbon technology will need to occur, with widespread adoption of sustainable consumption, business practices and lifestyles. Businesses not responding to the transition to a low-carbon economy will quickly become laggards, suffering from reputational impacts as the world changes significantly before 2030.
Beyond 2030 in this scenario, the world will have transitioned successfully to a low-carbon economy but will still be affected by high levels of carbon already in the atmosphere. This concentration of emissions will cause an additional one to two degrees of warming over pre-industrial levels, resulting in some physical changes to climate and weather.
Transition risk. 
What could happen in this scenario in the lead up to 2030? — Our customers and communities adopt low-carbon lifestyles — New policy leads to higher development and operational costs — Infrastructure installation costs increase to support electric vehicles. 
In this scenario, zero carbon legislation, planning regulation or a carbon tax could lead to higher capital and operational costs. Investment in low-carbon and renewable construction materials and solutions could be required through the planning system and building regulations. Reducing the carbon impact of developments in both construction and operations could become mandatory, increasing capital expenditures in construction. We would be likely to incur increasing infrastructure and energy costs through widespread adoption of electric vehicles, battery storage technology and other electrical generation, distribution and storage equipment.
Mass adoption of sustainable business practices could begin to occur in this scenario throughout the property industry in the UK. This could lead to marginally diminished competitive advantage which we currently benefit from through our sustainability programme. For example, all new assets brought to market would have compelling sustainability and energy performance credentials, and all retail and leisure destinations would feature electric vehicle charging. This would lead to the requirement for new and innovative technologies and systems to compete for higher rents and valuations. This scenario could lead to higher levels of competition for positive investor favour surrounding ESG, as the standard of disclosure and performance will likely be universally higher.
Opportunities. 
How could we benefit from the low-carbon transition in the lead up to 2030? — Higher revenues for sustainable assets from customers — Higher asset valuation and lower cost of capital — New subsidies and tax relief for low-carbon solutions. 
In this scenario, the global adoption of ESG and responsible investment practices could lead to higher valuations and improved availability of capital for lowcarbon businesses in the short term. New revenue streams could emerge from investment in renewable energy generation, supported by subsidies or tax relief. We expect property companies offering low-carbon solutions could also benefit from increased capacity to attract customers and improved customer retention.
This scenario could also lead to a long-term benefit after 2030, where our present levels of adoption of low carbon and energy efficiency technologies lead to increased organisational resilience. Specifically, the short payback period and longer asset life of renewable energy generation assets would begin to increase our revenues and avoided costs.
Physical risk In this scenario, predicted changes in the UK climate are for marginally higher year-round temperatures and lower precipitation in summer. The risk to our business under this scenario from flooding and windstorm remains within the current and natural variability. This means there will be no material change to insurance, repair or other capital and operational costs arising due to the physical impacts of climate change. Our modelling has also determined this will not have a material effect on energy costs for our business or our customers, particularly as there are a several factors which affect energy consumption and costs. In addition, the slight increase in summer cooling costs are offset by lower heating costs in winter.
How we’ll need to respond In the two degrees scenario, based on our analysis, we are confident our current business model allows us to reduce our impact in line with the required mitigation. Our analysis gives us confidence that our business activities, strategy and financial planning mean we are well placed to benefit from the transition to a low carbon economy through to 2030. This includes widespread adoption of low-carbon and renewable technologies, continually driving improved energy efficiency, and engaging our customers and consumers on sustainability and climate change.
We believe our investment in, and development of resilient and efficient assets will help us to mitigate any marginal increase in physical climate risks after 2030. However, we must consider that under this scenario many of our activities will be considered business as usual by 2030, so to continue to derive both reputational and competitive advantage from our sustainability programme, further innovation and investment will be required. We will continue to do this through seeking new product and service offerings from the market and encouraging our consulting and design partners to build in transitional thinking to their advice to us.

Four degrees scenario. 
This scenario is aligned with the IPCC’s RCP 8.5, where climate change will increase by up to four degrees by 2100. In the lead up to 2030, limited actions are taken to mitigate climate change, current levels of investment in low-carbon technology continue, and emissions continue to rise along their current trajectory. In the period between 2030 and 2100, the physical effects of climate change begin to intensify rapidly, and government, business and society will need to adapt to the effects.
Beyond 2030, widespread disruption to markets could begin to occur, and investment in climate change resilient technologies and infrastructure is likely to be required for organisations with physical assets. The policy, regulatory and legal response, although limited in the short term, could begin to force organisations in control of physical assets to adapt to climate change. In this scenario, businesses with high levels of carbon emissions could experience a backlash in consumer, customer and investor sentiment.
Physical risks and their impacts. 
What could happen in this scenario by 2070? — 5.4°C hotter in summer — 50% increase in heatwaves — 35% more rain in winter — 9% increase in electricity use — 32% decrease in gas use. 
In this scenario it is likely we will experience an increase in flash flooding, river floods, coastal flooding and storm surges. These weather events are applicable to a small proportion of assets in our portfolio, noted in the Metrics and Targets section of this report. Increases in year-round temperature are predicted, with summer temperatures at 5.4°C higher and winter temperatures at 4.2°C higher than the current climate. Higher levels of precipitation are predicted in winter at up to +35%, and lower levels of summer precipitation are predicted at down to -47%.
These physical effects could have several effects on our business due to changes in markets, policy, regulation and technology. Accordingly, we do not consider the consequences of these physical risks to be ‘transition’ risks, as under the four-degree scenario there will be very little transitional activity. We consider these risks and associated impacts to be costs of adapting to the new climate and weather patterns.
In this scenario, the physical risks to our portfolio could pose several market challenges, including potential lower asset values, higher operational costs, higher costs of insurance premiums, and reduced attractiveness to our customers and consumers. Specifically, asset values could fall where they are proven to have poor resilience to windstorm and flooding. Where we own assets in cities, particularly London, we could experience reduced demand for our properties affected by extreme heat and air pollution.
Due to the extreme temperature and weather patterns associated with this scenario, it is likely that poorly designed, operated and maintained assets will experience more frequent building system and envelope failures. This is likely to lead to higher operational costs, but also reputation risks, where customers begin to rely more on property companies to maintain safe and comfortable spaces for their staff and consumers. More extreme weather could also lead to increasing numbers of building failures and natural catastrophes, leading to rising insurance premiums.
In this scenario our business could also be affected by higher raw material costs due to increasing fossil fuel and water costs, disruption to logistics and higher cost of production from taxes and levies. Similarly, we will experience higher construction costs arising from climate change resilient facades and building services with increased capacity.
In the long-term under this scenario, a widespread decrease in combustion-engine vehicle use could lead to assets without good public transport links becoming less attractive to consumers. Consumers and our direct customers could develop greater awareness and expectations of property businesses, pressurising them to act on climate-related issues, and creating greater favour for destinations which are sustainable.
Opportunities Owing to the nature of this scenario, there are only limited opportunities as the impacts are predominantly negative for most business types. We could experience higher levels of customer and investor demand for resilient assets which can withstand the increasing frequency of windstorm and flooding. In addition, falling asset values and business failures could lead to opportunity for more resilient businesses to gain increasing market share.
How we’ll need to respond In this scenario, our analysis demonstrates that changes to our strategy and financial planning will be required. This will include divestment of assets which are less resilient to extreme heat and rainfall, or investment into infrastructure to limit the impact of flooding and coastal surge. We believe our strategy for investing in high-quality assets in primary locations will continue to be resilient in this scenario. However, to maintain an effective strategy we will need to increase our prioritisation of climate change factors in investment, development and divestment decisions.
This scenario could also result in changes to our customers’ and supply chain partners’ businesses, as well as consumer preferences. To continue to be resilient in this scenario, we will need to constantly reassess the risks posed by climate change to ensure we are not exposed to risk of default from business failures or supply chain disruption. Increased due-diligence in supply chain selection will be required, particularly considering the sourcing of construction materials which may be processed or manufactured in countries where the effects of climate change are more extreme.

31 Sustainability Performance and Data 2019. 
Independent Assurance Statement to the Management of Land Securities Group PLC. 
We have performed a limited assurance engagement on selected performance data and qualitative statements in the Physical and Social sections of the Strategic Report, the sustainability content in the ‘Additional Information’ section of the Land Securities Group PLC (“the Group”) 2019 Annual Report and Accounts and the online Landsec Performance Data Report 2019 (collectively referred to as “the Report”).
Respective responsibilities. 
The Group’s management are responsible for the collection and presentation of the information within the Report. Management are also responsible for the design, implementation and maintenance of internal controls relevant to the preparation of the Report, so that it is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Our responsibility, in accordance with management’s instructions, is to carry out a ‘limited level’ assurance engagement on selected data and performance claims in the Report (‘the subject matter information’). We do not accept or assume any responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person or organisation. Any reliance any such third party may place on the Report is entirely at its own risk.
What we did to form our conclusions. 
Our assurance engagement has been planned and performed in accordance with ISAE3000 (Revised)1. The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgement and included the steps outlined below: 1. Interviewed a selection of the Group’s management to understand the progress made in the area of sustainability during the reporting period and to test the coverage of topics within the Report.
2. Conducted a site visit at Gunwharf Quays to understand how the sustainability agenda is being managed at the site level.
3. Reviewed the coverage of key issues within the Report against the topics discussed in our management interviews and site visits.
4. Interviewed staff responsible for data reporting and carried out the following activities to review selected sustainability data: i. Reviewed the guidance on data reporting, key processes and quality assurance performed.
ii. Selected a sample of data points from across the business and sought documentary evidence to support the data.
iii. Conducted a walk-through of data reported from a sample of sites to test consolidation.
iv. Reviewed any explanations provided for significant variances.
v. Reviewed the Report for the appropriate presentation of the data including limitations and assumptions.
Our review of data processes was limited to the following selected data sets: — Greenhouse gas emissions: Direct GHG emissions (MtCO2e), Indirect GHG emissions (MtCO2e), and GHG intensity from building energy (tCO2e/m2/ year) — Waste: Waste diverted from landfill (tonnes) and percentage of waste recycled — Safety: number of reportable RIDDOR incidents for Landsec’s managed portfolio — EPRA and TCFD: Selected content disclosures relating to EPRA guidelines and TCFD metrics (Energy/Fuel and GHG emissions categories) that are aligned to the specific sustainability Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) identified above.
5. Reviewed information or explanation about selected statements and assertions regarding the sustainability performance of the Group.
The limitations of our review. 
Our evidence gathering procedures were designed to obtain a ‘limited level’ of assurance (as set out in ISAE3000 Revised) on which to base our conclusions. The extent of evidence gathering procedures performed is less than that of a reasonable assurance engagement (such as a financial audit) and therefore a lower level of assurance is provided.
Completion of our testing activities has involved placing reliance on the Group’s controls for managing and reporting sustainability information, with the degree of reliance informed by the results of our review of the effectiveness of these controls. We have not sought to review systems and controls at the Group beyond those used for selected sustainability data sets (as presented above).
We have only sought evidence to support the 2018/2019 performance data. We do not provide conclusions on any other data from prior years.


32 Sustainability Performance and Data 2019. 
Our conclusions. 
Based on the scope of our review our conclusions are outlined below:
Completeness and accuracy of performance information How complete and accurate is the ‘selected data’ presented in the Report? — With the exception of the limitations identified in the report, we are not aware of any material reporting units that have been omitted from the selected data relating to the topics above.
— Nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the data relating to the above topics has not been collated properly at Group level.
— We are not aware of any errors that would materially affect the data as presented in the Report.
How plausible are the statements and claims within the Report? We have reviewed information or explanation on selected statements regarding the Group’s sustainability activities presented in the Report and we are not aware of any misstatements in the assertions made.
Observations and areas for improvement. 
Our observations and areas for improvement will be raised in a report to the Group’s management. Selected observations are provided below. These observations do not affect our conclusions on the Report set out above.
— Reporting boundaries – Due to different reporting requirements, Landsec uses three reporting boundaries and definitions (absolute, corporate target and like-for-like) to disclose energy, carbon and waste performance across its portfolio. Landsec should consider further simplification. This could include ensuring greater consistency in definitions between energy and waste, streamlining related performance disclosures and simplifying the basis on which targets are set. Landsec has taken steps to enhance transparency and understanding of year on year carbon performance through the inclusion of waterfall charts to explain the different drivers of performance and has provided more clarity on the different boundaries used across energy, carbon and waste reporting.
— Safety – This is the first year that Landsec has sought assurance over its reported. 
RIDDOR incidents for managed assets. While there are clear processes and controls that support this KPI, Landsec should consider including safety trend reporting data such as year on year performance and highlight reasons for significant changes to further increase transparency. Additionally, Landsec should consider assurance over additional aspects of its safety performance, namely contractor safety at its development sites, in line with peer reporting.
Our independence. 
We have implemented measures to comply with the applicable independence and professional competence rules as articulated by the IFAC Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants and ISQC12. Ernst & Young’s independence policies apply to the firm, partners and professional staff. These policies prohibit any financial interests in our clients that would or might be seen to impair independence. Each year, partners and staff are required to confirm their compliance with the firm’s policies.
We confirm annually to the Group whether there have been any events including the provision of prohibited services that could impair our independence or objectivity. There were no such events or services in 2018/19. Our assurance team has been drawn from our global Climate Change and Sustainability Services Practice, which undertakes engagements similar to this with a number of significant UK and international businesses.
