Sustainability for Us 16 Sustainability for Us 20 From MD’s Desk 24 CSO’s Statement 26 Governance of ESG 28 Our ESG Priorities 31 Materiality Matrix 32 Our Stakeholder Priorities 34 Integrating our ESG Priorities. 
At Adani Power, sustainability is the natural extension of our motto ‘Growth with Goodness’. It refers to the social, environmental and economic responsibility of our operations, and is embedded into our strategy and innovation work at every step.


Several industrial sectors as well as the regional and global economies are undergoing a transformation that is bringing about structural changes. It is making us rethink the ways that available resources are used and helping us look at newer opportunities. At APL, progress and resilience are testimony to the soundness and sustainability of our business model that creates long-term value for all our stakeholders.
With a keen focus on the sustainability trends and based on the impacts that our activities have on our stakeholders and the risks and opportunities presented by these trends, we formulate our strategy. Our approach to mitigating these impacts is based on the Precautionary Principle.
Our long-term strategy and day-to-day action plans are drawn in response to the opportunities and challenges that the external context presents to us. We are re-evaluating our inner strengths and realigning our processes to strengthen our positioning in a rapidly changing external environment.
1. Thermal power significantly contributes to India’s growth. 
The Indian power sector has made significant inroads over the last decade, growing its installed capacity from about 200 GW in FY 2011-12 to about 370 GW in FY 2019-20. In terms of fuel mix, ~62% of total installed capacity and ~76% of total generation is thermal, indicating India’s dependence on conventional fuel sources (Source: CEA). Coal-fired (including lignite) thermal power plants accounted for ~55% of installed capacity.
India’s, peak power deficit decreased from 10.6% in FY 2011-12 to 0.7% in FY 2019-20. However, India’s per capita electricity consumption still remains well below one-third of the global average at 1,181 kWh in FY 2018-19 (Source: CEA).
Commitment to our nation’s growth and especially to its infrastructural requirements is embedded in our vision. We believe, despite the unpredictable business outcomes in the short-to-long term presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, India will be one of the growing consumption centres and business hubs in the decades to come.
Sustainability of our business in the challenging global economic scenario is assured with our focus on India’s growth story, as our businesses are closely aligned to the lifeline of the economy - power, providing essential services and addressing critical national infrastructure priorities.
2. Commitment to mitigating climate change and adapting to its impacts is indispensable. 
India made a commitment at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris that it would lead the climate change revolution; today, it is among the eight nations on track to meet their COP21 commitments. Ensuring that the country’s power deficit is met without compromising on the requirements to mitigate climate risks, APL is taking all the possible measures to minimise its carbon footprint through increased operational efficiency, maintaining fuel quality, reducing specific emissions and adopting best technologies.
Moreover, Adani Group’s commitment towards combating climate change is further attested by the opportunity it identifies in the green energy space. The Group targets achieving an installed generation capacity of 25 GW of renewable power by 2025. We are also exploring all the possibilities of climate adaptation. Strengthening our resilience to climate-related issues cannot be considered independent of economic development priorities; job creation as well as decarbonization must be simultaneous objectives for our business.
3. Pollution standards are rapidly evolving to be more stringent. 
With increased environmental awareness, governments worldwide are increasingly coming up with stringent standards for managing environmental performance. Hence, innovative technology adaptation and timely measures are need of the hour for companies to stay ahead of these compliance requirements.
In December 2015, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) issued the Environment (Protection) Amendment Rules, 2015, setting specific limits on water and stack emissions from thermal power plants for SOx, NOx, Particulate Matter (PM) and mercury. Accordingly, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) mandated all operating power plants to install suitable devices to achieve the new emission standards. These requirements entail technology upgradation like flue-gas desulphurization (FGD) installation.
We, at APL, are prepared to completely abide by these regulations. Our continuous online emission monitoring system is functional at all our sites and the data is continually shared with the Central Pollution Control Board.

4. Water stress presents significant impediment to smooth operations. 
Coal-based thermal power generation is a resource intensive process and also requires water in large quantities for cooling and other processes. Water being a shared resource, we are demonstrating responsibility towards managing water efficiently not only in the plant premises but also in managing this shared resource with our communities.
Moreover, our coastal operation at Mundra and Udupi use sea water, thereby minimising usage of surface water resources. For hinterland, operations as well as operations located near pitheads we are aware of the water stress that might be prevalent in the respective areas; hence, optimising water usage and responsibly sharing water resources and encouraging water conservation in the watersheds is our primary objective. At the same time, we recycle our effluents and use the treated water completely within the plant premises.
5. Ensuring workers’ health, safety and well-being becomes important while transitioning to a new industrial order. 
Providing equal opportunities of employment and ensuring fair and safe working conditions to all our employees and contract labourers are the basic premises on which are human resources policies and practices are built. The coal-based thermal power operations are at an interesting juncture of transition. Whereas on one hand, we prepare our workforce to meet the demands of an increasingly changing technical requirements of the new digitized era and Industry 4.0, on the other, we need to ensure that the occupational health and safety and other requirements of the conventional operations are not compromized.
6. Sustainable value-creation for communities is core to long-term sustainability. 
A harmonious partnership with the communities we serve is based on our efforts of creating shared value for the communities. We also ensure that our CSR programmes are aligned with community’s needs. APL’s approach to nation-building is reflected in all the CSR programmes that are designed to uplift community living standards and meeting needs of education, health, livelihood, community infrastructure and thereby truly empowering them.
7. Investors and the larger stakeholder fraternity are looking for ESG integration. 
Our responsibility towards our stakeholders is not just in creating financial value but also how we are creating this value. We ensure that the environmental, social and governance considerations are mainstreamed in our business decisions. We use the ESG lens not only to monitor performance but also to proactively identify risks and address them accordingly.
Our efforts are concentrated on disclosing information on our future-readiness and preparedness for a world that demands transition in conventional ways of running business. Some of the world-renowned investor-driven initiatives that we are voluntarily part of are CDP and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.
8. Business continuity in the face of COVID-19 is a challenge. 
An unprecedented global pandemic like the COVID-19 has made us introspect and provided us with multiple opportunities for innovation. This pandemic crisis has further reinforced the criticality to have systematic risk mitigation plans in place. Both optimal capital structures and risk mitigation are a part of the maturing of the business philosophies as they grow in size and lay the foundation for stability as well as consistent value creation. While we may have to do need-based course correction in our strategies in the wake of the challenge that we are facing, the roadmap remains clear for business continuity and prosperity.

From MD’s Desk. 
Anil Sardana Managing Director (w.e.f. 11th July, 2020)
Dear Stakeholders,
It gives me great pleasure to present to you our ESG Report for the FY 2019-20, the sixth such report published by us to date. The Report indicates how we have invested in India’s energy infrastructure sustainably and responsibly. We are shaping the future of energy through innovation and investment in clean energy for the benefit of our customers.
The report includes examples of how we demonstrated our commitments and applied our management approach on a range of ESG topics, including environmental stewardship, health & safety, community relations, and governance. The combination of our governance practices, talented workforce, and sustainable business model is what has provided us with the having played our role as a sustainable energy company, with the best skills and capabilities across the industry.
FY 2019-20 in brief. 
Our business model promotes the UN Sustainable Development Goals and is in line with the Group’s overall vision of nation-building and creating sustainable value for all our stakeholders. Our thermal power plants are equipped with industry-leading supercritical or ultra-supercritical technologies, which makes it possible for us to meet the energy needs of the nation, while combating climate change. Today, APL is the largest private-sector independent power producer, contributing 5.36% of India’s installed thermal power generation capacity. APL now operates 12,450 MW of generation capacity under its subsidiaries, that are Adani Power Mundra Limited (APMuL) at Mundra, Gujarat, Adani Power Maharashtra Limited (APML) at Tiroda, Maharashtra, Adani Power Rajasthan Limited (APRL) at Kawai, Rajasthan, Udupi Power Corporation Limited (UPCL), Udupi, Karnataka Adani Power Jharkhand Limited (APJL), Godda, Jharkhand. During the year, we completed the acquisition of two operational power plants – Raipur Energen Limited (REL) at Raipur, Chhattisgarh; and Raigarh Energy Generation Limited. (REGL) at Raigarh, Chhattisgarh with the idea of improving their efficiency too.
Power demand in India grew at a much slower pace of 1.2% during FY 2019-20, primarily due to a slowdown in economic growth. This was also owing to lower electricity demand in the agriculture sector on account of heavy monsoons across the country. In such a scenario, our well-diversified portfolio with 74% of generation capacity tied up with long-term PPAs provided strong revenue visibility. The power demand improved towards the closing of the financial year, underlining India’s deeprooted economic resilience and strong growth drivers. We are pleased to have contributed to this growth story.
During FY 2019-20, our average PLF was higher at 68% as compared to 64% in the previous year owing to higher customer demand, especially in the states of Maharashtra and Rajasthan. Implementation of the Supplementary Power Purchase Agreements in Gujarat strengthened our power sale position. We achieved a 16% growth in units sold in FY 2019-20 at 64.1 Billion Units (BUs), compared to 55.2 BUs in FY 2018-19. Incremental addition of power sales of REL and REGL helped achieve higher growth in FY 201920. Our total revenue for FY 2019-20 stood at ` 27,842 crore, which was 5.6% higher over revenues of ` 26,362 crore during FY 2018-19. Adjusting for the exceptional and one-time revenue recognition as well as additional provisioning, normalized EBITDA for FY 2019-20 was ` 6,104 crore, an increase of 32% over the normalized EBITDA of ` 4,611 crore in the previous year of FY 2018-19.
Prepared for unprecedented changes. 
In many ways, FY 2019-20 was a year of unprecedented changes in terms of businesses waking up to the new world order and the risks, on which there is consensus at various levels including the Global Risks identified by the World Economic Forum. The developments in the macroeconomic environment caused by the pandemic situation, climate change, extreme weather, delicate interactions between the business and biodiversity, world outlook towards digital innovation, and data privacy, alongside changing geopolitical balances, have been among the principal forces motivating enterprises to innovate and immunise their business model.
Adani Power Limited has an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) system in place to ensure business continuity and value creation in line with the vision of the Company. Considering the dynamic nature of the macro business environment, a systematic ERM ensured the identification of emerging risks and the development of associated management plans. Our risk management process aimed at supporting the delivery of the Group’s strategy by managing all risks that can impact the assumptions for the business and value generation process. Ensuring the supply of power and availability of critical infrastructure during the COVID-19 crisis has been a testimony of our systematic ERM.
For climate change mitigation, we believe that responsible action and innovation are the only ways forward. The Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) from our Government has been submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). As per this NDC, India intends to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33-35% by 2030, from its 2005 levels. Further, the Government has set a target of achieving 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030, as per the National Action Plan on Climate Change.
At the Group level, we see Adani Power Limited as part of the Adani Energy Business vertical, where two other separate legal entities that are Adani Green Energy Limited and Adani Transmission Limited operate in the space of renewable energy generation. 
Our total revenue for FY 2019-20 stood at ` 27,842 crore, which was 5.6% higher over revenues of ` 26,362 crore during FY 2018-19 ability to create long-term sustainable value for our stakeholders.
We have supported the grid by catering to the baseload, to enable all resources and technologies, ensure access to reliable and secure power, reduce our environmental footprint, and support sustainable economic growth for the communities.
Amid these extraordinary times, we remained committed as ever to our long-term strategy. In response to the evolving practices and this year’s pandemic, we acted with determination and took concrete actions to ensure that we continue to do our best work towards meeting India’s energy demand. We delivered outstanding value to our customers, supported our communities, and empowered our teams, all this while.

ESG Report 2019-20. 
Growth with Goodness 22 23 and T&D, respectively. The energy portfolio within Adani Energy Business vertical is being made more futureready by having an optimal energy mix to ensure reliable power supply to the grid and customers. By generating thermal power, within the portfolio of Adani Power Limited, we have been contributing to the stability of the grid to leverage the future potential growth of renewables in the country. During FY 2019-20, our GHG emissions were recorded at 0.85 tCO2/MWh, keeping us well on course to achieve the internal target of 0.84 tCO2/MWh by 2025.
APL has been disclosing its GHG emissions in the public domain from FY 2014-15. APL has also disclosed its Climate Change mitigation and Water Security approach for the first time through CDP 2020. All the company’s operating power plants have an energy efficiency target under the Perform Achieve Trade (PAT) mechanism of Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) under the Ministry of Power, Government of India. Our better-than-PAT target performance has enabled two of our plants to generate energy saving certificates (EScerts) which are tradable instruments, as an incentive for higher energy efficiency performance.
Conserving the world’s most precious resource. 
We recognise the importance of conserving water. Also, water being one of the most precious shared resources, we optimized water use not only within our plants, but also extended our water conservation practices beyond the boundaries of our operations. We use the India Water Tool developed by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), which brought together datasets and risk indicators from the Government of India and other institutions, to help users understand their water risks and plan conservation and management interventions accordingly. We also used the GISbased tool Aqueduct developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) to help us in water risk assessment. Water Source Sustainability has been one of the fundamental decision-making criteria for us for the selection of the location for our thermal power plants. As selection of location and siting of our projects has been a major business decision in Adani Power Limited, ESG considerations are integrated for such decisions, which is demonstrated by us by conducting a prior study of competing usage of water downstream of our hinterland power plants before the finalization of the site. During operations, we planned our water conservation activities and watershed development activities backed by scientific information.
Our operating plant at Tiroda is one of the hinterland plants, where we source water from a river. We have identified a water risk at this location, that may happen once in 50 years, based on a scientific study. At Tiroda, we have been working towards better watershed management. Our continuous efforts towards de-silting and cleaning community water ponds have resulted in improved groundwater recharge. To continue our operations without eroding natural capital, water storage capacity was augmented to cater to 53 days of operations required for the Tiroda plant and 23 days for the Kawai plant. This was aimed at preventing possible loss of generation due to the paucity of water during the lean season. Besides, we have initiated rainwater harvesting at our all plants that have resulted in harvesting 9.88 million m3 rainwater in FY 2019-20.
In India, for surface water consumption at thermal power plants, there is a regulatory limit of 3.5 m3/MWh. We have set a stricter internal target i.e. 2.5 m3/ MWh of surface water consumption for our hinterland power plants. For seawater consumption, though there is no regulatory limit, we have set an internal target of 9.5 m3/MWh at plants with seawater-based Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) and 6 m3/MWh at plants without seawater-based FGD. During the year, we have performed well within our Internal target for seawater consumption as well.
Besides, our efforts for optimising the use of natural resources, waste, and bioproducts utilization, especially the fly ash utilization, is our focus area. During the year, we have improved utilization of fly ash and performed better national average utilization of the current fly ash utilization. This continues to remain one of our key challenge to address, as we go further.
Innovation and new technology. 
We realise that innovation and the use of new technology are needed to be competitive and efficient in the thermal power section also. Sonic soot blowers were installed in boilers to reduce ash accumulation at gooseneck areas of furnaces. Plants also installed turbine fast cooling devices to reduce turbine downtimes. Thermography of coal stockpiles has been carried out to identify hot spots in coal stockpiles, to prevent coal fires at yards at all plants, and to eliminate energy loss. A comparative study between UAV Ninja/ Drone and 3D Scanner has been carried at west port Mundra for volumetric measurement to establish the suitability of the technologies.
and engage in succession planning to meet our growth plans. We have genuinely invested in ensuring that we extend a productive and secure work environment that enables people to deliver their best. We also participated in the employee engagement survey conducted by well-known agencies in the world in this space. During the year, we participated in the survey carried out by Gallop, wherein 93% of the employees responded and the results measured by a grand mean score of APL reflected a higher level of employee engagement. To further enhance the engagement, additional initiatives have been taken to provide an enabling environment for our employees.
Empowering the community. 
As a responsible corporate citizen, APL has adopted an inclusive growth model. We are actively involved in the upliftment of the marginalized communities through the Adani Foundation, a non-profit organization focused on the implementation of CSR activities of the Adani Group. Our CSR approach has been to enable the communities and create a deep impact, and leave positive footprints in the areas of education, community health, sustainable livelihood, and community infrastructure. We have identified programs and activities to create a positive impact in these areas.
Our association with Adani Foundation has enabled us to continue the CSR programs and activities on the ground year on year, even if there is any low in the business in any particular year in the company. Although we did not generate any net profit in the reporting year and our contribution to Adani Foundation was limited within the purview of applicable CSR Regulations in India, the CSR programs and activities have continued on the ground for all the APL locations. Adani Foundation has enabled the communities and created impact through its programs that include: ‘Adani Vidya Mandirs’ which is a unique high quality, merit-based education for underprivileged children, and ‘Gyanodaya’ which is an e-learning program to support Government schools for improving quality of education through technology and improving access, ‘Saksham’ which is a Skill Development for underprivileged women in technical skills, ‘SuPoshan’ a program to fight malnutrition and anaemia, ‘Udaan’ to inspire young minds to dream big, ‘Sanghini’ as community. 
Our CSR approach has been to enable the communities and create a deep impact, and leave positive footprints in the areas of education, community health, sustainable livelihood, and community infrastructure. We have identified programs and activities to create a positive impact in these areas.
change agents in rural hamlets, ‘S+5S’ a program to inculcate the culture and behaviour of safety and cleanliness from the tender age of children in schools.
Corporate Governance in focus. 
We have pursued a well-rounded governance structure designed duly keeping in mind the applicable regulatory requirements in the geographies of APL’s operations and international best practices. Context analysis, priority identification for the business as well as our stakeholders, and sustainability planning under the oversight of our experienced Board have been key to our governance framework. The members of the Board of Directors of the company are renowned experts in their field and have vast experience in governance.
At APL, we have codes, policies, procedures for better governance and for upholding the interests of all the stakeholders. Besides the Code of Conduct (CoC) for the members of the Board, we have also established a CoC for all employees and suppliers. Our codes, policies, and procedures also include Board Diversity Policy; Business Responsibility Report Policies; Policy on Material Subsidiaries; CSR Policy; Related Party Transaction Policy; Material Events Policy; Whistle Blower Policy; and Environment, Health & Safety Policy, which are in the public domain and address the key governance areas including anti-corruption and bribery. Besides, we have designated the senior management positions for Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). We have followed the COSO Framework for our ERM, which has enabled the identification of risks and develops mitigation plans for strategic, tactical, and operational risks. Strategic and tactical risks are appraised to the Board of Directors quarterly.
Stakeholder engagement in APL is an alive and ongoing process and we understand this, as if it is a breathing process to the organization. Material ESG issues are identified based on stakeholder engagement and inputs coming from all stakeholders through different channels. Our regular engagement by different functions of APL with the stakeholders goes beyond transactional communication. We have been disclosing our management approach and performance to all our stakeholders through our ESG Report on annual basis and through other periodic public disclosures. To ensure the integrity of our ESG disclosures, we have designated senior management positions for ESG and Sustainability and implemented integrated management systems for Quality, Environment, Health and Safety, and Energy, which is implemented at all our locations.
Our adherence to sound ESG practices has earned us the 30th position at the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) for ESG survey among 153 Electric Utility Companies in the world in 2019. The DJSI is a family of best-in-class benchmarks for investors who have recognized that sustainable business practices are critical to generating long-term shareholder value and wish to reflect their sustainability convictions. This also makes us more committed to growth with goodness.
As we continue to invest in building the nation’s energy infrastructure, I would like to place on record my deep appreciation of our stakeholders who have stood by us. APL has always remained committed to strengthen this bond founded on transparency and shared growth. As we intend to make further investments over the coming years, we will continue to use emerging technology and innovative ways to deliver cleaner and more reliable energy to our customers.
To our people and fraternity of investors, I extend my sincere gratitude for always having demonstrated the utmost belief in the business, which enabled us to ensure continuity of our services and the security of the power system in our areas of operation.
Looking forward to a brighter year ahead of us.

Yours sincerely,
Anil Sardana Managing Director.

Materiality Analysis. 
Our periodic engagement with our stakeholders, robust feedback mechanism developed, understanding of sectoral developments and the experience and understanding of our internal stakeholders lead to identification of issues that matter the most for the Company’s sustainability strategy.
For the purpose of Sustainability Reporting, internally we methodically carry out the materiality assessment process bi-annually. The methodology adopted is based on recognized international standards, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board), standard AA1000APS and the SDG Compass, which helps in following and integrating the 17 UN-SDGs.
The issues are primarily classified into three broad buckets – Environmental Issues, Social Issues and Governance Issues.

Integrating our ESG Priorities. 
An important aspect of considering ESG factors in the key decision-making of the Company is driven by our strategic objectives and priorities. With a defined strategy and an action plan, we are ensuring that the ESG considerations be mainstreamed in all key business decisions. At the same time, they should dynamically respond to the developments in the external environment.
Key Strategic Objectives. 
Minimising GHG emissions is a key strategic objective of our business. By virtue of being engaged in thermal coal production, our primary focus is on minimising GHG emissions by inculcating operational efficiency measures and deploying best-in-class technologies.
We are in the process of setting specific targets and analysing different climate scenarios and their impacts on our business. In 2015, the Company’s GHG emission intensity was 0.87 tCO2e/MWh. The emission intensity in FY 2019-20 was 0.85 tCO2e/MWh. It targeted to achieve 0.84 tCO2e/MWh by 2025.
An extremely important aspect of our future preparedness is our preparation for climate adaptability. Extreme weather conditions such as strong and frequent storms can adversely affect the supply of fuel and damage generation and grid infrastructure. To combat these aspects, we have focused on designing and building plant infrastructure to withstand extreme events, such as cyclones.
Minimising GHG Emissions. 
Focusing on Climate Adaptability. 
Despite being in the conventional thermal power generation business, improved productivity and resource efficiency are key to our long-term sustainability and business continuity. Digitization of our operations is one of our key business objectives through which we aim to continue achieving benchmark performance in terms of plant efficiency and productivity. Moreover, we are preparing ourselves to transition towards Industry 4.0 and adopting AI-based technologies.
Resource efficiency and improved productivity have direct implications on our financial and environmental performance. We keep striving for improved operational efficiency. We have adopted different measures at different plant locations to outperform the operational benchmarks based on the technology deployed. Quality of raw material, equipment health, plant maintenance measures, and implementing innovative solutions for countering any wastage or leakage are some of the key areas of focus for improved efficiency.
We believe in creating a healthy and safe work environment for our people, while providing worldclass working conditions to our employees and creating appropriate learning & development opportunities for them. Our supportive policies encourage diversity at the workplace and create equal opportunities for growth. We also provide the right platform for our workers to interact with the Management and uphold their rights.

Adani Power Limited has been at the forefront in addressing climate change concerns, while also contributing to the nation’s growth by addressing country’s power requirement and fulfilling the deficit. Some of the key initiatives we have adopted in reducing our emissions are summarized below:
We are the first company in India to have commissioned supercritical boilers (December, 2011), which save about 2% of fuel per unit of power generated. 
Mundra TPP has been registered1 as a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project by UNFCCC and has been recognized for saving 1.8 million metric tonnes CO2 equivalent per annum. 
Till date, the Company has commissioned 9,290 MW (12 units of 660 MW each and 2 units of 685 MW) operational power plants, based on supercritical technology. 
All of the Company’s operating power plants are covered under the PAT mechanism and have an energy efficiency target. 
We are considering the utilization of ultrasupercritical units for the upcoming TPPs to further reduce specific GHG emissions. 
APL has reduced 16,526 Million tCO2e through its energy saving activities. 
The Company has responded to the CDP2, a publicly available global disclosure system for investors, companies, for the first time in order to manage their environmental impacts. It has also responded to Climate Change and Water Security Questionnaires 2020.

Steps undertaken towards Climate Change Mitigation Energy efficiency above PAT targets. 
With the implementation of PAT scheme of BEE and its coverage to all of its operating plants, the Company has undertaken many energysaving initiatives. The baseline assessment has been completed for Mundra power plant and is underway for the rest of the plants. Our betterthan-PAT target performance has enabled two of our plants to generate EScerts, and also generate revenue as an incentive for higher energy efficiency performance.
For Mundra TPP, PAT-II Cycle M&V (Measurement and Verification) Audit has been completed in FY 2019-20 and secured 71,189 Energy Saving Certificates.
Energy Management System (EnMS):
Under the Company’s voluntary ISO 50001 targets, a dedicated energy management cell termed as OTS (Operations and Technical Services) drives energy efficiency measures. The proposals for energy efficiency are invited from the respective plant’s teams and analysed for techno-commercial feasibility. Based on the sanctioned budget, projects with the best payback period are approved and assigned to a project implementation team. The progress is periodically reviewed by the OTS and necessary implementation support is extended.
Being committed to climate change. 
The power generation sector is witnessing an increased push for innovation and technology upgradation against the backdrop of growing climate change concerns. At APL, we have constantly demonstrated our commitment towards climate change mitigation by implementing the best available technologies at our power plants, thereby ensuring efficient operations. We pioneered the commissioning of supercritical boilers at our Mundra plant in Gujarat, saving ~2% of fuel per unit of power generated and leading to lower GHG emissions. Till date, we have 9,290 MW (12 units of 660 MW and 2 units of 685 MW) operational power plants based on the supercritical technology. At our 1,600 MW Godda thermal power project in Jharkhand, which is currently under construction, we are now moving towards adopting the next generation Ultra Supercritical technology. Further, for future expansion, we remain committed to deploying the best available technologies to address India’s energy requirements.
We have set an internal target to achieve 0.84 tCO2eq/ MWh of GHG emissions by 2025, and we are constantly striving to achieving this.
Employee Engagement. 
APL has implemented the “MAADHYAM” scheme, a communication channel available to all employees through which they can provide their ideas, suggestions, and insights across strategy, operations, technology, and organization directly to the Chairman.
All employees of the company are motivated by senior leaders to undertake ESG initiatives, which are fostered through various recognitions. At the shop floor level, there are various Kaizens and Quality Circle initiatives that achieve energy efficiency and savings. All the employees are encouraged to give suggestions as a part of Maadhyam scheme and recognized by the senior management.
Infrastructure and Technology. 
We have implemented all appropriate measures to minimise climate change related risks to our assets and operations, while adapting to climate change. Most of our thermal power plants are equipped with either induced draft or natural draft cooling towers with a recirculation system which can function effectively if the water temperature rises. Besides, our plants have inbuilt design and construction safety standards to withstand any kind of adverse impact under different scenarios of climate change.
We have designed and built all power plants and infrastructure to withstand cyclones of up to 198 kmph. With respect to the rising sea levels and cyclonic surges due to global warming, the finished floor level of the Mundra power plant has been raised to 10 m above the Chart Datum (CD), the lowest astronomical tides and mean low water. On the other hand, the highest high tide recorded is 5.4 m above the CD.
FGD is proposed for all sites (Except Mundra Phase#4: U#7,8,9- Sea water based FGD installed already) with wet lime stone based FGD under new MoEFCC Norms guidelines.
For us, operational excellence is about driving a vigour for innovation across the organization, embracing new-horizon bestin-class technologies and implementing internationally recognized management standards. As a thermal power generation company, achieving optimal operational efficiency is at the core of our GHG emissions reduction and climate-change mitigation strategy. It also leads to resource efficiency and directly impacts our value-creation capability. The plethora of awards conferred for excellence in 5S (Workplace Management System), ISO 45000:2018 (OHSAS) and ISO 50001:2018 (EMS), as well as Quality are a testimony to our industry leading practices.

Governance. 
The Sustainability and CSR Committee, and the Risk Management Committee are subcommittees of the Board of Directors.
The Sustainability and CSR Committee oversees the implementation, monitoring, and reporting of climate-related issues, ESG and sustainability performance, along with CSR policies and its implementation.
The ESG risks, of which climate change related risks are a significant part, are identified and continually monitored by the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) System and guided by the Chief Risk Officer. This system is implemented across the Company to enable all the employees and business associates to raise any kind of risk identified by them till the next level. The risk management framework in place has the provision to evaluate, prioritise and escalate the risk to the highest governing body in the organization.
The Committee identifies and incorporates climate-related operational and financial risks through the resolution of the Board of Directors.
The organizational policies, purpose, values, mission statement, strategies, goals, and targets related to sustainable development are developed by the senior management committees. This is based on identified risks and opportunities related to the power sector, external environment, legal, management system requirements, and stakeholder consultation, among others. These policies are regularly reviewed and approved by the Board.
The governance structure, starting from the Board of Directors till the corporate level committees, is developed with the objective of making ESG systematic and intertwining the subject in business decisions. The ESG and climate Change agenda is steered as follows: a) There is an Apex Sustainability Committee (ASC), a body of all functional leaders and site heads at operating locations. ASC is chaired by the CEO and guided by the CSO to develop the management systems for ESG and Climate Change.
b) At the working level and one level below the ASC, there is a Core ESG Working Group, which operates in a cross-functional manner.

All strategic and operational responsibilities, including climate-related issues, sustainability performance and value creation are executed by him. Key indicators of value creation and sustainability performance are monitored and reviewed by the CEO and the results are deliberated at the Board of Directors (the Board) level on a quarterly basis.
The Company has developed a Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) based on COSO (The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) framework. This system is implemented across the company to enable all employees and business associates to raise any risks identified by them till the next level.
The IMS also includes the Energy Management System as per the ISO 50001: 2018, which culminates into various objectives and targeted and management plans for energy efficiency, leading to climate change mitigation.
The Head-ESG, and Sustainability is designated with his role to support the CEO in establishing systems for monitoring, continual improvement, and internalization of the Climate Change and ESG aspects into the business. He also coordinates with ESG Steering Committee and representatives of various management systems for development of the Company’s ESG and Sustainability disclosures and Integrated Report in line with GRI Standards, IFC, SDG, UNGC, and the Integrated Reporting framework.
Strategy. 
Short-term: The Company considers a short-term horizon of five years starting from the current year (FY 2020-21) till FY 2025-26, where the physical and regulatory risks of immediate future are taken into consideration.
Medium-term: A medium-term horizon of 5-10 years will indicate the acceptance of physical change and. 
Market. 
Increasing concerns about climate change and growing international commitments to contain global warming are expected to result in a major policy shift towards renewable sources of energy and energy efficiency. Although the share of coal-based power generation in India is expected to drop in India’s energy mix, we except net capacity additions to maintain the base load in the grid to meet the growing demand. The government has taken several policy initiatives to further boost the load requirement in the grid. Some of these are electricity connection to the remotest corners of the nation, agricultural feeder separation, strengthening of rural grids, and policy fostering the e-vehicle market. At the same time, demand growth has been somewhat muted due to fewer PPAs being signed by DISCOMs in India, despite the government’s initiatives to improve the overall health of the power sector, such as improving domestic coal availability and the performance of DISCOMs.
The Ujjwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) to reduce DISCOM losses is critical to translating increased demand into new PPAs. These initiatives are likely to lead to the signing of more PPAs in the next 3-4 years, and we are well-positioned to leverage this opportunity. Over the past several years, we have stood at the forefront of this capacity-building effort and delivered four world-class power plants supplying electricity at some of the most competitive rates. Under the Indo-Bangla Friendship Treaty of 2010, we are developing a 1,600 MW thermal power plant at Godda in Jharkhand for supplying power under a long-term PPA to the Bangladesh Power Development Board. Godda TPP will be the first thermal Power project in India dedicated to export of Electricity.
Further, with the implementation of PAT and its coverage to most of our operating plants, the Company has taken many energy-saving initiatives. The baseline assessment is completed for the Mundra Power Plant and is underway for the remaining plants. The better than PAT target performance has enabled two of our plants to generate EScerts and revenue as an incentive for the higher energy efficiency performance.
Acute Physical. 
Change in precipitation rates may affect water availability in our hinterland power plants. The Company has conducted the Water Source Sustainability Study for its hinterland plants, which addresses downstream impact assessment and includes water management and conservation plan. All these identified low impacts are a part of the risk management and business continuity plans (BCP). The event-driven risks including increased severity of extreme weather events, such as cyclones, hurricanes and floods are covered under the appropriate insurance policies.
pursue stability to the organization and operations from regulatory and policy changes and assess the required modification or upgradation.
Long-term: A long-term horizon of 10-20 years of the period is considered to achieve the company’s long-term targets.
Current Regulations. 
The Government of India imposed a cess on domestically produced and imported coal as India’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) includes fiscal policies in its climate action toolkit. This includes “instruments like coal cess, cuts in subsidies, increase in taxes on petrol and diesel” (the Republic of India, 2015), and the Company is complying with this regulation.
In addition, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) launched The Perform, Achieve, and Trade (PAT) Scheme. The objective of this scheme is to reduce energy consumption and promote enhanced energy efficiency among specific energy-intensive industries in the country. In the first cycle of this scheme which started in FY 2014-15, and since the second cycle which lasted from 2016 to 2019, all the nominated APL subsidiaries actively participated and got audited periodically.
Emerging Regulations. 
Any upcoming environmental or climate change related regulation in the country is introduced by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC), in consultation with the industry and Ministry of Power. APL is still committed to comply with the statutory requirements and upgrade the systems from time to time. In the future, the limit for CO2 emissions may be introduced in India, which can be met either by a change in existing technology or by carbon trading. This will increase financial liability on the Company for compliance as well as possible violations. The Company is actively participating in various studies/research for the preparedness of the emerging regulation.
Technology. 
The Company has been at the forefront in adopting best-in-class technologies for thermal power generation, thereby ensuring optimum levels of efficiency and mitigating climate change. APL’s Mundra power plant is India’s first super-critical technology-based 660 MW generating unit. APJL, a subsidiary of APL, is installing ultra-supercritical technology which improves energy and resource efficiency.
Tropical storms are continuously monitored, and all probable plants affected are informed and warned. Similarly, Heatwaves’ situations will be alerted to all asset managers to deal with the situation as per the defined procedures.
SOPs for proper early warning systems are developed using state-of-the-art technology tools and applications, and training is imparted to all Asset Management teams.
The below mitigation measures are followed for the identified acute risks:
Continuous monitoring of weather and informing and warning all the probable affected plants for readiness. 
Usage of technology tools to predict and give early warning. 
Routine monitoring of physical assets during windstorms. 
Designed to withstand wind speeds due to tropical storms like cyclones and tornadoes. 
Ensured preparation through SOPs and maintenance checks. 
An emergency response plan is established and mock drills are carried out. 
Chronic Physical. 
The Company recognized the need to get realistic climate projections and evaluate the risks from emerging regulations, physical risk to the critical infrastructure like power plants and T&D lines connecting to the grid, among others. The Company used the IPCC’s RCP 4.5 scenario (equivalent to 1.7-3.20C) and studied the following impacts.
Projected change in Monthly maximum temperature, Monthly precipitation, Severe drought likelihood, Probability of heat/cold wave, Mean drought index, and Land projected to be below the annual flood level.
The initial study included all the power plants, major T&D lines, and supply chain, including logistics. The analysis does not show any significant risk to infrastructure during the study period. All the identified low impacts are a part of the risk management and business continuity plans (BCP).
The projected impacts included low risks from increased temperature affecting water availability and coastal flooding for some plants and ports used in sourcing of coal.
For these sites, appropriate quantification of risk and mitigation measures are being developed. These include maintaining sufficient coal stock during possible high precipitation events and increased water reservoirs to operate the plant, in the event of any water shortage for a few days.

In view of this, the Company addresses the issue of rising sea levels and cyclonic surges due to global warming. Finished floor level of Mundra Power Plant has been raised to 10 m above the Chart Datum (CD), the lowest astronomical tides and mean low water, whereas the highest high tide recorded is 5.4 m above the CD.
To adapt to the increase in water temperatures owing to climate change in the future, all our thermal power plants are equipped with either induced or natural draft cooling towers with a re-circulation system. This will help in maintaining the desired temperature difference across the condenser and ensuring plant efficiency over time.
All the identified risks are validated and prioritized to finalise a risk mitigation and control plan, which is monitored regularly. The risks and mitigation strategies are discussed in the top Management Committees and later presented to the Board. We constantly leverage these opportunities and minimise risks by improving project execution proficiency and operational efficiency. We build on our business strategies based on identified risks and opportunities to meet the needs of diverse stakeholders and remain competitive.
The Company has developed a well-laid Risk Management framework, as per COSO. The substantive financial risks are defined as: ‘Very significant loss due to closure/stoppage of operations beyond 1 day, improper utilization of resources. 
On our Supply Chains:

Resource Efficiency. 
We realise the criticality of optimization of material consumption and have taken adequate measures translating into and delivering value to our stakeholders and communities. We are also taking the requisite measures that help in optimising production costs and reducing burden on the environment by minimising consumption of natural resources and waste generation. The nature of the sector in which we are operating makes it inapplicable for recycled material as an input in manufacturing and reclamation of product. We are committed to adopt continuous measures for effective and efficient use of material resources, thus reducing the burden on the environment. During the said financial year, the Company consumed the following key materials for O&M activities.
Our operations consumed 623.17 million GJ of energy during FY 2019-20, as compared to 537.85 million GJ consumed in FY 2018-19. This was in the form of primary fuels such as coal, HFO and LDO used in boilers and HighSpeed Diesel (HSD) used in vehicles and machinery. In the event of power outage or shutdown activities, we also purchase electricity from the grid. During FY 2019-20, we purchased 17.81 million unit of electricity. The total auxiliary power consumption stood at 18.02 million GJ, as compared to 11.30 million GJ during FY 2018-19.
This Report does not include energy consumed for activities in downstream operations. However, energy consumption and specific GHG emissions from upstream coal transportation are being monitored.
Material Consumption. 
Water conservation and enhancing water resources. 
As a shared resource, water conservation and management at APL is driven by the below factors:
Helps increase efficiency. 
Helps minimise effluent waste. 
Got extended positive impacts on water tables and watershed of the area in which our operations and plants are located. 
Our approach to water conservation can be classified into three broad areas: 1. Optimising water usage within plant operations 2. Treating and using recycled water to minimise outflow of effluents and waste water 3. Enhancing water resources in the watersheds where we operate. 
For our coastal operations, the usage of marine water has already ensured lesser or minimal dependence on ground or surface water. The way we prioritise water conservation is articulated in our Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) Policy.
A major portfolio of the Company is focused on the business of thermal power generation. In our operations, water is principally used to generate superheated steam and power the turbines. Therefore, continued availability of water is of paramount importance. The Company has two seawater-based thermal power generation subsidiaries – APMuL and UPCL. At all the operating power plants, the total water withdrawal is measured with water flow meters at all sources of withdrawal and all storage locations.
We have set an internal target of 2.5 m3/MWh of surface water for our hinterland power plants, which is well within the regulatory limit of 3.5 m3/MWh. Although, there is no regulatory limit on seawater consumption, we have set an internal target of 9.5 m3/MWh at plants with seawater-based Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD); and of 6 m3/MWh at plants without seawater-based FGD. During the reporting year, seawater consumption was 9.29 m3/MWh at the Mundra power plant and 7.73 m3/MWh at the Udupi power plant.

Management System identifies the ways in which the Company’s operations affect its ecosystems and human health. It tracks the reportable EHS events and performs root cause analysis to prevent this from recurring again.
The Company ensures water quality by regularly getting it monitored by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) accredited third party institutes, as per the state regulatory requirements. The water quality report has been submitted to the Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), along with the six-monthly Compliance Report.
Process water for our hinterland plants is being consumed within the plant premises. And hence, we do not anticipate any detrimental impact of this on our water ecosystems or human health.
In case of seawater-based plants, the water is taken through intake channels, which is measured by make-up volume of cooling tower and FGD. The water source intake is metered and flow data compiled monthly and flow volume is calculated based on the time of water intake.
Water quality is a crucial parameter for the efficient operation of thermal power plants. The Company monitors the quality of water withdrawal regularly. It also has desalination plants for its seawater-based plants. Water is treated and its quality is ensured before putting it to operational use.
Optimising water usage within plant operations. 
Water is principally used to generate superheated steam that powers our turbines. We are working to minimise the withdrawal of surface water during the summers. To further enhance water’s productivity, internal assessments are carried out to study the usage patterns, identify leakages and come up with innovative ways to optimise its usage.
Water Risk Management. 
APL uses WRI- Aqueduct for Water stress and drought risk assessment, and India Water Tool developed by World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and partner organizations. These tools bring together the datasets and risk indicators from the Government of India and other institutions, to help users understand their water risks and plan interventions for water management in India.
APL manages the water-related risks in term of regulatory changes in price as well as water availability. (a) As a strategic decision, more than 46% of our total generation capacity comes from the power plants in coastal areas using sea water which is available abundantly and the extraction of which is less likely to be affected by regulations. (b) For the power plants in hinterland areas, we use surface water for operational purpose. (c) Study for source sustainability of surface water availability is conducted based on last 30-50 years data for different scenarios. (d) Long-term water allocations are obtained from Ministry of Water Resources in respective states. (e) Binding agreement to draw water is signed with irrigation departments of the states that gives us a guarantee for water availability at a fixed price for our operations and mitigate the risk of regulatory changes.
The Company is engaged in power generation through its operations of coal-based power plants across India. It carries out Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies for all its projects through NABET accredited agencies and institutes of repute. The EIA has identified and classified potential water pollutants associated with its business. The Company has also implemented an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) to eliminate and mitigate the detrimental impact on water ecosystems, human health and community.
The Company also adopts precautionary approaches through due diligence and a risk identification process. The Integrated.

Enhancing water resources in the watersheds where we operate. 
We use the India Water Tool developed by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and partner organizations. The tool brings together the datasets and risk indicators from the Government of India and other institutions. It helps users understand their water risks and plan interventions for water management in India. The tool provides overall water availability index in six categories ranging between “extremely low” to “extremely high”. The ‘extremely low’, ‘low’ and ‘low to medium’ categories are considered as water-stressed areas for mapping of our power plants.
Three plants of the Company fall in “extremely low” category of overall water availability. These plants are located in APRL at Kawai, and the two recently acquired power plants in Chhattisgarh. The APML plant at Tiroda falls under the “low” water category; APL Mundra falls in “low to medium” category; the APJL plant at Godda falls under the “medium to high” category; while the UPCL plant at Udupi falls in “high” water availability category.
Moreover, the results of the IMD study have guided us in making rational use of surface water. At Tiroda, we are steadfastly working towards better watershed management. De-silting and cleaning community water ponds were one of our interventions to improve groundwater recharge. To continue with the operations without eroding Natural Capital, the water storage capacity has been augmented to cater to 53 days of operations requirement at Tiroda and 23 days at Kawai, to ensure continuity of operations during the lean season.
Rainwater harvesting has been initiated within the plant premises to bring down withdrawal of surface water. At Mundra, rooftop rainwater harvesting is being deployed to recharge groundwater and mitigate seawater ingress. At Kawai and Udupi, rainwater harvesting facilities have been constructed. This utilized 2.2 million m3 and 0.13 million m3 of harvested rainwater, respectively, which was used for plant operations.
Godda – Pond deepening activity. 
Deepening work of 37 ponds has been accomplished in 26 villages with an aim to increase water storage capacity of ponds and the groundwater level. More than 650 acres of agricultural land from 7 villages depends on these ponds for irrigation purposes. However, owing to lack of storage capacity, the pond can provide irrigation to only 100-150 acres of agricultural land. These ponds are excavated for enhancing their water storage capacity by deepening them.
Pond deepening work will enhance crop intensity and irrigation area in more than 1,050 acres of agricultural land, with net increase of 1,01,590 m3 in storage capacity. Apart from agriculture, alternative livelihood options have also increased in the area including livestock development and pisciculture, among others. In addition, the work will boost groundwater levels in wells and borewells in the said area. With availability and increase in water storage, we may introduce scientific methods of agriculture such as SRI methods in paddy and other crops.
Treating and Recycling of Waste Water. 
The total volume of wastewater generated and treated wastewater discharged at Mundra and Udupi plant stood at 224 million m3 and 13.3 million m3, respectively, during the reporting year. The cooling towers at these plants are seawater. Mundra and Udupi are seawater-based and the discharged water is essentially a blowdown of the cooling towers.
We ensure the maintenance of temperature differential within the prescribed limit of 5°C before discharging water from the premises. We have set up an effluent and sewage treatment plant, a coal run-off treatment plant and a secondary Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant.
Besides the core processes, water is required for dust suppression in coal handling and for purging out bottom ash generated in the boilers. We meet our water requirement for secondary processes through recycled and reused water from the water treatment plants.
Rainwater harvested in FY 2019-20 is 9,882,489 m3.

One of the biggest challenges faced today is the disposal, reuse and management of solid waste, primarily fly-ash. We recognise the challenges of solid waste disposal and landfill management.
Fly-Ash management. 
To overcome the challenges presented by flyash and its disposal, we are focused on a multipronged approach. One, changing the nature of the raw material used. This, in our case, implicates usage of better quality coal, with relatively lesser ash content. Two, identifying several innovative and optimal methods of flyash utilization. Three, managing the disposal in a manner which has minimal impact on the surrounding ecosystem.
The Central Government has emphasized the need to optimally use ash from the power plants. Utilization of fly ash can be a challenge for the entire power sector, considering the total quantity of ash generated. At APL, we were able to accomplish an impressive utilization rate of 97.9% by ensuring scientific and environmentally sound disposal during the year.
Considering fly ash to be a useful resource, we developed infrastructure that supports the handling and selling of fly ash. This helped increase our ash supply for utilization to specialized agencies for use in cement manufacturing.
For Mundra, Kawai and Udupi plants, the utilization rates of fly-ash was 100%.
The Company has set a target of achieving 100% utilization of fly ash by 2025, and is continuously striving to achieve the target earlier than that.

In December 2015, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) issued the Environment (Protection) Amendment Rules, 2015. It also set specific limits on water and stack emissions from thermal power plants for SOx, NOx, Particulate Matter (PM) and mercury. Accordingly, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has mandated all the operating power plants to install suitable devices to achieve new emission standards and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) issued directives in this regard. While all our existing operational units are already compliant with the new emission standards for mercury and PM, some of the units are in the process of installing new devices for meeting SOx and NOx emission norms.
During FY 2019-20, we initiated the International Commercial Bidding process for the installation of Flue Gas Desulphirization (FGD) equipment. We are on track to meet the new emission standards for all the power plants, in accordance with the plan laid out by the CEA.

Biodiversity. 
Conserving and protecting life on land and water is the overarching principle guiding our policy and actions on biodiversity management. We also take significant measures to enhance biodiversity in the regions we operate in.
Biodiversity Policy5. 
Endangered flora and fauna within a 10 km radius of our project locations are monitored. This is aimed to ensure that areas of biodiversity significance, protected regions or any red list species based on reports of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) are not affected by the plant operations.
All the operating locations are outside the buffer areas and eco-sensitive zones notified around biodiversity hotspots. This includes wildlife sanctuary, national park and world heritage sites declared under applicable regulations or international treaties ratified by India.
Conservation begins with assessment. 
Assessing the biodiversity impact and risks of our operations is of utmost importance for us to take any measures on biodiversity conservation. In order to carry out these assessments, we partner with multiple national and internationally known experts in the field.

For assessing biodiversity in and around the vicinity of 10 km radius, following assessment is currently in practice for all the operational sites of APL.
Data is collected from 7 villages falling within a radius of 10 km. 
Accounting of total number of species of shrub, herb and tree species is done using the quadrates method. 
Data is collected and maintained for CBH, DBH, radius and basal cover for each tree, shrub and herb species observed during the monitoring. 
Identification and accounting of reptiles, mammals and amphibians is done in the study area. 
The Shannon Diversity Index (H) is being used for characterising species diversity. 
Number of migratory, resident migratory and local bird species in and around the plant premises are also identified. 
The observed bird species are categorized into rare, endangered and threatened, according to the Wild Protection Act and as per the IUCN guidelines. 
Biodiversity protection and enhancement measures. 
Based on the assessments carried out, we have undertaken a plethora of initiatives at different locations addressing the requirements of specific species conservation.
At the Mundra location, we have developed an Eco Park, with an intention to provide shelter and a breeding ground to local and resident birds within an area of approximately 2 ha inside the plant premises. The area is covered with live fencing of Casuarina sp. and Prosopis juliflora plant species. To attract birds, fruitivorus plants such as Sapota (Manilkara zapota), Pomegranates (Punica granatum), Neem tree (Azadirachta indica), Banyan tree (Ficus benghalensis) and Pilu (Salvadora persica) have been planted.
The Eco Park serves as a habitat for reptiles such as frog, lizard and snakes, whereas mammal such as Mangoose are occasionally sighted. A total of 28 local resident bird species have been identified during the monitoring.
Nagzira, New Nagzira and Koka Wildlife Sanctuaries fall within 25 km radius of the Tiroda Plant. In addition to the Environmental Impact Assessment, a separate study was conducted for prediction of impacts on Nagzira Wildlife Sanctuary due to Particulate Matter, gaseous and thermal emissions from the Tiroda Power Plant. This was conducted by an expert external agency in 2011. Besides, site specific wildlife conservation plans have been prepared and implemented.
The Company has set up ambitious targets to create a net positive biodiversity impact at all our operations and projects. At the time of proposing new projects, wildlife and biodiversity studies are also carried out. We are signatory to the Indian Business Biodiversity Initiative (IBBI), a Confederation of Indian Industry initiative.
Moreover, raising awareness biodiversity among the employees is one of the major efforts towards conservation initiatives.
Environmental Compliance. 
During the reporting year, there have been no violations of environmental regulations and there were no cases or litigations against APL on environmental issues.
We have assessed and mapped biodiversity in five of our sites covering total land of 2,007.94 hectares.
Mr. Rambhav Gattu Station Heads – REL & REGL. 
As new additions to APL, the operations at REL and REGL are focused on leveraging the operational strengths, greater fuel availability, and improved cost recovery, thereby delivering valueaccretive growth opportunities. Our primary emphasis will be on efficiency, safety, and sustainability.

We also provide a notice period of minimum four weeks to all our employees before any major operational change is implemented. At our townships, we ensure that our employees and their families are able to enjoy all the amenities required for health, education, entertainment and social well-being.
We comprehend deeply the need to have proper healthcare facilities at our plants since they are situated away from the metropolitan cities. Our plants are equipped with an occupational health centre, ambulance facility with life-support systems, qualified doctors and paramedical staff. We have partnered with reputed service providers to conduct pre-employment and periodic medical examinations for our workforce. A mobile-based application Emcare has been established. This enables our employees to access their health records digitally.
The health centres organise various camps and counselling sessions for the employees and their families to make them aware of the benefits of good health and to address specific healthrelated issues. Some of these programmes cover topics such as Diabetes, Arthritis, Yoga Therapy, Naturopathy, and Vitamin Deficiency, among others.
All our employees and their immediate families are covered under a medical insurance policy, which is also extended to the employees’ parents. The employees undergo preemployment medical check-up before joining the organization. Also, during their tenure, the employees below the age of 45 undergo medical check-ups once in two years. On the other hand, employees above the age of 45 years undergo medical check-ups once a year.
We also organise annual cricket tournaments across all our facilities, encouraging the practice of playing table tennis, basketball, volley ball, badminton, chess, carrom, and other games. These games act as a medium for employees with diverse roles to collaborate and interact with each other, thus helping build the teamspirit.
We also encourage employee participation in various cultural programmes and CSR drives, encouraging a sense of belonging among the employees. These initiatives help in personal growth of our employees and ensure the creation of long-term bonds with the organization.

Awareness sessions are conducted for the employees. 
Do’s and Don’ts have been displayed at all strategic locations on print collaterals and digital platforms. 
Employees’ temperature is checked on a daily basis through non-contact type of thermometers ‘Aarogya-Setu’, a mobile app developed by the Government of India, is installed in the mobile devices of all employees, thereby helping them check the status of COVID-19 on a daily basis. 
Social distancing is practiced at all our workplaces, with flexible work hours. Some employees are allowed to work from home, based on their nature of work.
Sanitisers are being kept at all the important locations. 
Use of masks has been made mandatory for everyone. 
Immunity booster medicines are served to all the employees free of cost. 
Nurturing the future workforce. 
We believe in developing in-house talent, and hence, we lay emphasis on talent development through various learning initiatives and identifying the competency gaps.
We also hire trainees from India’s leading engineering colleges and National Power Technology Institute. We run a specific induction training program called ‘Campus to Corporate’, which is a month-long programme covering various aspects of power plant operations. During this programme, trainees are exposed to theoretical concepts and are imparted insights on subject matter from power plant experts, knowledge of all core and service functions and their role in the organization.
Besides theoretical concepts, trainees also learn from practical exposure and plant visits. This helps in learning all the concepts and their application in the plants, thereby making them conversant with technology and equipment. Along with technical training, behavioural training is also imparted related to workplace communication, teamwork, positive attitude and accountability.
Employee Well-being and Retention. 
At APL, the overall well-being of employees is closely related to the work-life balance opportunities provided to them. It also depends on the tangible and intangible support they get from the organization to pursue personal and professional goals.
As a modern and dynamic workplace, we provide several flexible solutions, including smart working and remote working solutions, whenever possible.

Constant suggestions on career development and means to improve performance enable our workforce to perform with greater efficiency. During the reporting year, 91.5% of the employees were eligible for performance appraisal, of which the process was completed for 100%.
Employee Engagement. 
We carried out a detailed employee engagement survey with a third party – the Gallup Survey. The survey results have shown interesting aspects of our employees’ perception and motivation levels. The bi-annual survey, Gallup’s Q12, assesses the engagement level of all the employees in an effective way. The methodology is based on twelve questions designed around the below key questions:
What do I get?
What do I give?
Do I belong?
How can we grow?
The scores achieved are then compared with Gallup’s database scores in India and globally.
Employee engagement score. 
A total of 93% of the employees responded to the survey, which will be done once in two years. For Adani Power Limited, the Grand Mean Score stood at 3.87/5, representing a higher level of engagement with the Company.
There is no unionized workforce, and hence, there are no collective bargaining agreements. However, there are multiple ways through which we ensure management and workforce interactions.
There are specific schemes for reaching out to the employees at the operation sites. The HR personnel visit shop-floors at regular intervals and listen to employees’ grievances pertaining to provident funds, mediclaim, and attendance records, among others. Efforts are taken to resolve every issue within 48 hours.
During townhall meetings, the senior management at every plant location addresses all the employees collectively. These meetings encourage employee suggestions, queries, best-practice sharing and ideation. Some of these issues are addressed at the meetings, and for others, follow-up actions are undertaken based on the requirement.

Response to Covid-19 Pandemic. 
The company’s Risk Management Committee identified risk of Covid-19 and its potential impacts early and made necessary arrangements for the unhindered continuity of operations. This required formation of Covid-19 Task Force at each plant and the Head Office, arrangements for temperature screening of employees and contractors, hand sanitizations, advisory and provision of masks, social distancing, quarantine rules and arrangements for travelers and work from home schedule etc. Continuous communication to employees, contract workers through the emails, posters and banners, standing instructions helped create good awareness and ensured cooperation from all involved.
During the lockdown, special arrangements were made for the logistics of manpower, raw materials and in few cases, stay arrangements of employees was made on the sites. Similarly, for the smooth functioning of some suppliers and manpower contractors / agencies, advance payments were made for retaining the workers, where essential. Beyond the operations, all the plants in their capacity, also helped nearby communities to cope with the pandemic by distribution of masks, sanitisers and food packets.
During the COVID-19 lockdown, the Company stood by all its commitments, as a matter of duty to the nation, and ensured maximum availability of its capacity to generate power, so that the supply of power to the consumers continues uninterrupted. Further, the company has included pandemics in the Business Continuity Plans and made SOPs for ensuring interrupted operations in case of such events in future.

The process of HIRA, job safety analysis, and the hierarchy of control is covered under our safety management system, as per ISO 45001:2018 standard. Under the safety management system, HIRA and job safety analysis is conducted to identify and eliminate potential risks involved in the working environment.
Moreover, activities carried out on a day-to-day basis are considered under routine activity, for which HIRA is reviewed every three years. HIRA and job safety analysis is conducted when there is a change in operating procedure, change in process and expansion work, occurrence of safety incidents, non-routine activity and any observations in HIRA made by internal and external auditors.
The effectiveness of HIRA and Job Safety Analysis is ensured by engaging crossfunctional teams. It also includes the involvement of workers engaged in the activity, which eliminate the obstacles of effective implementation of the same.
We have set up a robust Incident Investigation process under the Safety Management System to investigate any safety-related incident. Any such incident will be followed by an immediate incident investigation carried out by a crossfunctional team. These teams adopt techniques such as interviewing, incident site evaluation, and root cause analysis to identify the root cause and propose suitable corrective actions.
Encouraging a safe and healthy workplace is paramount to our business. We have a proactive approach towards capturing workrelated hazards and hazardous situations such as routine Gemba walk and scheduled safety observation sessions. We also encourage our direct and indirect works to report any work-related hazard, hazardous situation, and concerns through reporting managers, suggestion boxes or workers representative in safety committees. We ensure prevention against retaliation towards works, rights to workers to refuse or stop unsafe or unhealthy work through our Whistle Blower policy, Human Rights policy, and grievance handling mechanism.
As a part of ISO 14001 and ISO 45001, a plant specific disaster management plan is available at all the operating locations.
Project Chetna A safety culture transformation journey. 
We have set forth on the safety cultural transformation journey titled ‘Project Chetna’, in consultation with M/s DuPont, a pioneer organization in the field of safety management. Proper identification and a thorough assessment of prevalent practices precedes the implementation of further improvement techniques. Hence, Phase-I of ‘Project Chetna’ comprized an ‘as-is-analysis’ and quick-win opportunity identification through DuPont’s dynamic assessment.
With the implementation of this project, the responsibility for health and safety issues become firmly established as an integral part of the line management function. All levels of line management possess a much greater knowledge of how to develop and implement high quality safety management systems.
Phase-II of the project is more focused on systematic deployment of Safety Interaction, Incident Management, Contractor Safety Management, Process Safety Management and High Risk Activities. It involves developing a governance structure that integrates business processes to include safety risk management.
After the completion of both the phases, we are driving our own initiatives for building a culture of safety and bring about behavioural change. These initiatives include a one-onone interaction of shop-floor workers with our senior management. We have developed a comprehensive process for incident management and a detailed Contract Safety Management. This includes interaction of crossfunctional teams. Contract awards are based on due diligence of safety standards, discussion on safety mandates, compliance monitoring and a detailed contract closure audit.
The key initiatives undertaken during FY2019-20 include:
Life Saving Safety Rules training and undertaking covering all our employees 100% implementation of Gensuite, an online Safety Management Platform. 
Initiatives for Felt Leadership undertaken through message from CEO, Steering Committee Meeting and location-wise Town Hall meets.

Responsible Supply Chain Management. 
Inclusive growth and sustainable development form the core of our corporate responsibility philosophy. At APL, we undertake all measures to ensure that our value chain partners uphold the highest standards of social and environmental responsibility.
APL has a systematic vendor selection process, knowledge-sharing initiatives and constant interactions with our vendor base for performance review and feedback on quality.
Engagement with Vendors. 
Our detailed vendor selection process includes certain basic screening criteria. Among the other quality, safety and pricing criteria, we assess the environmental and social responsibilities fulfilled by our vendors.
We encourage that our vendors follow recognized management systems and standards such as the ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001. Moreover, as a part of our Human Rights Policy, we ensure that our vendor partners protect and upkeep the human rights of their employees.
Also, as part of our efforts to bring about economic development and create employment opportunities locally, we encourage vendor selection from domestic market.
In FY 2019-20, for non-fuel supplier, we had a base of 5847 vendors (based on last 3 year transactions)** . Nearly 98.2% of these Vendors are local (i.e. Domestic). Out of total service and material contract value for FY 19-20, 94.8% of the value was awarded to local (i.e. Domestic) vendors.
** except – fuel procurement vendors, which include traders and logistics partners. 
As a part of the vendor registration process, all the suppliers are assessed on various parameters including quality, safety, environment and social impact at the time of onboarding. To leverage synergy across the group companies, we have developed a common vendor base across all the Group companies.
To build a sustainable business relationship with our vendors, we measure the performance of the vendor and provide regular and transparent feedback for their improvement and development.
New suppliers that were screened using environmental and social criteria = 100% (for critical suppliers)
Based on our vendor assessments, there were no negative environmental and social impacts identified for critical suppliers.
We consider our vendors as business partners and extend our support for their growth and sustainability. We have shown our commitment towards well being of Employees of Contractors who are working at our site during challenging COVID-19 period. We have made additional payment for 6 months (from 25/03/2020 to 30/09/2020) towards those Contract workers who were advised not to attend duty for maintaining minimum possible workforce at plant or who were not able to resume duty due to leave, sickness or stuck at other places because of lockdown. Even this practice is continue beyond 30.09.2020 at our sites on case to case basis for maintaining workplace hygiene and safety of contractor workman.
Customer satisfaction. 
Adani Power has adopted ISO Management System (IMS) to improve its overall performance and consistently provide products/services that meet customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. Under this system, organisation is required to effectively communicate with its customers regarding its products/services, handling enquiries and obtaining customer feedback relating to its products/services. During 2019-20, there were no major unresolved grievances from the customers.
During this reporting year, there have been two acquired operations – REL and REGL. Due to these acquisitions, our supply chain has expanded and their existing suppliers have become a part of our vendor base.
Our systematic vendor selection process, knowledge-sharing initiatives and constant interactions with our vendor-base for performance review and feedback on quality form the basis of our supply chain initiatives.
Stages of our procurement practice. 
Step 1: Vendor identification and onboarding. 
The vendor on-boarding process broadly covers four aspects: identification, prescreening, pre-qualification and approval. Successful vendors during the tendering process are transferred into the Vendor Master list. A vendor code is generated for new vendors, following which the Category Lead begins formulating the contract.
Step 2: Vendor performance management. 
Performance of Vendors who delivers goods are evaluated based on following criteria: 1. Quality of product 2. Delivery adherence 3. Price competitiveness. 
Performance of Vendors who delivers services at our site are evaluated based on following criteria: 1. Quality of services 2. Delivery adherence and site management system 3. Price competitiveness 4. Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) aspects. 
Our value chain. 
Our businesses benefit from the competitiveness and scale of our suppliers. The value integration of coal, port and power together provide the most desired synergy. This synergy helps us in quick turnaround of our projects and delivers the best value to all our stakeholders.

Mr. Upendra Varmora Vice President- Energy Contracts Management Group. 
As a responsible corporate citizen, we believe in co-creating value along with our suppliers. To streamline our vendor selection, management and retention processes, we have categorized our vendors based on criticality. We have also developed a digital platform for vendor management. With these initiatives, we want to ensure that we build seamless transactions with vendor partners and create lasting relationships.
Since our inception, we have worked persistently to create a mechanism to ensure effective utilization of the ash which is a non-hazardous solid waste arising from coal-based power generation being generated at our power plants based on site-specific strategies. Through our various initiatives such as developing wagon loading infrastructure, installing HCSD systems, Bagging & Classification systems, development of M-sand unit and promoting entrepreneurs involved in ash-based product development, we have continuously strived to develop innovative avenues and maximize the utilization of ash sustainably as per the regulatory guidelines.
Approach to suppliers - ESG aspects. 
Plant-wise fuel supply information is available on the Company’s website – Investor Presentation.
Customer health and safety. 
As we are in the business of thermal power generation, where our customers are the distribution companies, we do not have any products or services that pose health and safety risks to the customer. However, as part of our CSR programmes, we work with electricians and workmen on various safety practices with regard to handling of electrical equipment.

Community Engagement and Development. 
As a responsible corporate citizen, we have always adopted a model of inclusive growth and have been actively involved in the upliftment of the marginalized communities that we operate in through the Adani Foundation. The Foundation has an illustrious body of work spanning over two decades. The expanse of the Foundation’s activities is not limited to the areas where the Group’s operations are prevalent, but also covers other geographies that require developmental intervention.
The Foundation specifically focuses on women empowerment, children, differently-abled people, socially marginalized communities, tribal communities, fisher folk and farmers. It enables this by facilitating quality education, enabling the youth with income-generating skills, promoting a healthy society, and supporting infrastructure development.
GRI 413-2. 
Our projects may entail land use changes that may impact the lives of people in the vicinity of the operations, and also at operational stage. However, there may be resources like water which is shared with communities in the same watershed. There are a plethora of CSR programmes aimed at creating positive impacts on the communities in the nearby areas.
We believe that we too derive environmental, social and business value from each of these interventions. On the other hand, maintaining a relationship based on trust and harmonious co-existence are the direct results of our community programmes. There are multiple ways in which our business derives indirect value. This can be in the form of creating future talent pool through skill development programmes or improving the economy in the region we serve.
Moreover, there are long-term positive impacts of programmes meant at water conservation which help in the overall watershed management and reduce water stress in the regions we operate in. Several other programmes on infrastructure, health and cultural heritage preservation are helpful in the overall development of the region where we operate in.
Our approach to CSR programmes is ttwopronged. There are a set of key programmes run across all our locations. Designed by the Adani Foundation, these programmes address the key priority areas identified by the business:
Primary Education. 
Community Health. 
Sustainable Livelihood Development. 
Rural Infrastructure Development. 
With the ever-transforming landscape of conventional thermal power, stakeholder engagement and constant monitoring of their concerns is the key to create timely responses specific to their concerns. Our engagement with communities begins from the project planning stage, and continues when the plants become operational. We ensure that the CSR programmes being designed become selfsustainable.
For all our operations, we engage with the local communities from the project stage. We carry out detailed environmental and social impact assessment, and develop programmes that help address the identified issues.

Outreach and Impact. 
Adani Foundation began its water conservation activities in Tiroda in 2012. In this region, which is known as the rice bowl of India, low rainfall adversely affected paddy crop. The focus of water conservation activities here was to identify the irrigation system already existing (check dams/Malgujari tanks /percolation tanks/streams) rather than creating new infrastructure and also to create participatory irrigation management co-operative societies. The impact multiplied as water storage capacity under the initiative touched 10,71,520 CUM, benefiting 4,588 families, surrounding cattle and wildlife covering more than 11,494 acres of land.
In Godda, total deepening work of 68 ponds has been completed till date, increasing the water storage capacity by 494,713 CUM, across 3,061 acres benefiting 6,542 farmers.
In Udupi, five community RO plants were installed in the villages of Yellur, Mudarangadi, Tenka (R&R colony), Bada and Belapu. With a capacity of purifying 1,000 litres of water per hour and storage capacity of 5,000 litres of purified water per unit, this facility aimed to reduce water borne diseases in these regions. Villagers were also provided 12 litre water cans for carrying this potable drinking water – a total of 6,148 persons benefited from this initiative.
Outreach and Impact. 
In Puri area, electricity was restored by employee volunteers.
At Sangli, interventions were made in more than 25 villages, impacting ~2,000 families and more than 5,000 lives.
Key Projects. 
Need-based infrastructure support is given to villages in Tiroda, Godda, Kawai and Raipur, including construction and renovation of toilets, classrooms, libraries and laboratories in Anganwadis, schools and colleges. Construction and renovation of road connected to village, community halls and other public utility services are also facilitated by Adani Foundation.
Water Conservation. 
Rooftop rainwater harvesting, pond deepening, recharging bore-wells are affordable, easily implementable and highly replicable techniques for collection and storage of rainwater at surface or in sub-surface aquifer, before it is lost as run-off. While building check dams in a developing country like India is indispensable, the above mentioned methods of water conservation and management help in reducing the overall cost and the demand of treated water. These solutions have yielded a sustainable increase in groundwater levels and availability of water for consumption as well as irrigation.
Cyclone FANI caused large scale devastation in 14 districts in Odisha in 2019, Puri, Cuttack, Kendrapara and Jagatsinpur were severely affected. Community infrastructure was a matter of grave concern as the electricity structures were devastated and uprooted. Considering the severity of the destruction, Adani Foundation teams in Tiroda, with support from APML Employee Volunteers, worked towards restoration of electricity in Puri. The activities included erection of electric poles and stringing work; provision of GI metal sheet and required accessories, temporary housing facilities for affected communities.
During the Sangli floods in August, as heavy rain battered western Maharashtra, nearly 250 villages in Kolhapur and Sangli were flooded and cut off from the rest of the districts.
Adani Foundation provided medical aid, and facilitated bulb distribution, electrification of villages and public place sanitation. A total of 36 APML Disaster Relief teams and MHCU teams were appointed in Sangli for 10 days. A total of 360 person-days were spent by the 36 employees.

Other Projects. 
In addition to these priority areas, there are a plethora of initiatives undertaken based on the requirements of local communities and the findings of the frequent engagement.
Key projects across all locations include: • Swachhagraha • Saksham • Suposhan • Udaan. 
Swachhagraha. 
Swachhagraha draws inspiration from the largest and most effective mass movement that our nation has seen – that of ‘Satyagraha’ – to give rise to a sustainable culture of cleanliness. It seeks to take the country’s Swaccha Bharat Abhiyaan a step further by encouraging active participation of young citizens and creating youth leaders. It provides these leaders a platform to not only take action, but also inspire others in the society.
Saksham. 
More than 1,500 women in the aspirational district of Godda, Jharkhand, have been trained in stitching and tailoring through the Adani Skill Development Centre. These women have come together under the umbrella of a self-help group (SHG) called Phoolo Jhano Saksham Aajeevika Sakhi Mandal (PJSASM).
Adani Foundation, with support from the district administration of Godda, has set up mega garment production hubs where women are involved in stitching various items such as school uniforms, bags and sweaters. These women have collectively earned over ` 1.86 crore in FY 2018-19 and FY 2019-20 through this initiative by stitching of over 305,578 pairs of School Uniforms.
The district administration has entrusted faith on the group for supply of sweaters for 1.50 lakh school students. A sum of ` 50 lakh was sanctioned for the sweater-making project which is taking place at the Sunderpahari Centre. Similarly, Adani Skill Development Centre runs another tailoring production centre with 15 advanced sewing machines at Raipur, Chhattisgarh. Here, a group of 15 women of Saheli Shashakt Silai Samooh and 10 female trainees are engaged in sewing various kinds of bags, pants, shirts and blouses. The group has earned ` 2.35 lakh between October 2019 and March 2020.
SuPoshan. 
Adani Foundation’s SuPoshan project is an initiative by Adani Wilmar, implemented by the Adani Foundation. It targets to alleviate malnutrition and anaemia among children in 0-5 years of age, adolescent girls, pregnant women, lactating mothers and women in the reproductive age. This way, it supports the Ministry of Women and Child Development’s Poshan Abhiyaan. This is facilitated by a communitybased model – a SuPoshan Sangini. This is a village health volunteer who plays a pivotal role in spreading awareness, referrals and promoting behavioural change among the target groups to achieve the project objectives.
Till date, 634 SuPoshan Sanginis have been working in 1,369 villages and municipal wards across the country and providing services to 324,064 households. Thus, Fortune SuPoshan has been able to bind the Adani Foundation’s three core areas of work – namely education, health and sustainable livelihood development into one.
Udaan. 
Since 2010, more than 3.48 lakh students/participants have had the opportunity to participate in Project Udaan. Here, students are given a chance to see and experience the operations of the Adani Group businesses, including Port, Power and Edible Oil refining facilities. These activities are supervized in five states across six locations at Mundra and Hazira (Gujarat), Kawai (Rajasthan), Tiroda (Maharashtra), Dhamra (Odisha) and Udupi (Karnataka). The exercise stimulates young minds to dream big and inspires them to become entrepreneurs, innovators and achievers of tomorrow.
There are no significant actual or potential negative impacts on local communities as a result of our operations.

The Board of Directors takes responsibility for the implementation of corporate governance practices with appropriate checks and balances. The Company complies with the necessary requirements of Corporate Governance under Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement with the Stock Exchanges. The Board reviews compliance with all the applicable laws to the Company as required under Regulation 17(3) of the SEBI Listing Regulations.
Moreover, the Company has established systems for internal control and audit. Some of the key features of the internal control mechanisms include:
Adequate documentation of policies, guidelines, authorities and approval procedures such as Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and Delegation of Authority (DOA) are in place for controlling important functions. 
Monitoring of all laws, regulation and statutory compliances is being done through an internal online portal. 
Audit Committee, comprising Independent Directors, regularly reviews the adequacy of internal controls and ensures compliance with Accounting Standards, among others. 
A comprehensive Information Security Policy and continuous updating of IT systems. 
Anti-Corruption. 
APL intends to pursue its commitment to fight corruption in all its forms – whether direct or indirect. We consider corruption posing a significant risk to regulatory compliance and public image. Hence, as part of our enterprisewide risk assessment, we constantly monitor any activity that may lead to corruption-related risks. Training of code of conduct is the part of this induction.
APL complies with the main relevant legislation and all the best corporate governance practices, as applicable. All our Board Members, senior executives and employees are made aware of the Code of Conduct (CoC). These members are also required to sign the CoC annually, as a part of the Annual Compliance Report.
Our vendor partners are also made aware of the Code before awarding of any contract to them.
Moreover, the Code of Conduct specifically focuses on the following areas, where there is a relatively higher probability of corruption.
We are vigilant of these areas with potential exposure to corruption, which includes: (i) negotiation and execution of contracts with third parties (ii) participation in tenders; (iii) selection of vendor partners/consultants (iv) management of financial resources; (v) gifting and hospitality; (vi) recruitment processes; (vii) and, incentives for top management.
During the reporting year, we did not make any political donations or contributions. As a policy, any political donation, irrespective of the amount, requires approval -from the Board of Directors.
The business of power generation in India is a licensed one and the annual revenues are governed by contracts. Thus, competition doesn’t affect revenues over the concession period once the project is awarded and service agreements are signed. Projects at the central level are predominantly awarded under Tariff Based Competitive Bidding and are open to all the eligible companies to participate. The process of the award is fair and transparent. Moreover, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) acts as a watch-dog in identifying and curbing any anti-competitive practices.
We are aware of our role as a significant player in India’s power generation industry. Hence, we ensure that we are not involved in any sort of ‘anti-competitive’ behaviour, ‘anti-trust’ or monopoly, which may have legal implications. We do not have any legal actions or litigations against us regarding the same during the reporting period.
We have implemented Legatrix, an IT-enabled legal support service relating to legal and regulatory compliances. We are in line with all the regulatory compliance and endeavour to maintain the objective of zero noncompliance status.

Enterprise Risk Management framework.

Station Risk Committee Project / Operational Sites. 
Functional Risk Committee. 
At APL, we have a structured process to identify the potential threats and risks. The strategy to manage these risks and the mechanisms to monitor the strategy is also taken care of by the risk management process.
Some of these broad risk categories are:
The risk management process is overseen by the Risk Management Committee at the Board level and at the business level, the business risk management committee. The Chief Risk Officer is responsible for overseeing the entire process and there are different committees for different sites and functions.
Key Risks. 
Based on the nature and severity of all the risks, the key risks are identified, assessed and mitigation measures are strategized.
GRI 102-15. 
Financial Risk These risks pertain to reduced accessibility to funds, increase in cost of funding or the ability to provide adequate returns. These may arise out of inappropriate fund allocation and may, in some cases, even lead to credit risk, litigation and loss of reputation.
Mitigation: We ensure that we have a well distributed capital structure which helps us cope with the market exigencies.
People Risk This risk can impact the firm’s ability to attract appropriate talent as well as in suboptimal utilization of the existing resources. These are also related to productivity and attrition of available manpower and can have a direct impact on innovation and leadership within the firm. Typical risks include poaching of employees by competitors, slowing career growth, inadequate training, lack of communication with higher management, and low employee productivity, among others.
Mitigation: Ensuring people’s career growth, maintaining health & safety standards, adopting best practices in managing human resources are some of the measures we adopt in order to mitigate people-related risks. We define a clear growth path for each and every employee; and talent supersedes all other considerations as we believe in providing equal opportunities to each of them.
Regulatory Risk. 
These are risks related to adverse developments in the regulatory environment that may negatively impact processes and lead to losses in revenue, fuel security and other business opportunities. Given the highly regulated nature of the power business, assessing and managing regulatory risks is critical. Any adverse development in this can lead to huge fines, plant shutdown and loss of public image. Change in governments, policies or laws and regulations may directly or indirectly impact business.
Mitigation: We have a defined compliance monitoring system which helps us keep ourselves updated on regulations. The legal team ensures that all the other functions are complying with these regulations. Moreover, being an industry leader, we take active part in liaisoning with the regulatory authorities and participating in advocacy activities.
Operational Risk. 
These arise mostly due to the lapses in processes set up internally in the organization. These are risks pertaining to business operations such as compliance to O&M practices, supply chain management as well as risks associated with nonavailability of plant due to forced shutdowns or project delays. They serve as a check to ensure uninterrupted working of plants.
Mitigation: Robust implementation of management standards, constant focus on business excellence as well as corrective measures driven by innovative practices optimises efficiency and productivity and mitigates any operational risk.
Business and Commercial Risks. 
These are risks related to business set-up and the ongoing commercial risks such as market volatility, emergence of new business models, lack of long-term fuel security, infrastructural requirements, and volatility in demand, among others.
Mitigation: In order to monitor any upcoming changes in the operating environment, the respective functions are on constant lookout for such risks. And alternative measures in terms of looking for new sources of raw materials, development of new markets, and safeguards against demand volatility are all taken care of.
Risk management follows a structured process of:
Risk identification. 
A comprehensive risk register is formed with the most likely risks for a power business. Along with this, a list of lead and lag indicators are identified. The qualitative and quantitative thresholds are identified, and these trigger the consequent risk assessment and mitigation process.
Risk assessment and prioritization. 
Based on the severity of the identified risks, they are assessed and prioritized.
Risk mitigation. 
For each of the prioritized risks, comprehensive risk mitigation strategies are defined and documented in the risk register.


ESG Report 2019-20. 
Growth with Goodness 96 97. 
Security Risk This risk relates to three main dimensions – assets, employees and intellectual capital. All these dimensions are equally important and need to be handled with equal rigour. Safety violations in a power company can often lead to extreme consequences such as loss of life.
Mitigation: In the current changing workplace scenario, we are highly vigilant of data security and related intellectual property. We also remain cautious of safeguarding all our physical and intellectual assets. Safety is the topmost priority of our Company and we have adopted world renowned standards of industrial safety.
Enterprise and Governance Risk. 
These are risks related to enterprise and inter-organizational risks including strategy, decision-making and governance. For a growing organization such as Adani Power Limited, a long-term strategy, its effective implementation and coordination with other group companies is highly critical.
Mitigation: Our Board of Directors function in alignment with the Group’s overall philosophy, which is overseen by the Chairman. We follow the industry’s best practices as far as Corporate Governance is concerned.

Adani Power Limited has been publishing its Sustainability Report since 2015. In FY 2019-20, the Sustainability Report intends to present a concise and comprehensive view of the Company’s Environmental, Social and Governance practices and performance to all its stakeholders. Apart from presenting the sustainability context, strategy, material topics and stakeholder engagement mechanisms, the Report’s content has been grouped into these three broad sections of Environment, Social and Governance for better understanding of the readers.
How has the document been developed?
The Report has been prepared according to GRI Standards in accordance Comprehensive option and content formulation process has been based on the principles of relevance (“materiality”), stakeholder inclusivity, sustainability context and completeness of data and information. The content is also aligned to disclosure requirements of investor bodies such as CDP, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index as well as FTSE 4 Good index. The key objectives of our sustainability strategy have also been mapped to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, which we are contributing to by working towards these objectives. The climate related disclosures are in line with the principles of TCFD. The report content is also formulated considering the International <Integrated Reporting> Framework.
Materiality and Inclusivity. 
The principle of materiality is key to developing the Report’s content. The material topics, their relevance and the boundaries have all been defined in the ‘ESG Priorities’ section of the Report page no. 28. The material issues are being identified and assessed based on the outcomes of stakeholder engagement as well as constant monitoring of external and internal factors that impact the Company’s performance.
Emerging Risks. 
With the current global challenges presented by COVID-19 pandemic, we have re-evaluated our risks and are trying to strengthen our risk management and mitigation system to avert such emerging risks.
The key emerging risks we have identified include:
Emergency preparedness in the face of scenarios such as a pandemic, widespread and longterm climate-related disasters and national emergency. In such scenarios, business continuity itself will be threatened. Hence, we are prepared to take robust safeguards against such risks.
Another key risk area that has the capacity to pose a significant challenge in the coming years is cyber security and data privacy. With the global dynamics changing drastically and with large-scale dependence of many businesses on global data networks, cyber security can pose a significant threat to businesses.

We have provided our observations to the Company in a separate management letter. These, do not, however, affect our conclusions regarding the Report.
As per AA1000 APS 2008 principles: � Principle of Inclusivity: We are not aware of any matter that would lead us to conclude that the Company has not applied principle of inclusivity while engaging with key stakeholder groups. The Report communicates the frequency and the mode of engagement with stakeholders – both internal and external, highlighting the outcomes of interactions and the Company’s response towards the same. The Company may consider engaging with all relevant stakeholders of the recently acquired operational locations and integrate it with the disclosures in the Report.
� Principle of Materiality: The methodology of materiality determination used for the Report takes into consideration the principles of reporting as per GRI Standards. Nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that material topics so identified have been excluded by the Company. The Company reviews its material topics internally.

Nothing has come to our attention that causes us not to believe that the information has been presented fairly, in material respects, in keeping with the reporting principles. APL monitors the sustainability performance data across all its operations mentioned in the boundary of the Report. The monitoring mechanism and its related internal controls may be further strengthened with respect to the sustainability disclosures especially on occupational health and safety and workforce related indicators.
