3 The Coca–Cola Company 2020 Business & ESG Report. 
I’ve long believed that history provides lessons that can apply to life today.
Looking back, The Coca-Cola Company has weathered many difficult times over its 135 years. Each time, we’ve turned adversity into opportunity.
In 2020, we experienced history once again.
Historians of the future will decide how the events of 2020 reshaped the world. I already know this—the year of the pandemic has changed our business and our industry in ways that will endure. We’ve learned much in the last year, and it will help us continue to change for the better.
Today, when I reflect on 2020, one of the words that comes to mind is resilience. Our people and our business were resilient in the face of extraordinary challenges. Our people quickly adapted to new conditions to support our communities and our business.
We also showed great resolve in continuing to pursue goals that did not change—all guided by the purpose of our company: to refresh the world and make a difference.
Environmental, Social & Governance. 
Our environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals are embedded in how we operate as a business—they are part of our very foundation. In 2020, I was commonly asked whether ESG goals would change or take a back seat to other priorities during the crisis. The answer—then and now—is that ESG remains core to what we do.
For example, we continued our World Without Waste efforts in 2020, even in the midst of many temporary disruptions. Across markets representing 30% of our global volume, we offer 100% recycled plastic packaging options in at least one brand. This number grew in 2020, and we’re now offering packages made of 100% recycled PET in around 30 markets.
In 2020, we also developed a goal to reduce our use of virgin PET by a cumulative 3 million metric tons globally by 2025. This is the equivalent of taking out one whole year’s worth of virgin plastic over the next five years. And the Netherlands and Norway became the second and third markets after Sweden to announce that we’ll manufacture entire local portfolios in 100% recycled PET.
Packaging has a close link to climate, and 2020 also saw important progress in defining our goals. The company supports a vision to be net-zero carbon by 2050, and we have set a 2030 science-based target to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 25% as compared to a 2015 baseline.
We’ve been on a journey to drive progress against intersecting priorities like water and building resilient communities. We’ve developed a science-based 2030.

Chairman & CEO Message


4 The Coca–Cola Company 2020 Business & ESG Report water strategy focused on achieving water security where the company operates and sources ingredients. We will maintain 100% replenishment globally, focusing on improving watershed health in water-stressed areas that are critical to the business and that support our agricultural supply chain. Since 2010, our water, sanitation and hygiene programs have also reached more than 13.5 million people globally.
Finally, 2020 marked an exciting milestone in our social impact work. We surpassed our goal of enabling the economic empowerment of 5 million women through our 5by20® program, creating shared value for these women, their families and communities.
Changing to a Networked Organization. 
Our ongoing commitment to ESG goals in 2020 was an example of where we left critical objectives unchanged— indeed, we enhanced them.
In other places, there were vast changes, including in the way we operate our business.
In 2020, we announced plans to build a new, networked organization that combines the power of scale with the deep knowledge required to win in markets locally. Nine operating units were established to focus on regional and local execution, working closely with five marketing category leadership teams that span the globe.
This structure is supported by our new Platform Services organization and center functions, which collectively provide global services and expertise across a range of critical capabilities.
Together, this networked organization will accelerate our transformation as a digitized, data-driven enterprise that can execute marketing, commercial, sales and distribution strategies in both the online and physical worlds.
A Winning Growth Portfolio. 
We are positioning our portfolio for success, identifying the right brands that will drive quality leadership and help us achieve our Beverages for Life vision. In 2020, we streamlined our portfolio to approximately 200 master brands, allowing us to focus attention and resources on what we do best: brand building and innovation.
Great brands begin with a deep understanding of consumers, what they want and converting that insight into superior, quality products. We will continue to grow our brands through focused execution and targeted innovation.
Despite the challenges we faced in 2020, we saw strong performance in key segments of our portfolio, including: • Trademark Coca-Cola returned to growth in the back half of the year, with strong performance from Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, which grew volume 4% for the year.
• As consumers shifted to drinking more beverages at home, we saw Simply and fairlife grow double digits in North America.
• Certain water brands saw strong growth, including AHA and Topo Chico Sparkling Mineral Water.
We also made strides in innovation. For example, we introduced our first touchless Freestyle machines in the United States, which allow consumers to choose and pour drinks from their phones in just a few seconds without the need to create an account or download an app.
We also continued to change the recipes of our beverages and reduce added sugar, along with offering smaller portion sizes. We removed approximately 125,000 tons of added sugar on an annualized basis through approximately 140 product reformulations in 2020. We’re innovating and bringing drinks with additional benefits to market and promoting options with low or no calories.
Finally, we are on a journey to strengthen our marketing efficiency and effectiveness. By improving our processes, eliminating duplication and optimizing spending, we will increase our effectiveness and fuel reinvestment in our brands.
The Extraordinary Actions of 2020. 
Our purpose is to refresh the world and make a difference. This guides us in good times and challenging times. During 2020, the Coca-Cola system focused on helping communities through COVID-19 relief efforts around the world. These donations made by the system, when combined with independent contributions from. 
The Coca-Cola Foundation, total more than $90 million, benefiting more than 25 million people in 118 countries and territories.
But the pandemic wasn’t the only crisis of 2020. Last year, we were again reminded that there’s no place in our world for racism. We have a duty to strive for greater justice and equity within our own company as well as within the communities where we operate. Our pledge is that we will do our part to listen, learn and act. Our company must play a visible and proactive role in creating change.
A diverse and inclusive workplace is both the right thing to do and a strategic business priority. Diversity fosters creativity, innovation and connection to the communities we serve. To that end, we have announced our 2030 aspirations: • To mirror the diversity of the markets we serve.
• In the United States, our ambition is to align our race and ethnicity representation to census data across all job levels.
• For our company to be 50% led by women globally.
In this report, we share data that reflects our company’s current diversity across both race (in the United States) and gender for the general employee population, as well as at the leadership level. We will continue to report this data annually.
Finally, our resilience in 2020 gives me renewed confidence that our best years remain ahead. Thankfully, a good starting point matters. As a system, we went into the crisis in a strong position. We are emerging even stronger.

Our Response to COVID-19


6 The Coca–Cola Company 2020 Business & ESG Report. 
Our Response to COVID-19. 
Throughout our history, The Coca-Cola Company has persevered through turbulent times—emerging stronger from world wars, natural disasters, economic crises and more. As COVID-19 spread in 2020, we mobilized quickly to safeguard the health and well-being of our employees; maintain the continuity and safety of our beverage production and delivery operations; ensure resiliency of our supply chain (including supporting suppliers); assist bottling partners and customers; and support communities. We also pivoted our operations, commercial strategies and innovation priorities to meet fast-changing market dynamics, all while advancing our sustainability goals.
Protecting Our People. 
The safety and health of our people is always a top priority. Around the world, local teams closely followed guidance from health authorities to protect our employees across office, production, distribution and retail facilities. In the early stages of the outbreak, nearly all office-based associates shifted to remote work. Our production and distribution facilities continued to operate with significant safety adjustments, such as expanded cleaning and sanitization routines, reductions in person-to-person interactions and requirements for personal protective equipment (PPE).
Empowering Suppliers. 
To maintain business continuity, our global Procurement team collaborated with bottling partners around the world on contingency planning for our supply chain. We worked with suppliers to adjust volumes to meet shifting consumer demands and manage the logistical challenges of lockdowns and movement restrictions. We also took several actions to help our suppliers through the crisis, including committing to accelerated payment of invoices. $1B in financing and accelerated payment processes offered to suppliers. 
Assisting Customers. 
Coca-Cola teams and bottling partners collaborated with retail and foodservice customers to weather the impact of the crisis and adapt to changing shopper behaviors, helping grocery stores meet elevated demand and supporting restaurants as they switched to takeout and delivery models. Lockdowns triggered a digital buying boom in 2020. To support the surge in e-commerce, we concentrated on package sizes that are fit-for-purpose for online sales; boosted investment in digital promotions; increased in-app visibility with e-delivery grocers; and piloted digitally enabled fulfillment methods to manage orders and deliveries.
Supporting Communities. 
The Coca-Cola Foundation has provided approximately $56 million to support COVID-19 relief efforts in communities around the world. Combined donations made by the Coca-Cola system, including independent donations from the Foundation, total more than $90 million.

Our Response to COVID-19


7 The Coca–Cola Company 2020 Business & ESG Report. 
Pivoting to Produce Needed PPE and Supplies. 
Bottling and concentrate plants in countries including France, Brazil, Ireland, Swaziland and Japan pivoted production to make hand sanitizer for hospitals, clinics and nursing homes. The North America Operating Unit teamed up with supply chain partners and a national network of volunteers to produce and distribute protective face shields to healthcare workers and first responders.
Contactless Innovations. 
Safety and hygiene concerns fueled contactless innovations, including the nationwide rollout of touch-free technology for Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain dispensers in the United States. In Japan, Coke ON mobile app users can make touch-free purchases on 30,000 vending machines in train stations, hospitals and other public areas. Buttons and dispensing slots on the machines were covered with antiviral and antibacterial film.
Using Our Marketing Reach to Promote Awareness. 
Coca-Cola locations around the world— from Singapore to South Africa, Austria to Australia, and Brazil to Belgium—used high-profile marketing assets, such as billboards, trucks, packaging and social media channels, to share messages of solidarity and gratitude to front-line heroes and promote safety tips on behalf of public health authorities and partner organizations.
Access to Clean Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)
During the pandemic, we worked with our nonprofit partners to boost our WASH investments in many countries, including Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia. In Uganda, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa and the Ministry of Health distributed 5,000 hand-washing stations in public, high-risk areas to protect people against the spread of COVID-19.
Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) Delivery. 
An online platform, developed at the initiative of Coca-Cola Argentina, enabled small retailers across Latin America to serve customers safely without having to open their stores. When a shopper places an order via the free Wabi app, the system pings nearby retailers. The first retailer to accept delivers the items to the shopper’s home in 30 minutes or less. Read more.
Supporting Vaccine Rollout in Africa. 
The Coca-Cola Foundation has provided a $2 million grant to Project Last Mile to support the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in Africa in 2021. Project Last Mile is our pioneering partnership to improve the availability of life-saving medicines across Africa by leveraging our system’s distribution network and marketing capabilities. This partnership is a legacy of collaboration between The Coca-Cola Foundation, The Coca-Cola Company, the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), USAID, The Global Fund for HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis, and The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
In North America, we provided $1 million in support to restaurants by giving restaurant delivery vouchers to more than 8,000 employees and purchasing meals from foodservice customers as a thank you to associates working hard during the pandemic to produce our products. In Uzbekistan, we supported small retail stores by producing and installing more than 1,500 protective plastic shields for checkout workers.

Our Response to COVID-19


8 The Coca–Cola Company 2020 Business & ESG Report The Coca–Cola Company 1 Calculated with self-reported and internally validated data.
2 As estimated working with our many external partners and using generally accepted, independently peer-reviewed scientific and technical methods. External assurance of 100% annual replenishment rate. Finished beverages based on global sales volume. Water in production based on total system consumptive use.
More than a decade ago, The Coca-Cola Company set a pioneering goal to replenish the water we use in our drinks and their production. We also set targets to use water more efficiently and to treat all wastewater in our production processes.
In each of the last six years, we met and exceeded our 2020 replenish goal. At the same time, we have continued to improve the efficiency of our water use. We now need only 1.84 liters of water per liter of final product, a 19% improvement compared to 2010. While we are proud of our progress, this is short of our goal due to changes in our product and packaging portfolio. For example, producing more diverse product ranges and smaller or refillable packages requires more frequent cleaning and rinsing, which limits the water efficiency in bottling production. In addition, the pandemic reduced production volumes in 2020, reducing the overall efficiency of production lines.

Our New Water Strategy. 
Our new 2030 water strategy recognizes the urgency of our growing shared water challenges and the interconnection of water and other priority goals. Our vision is to increase water security where we operate, source ingredients and touch people’s lives by improving water availability, quality, access and governance.
Sugar reduction remains a top priority. As we continue to evolve as a total beverage company and respond to consumers’ desires for more choices across categories, we are reducing added sugar while providing more drinks with nutrition benefits; optimizing our mix of products; offering smaller package choices; and providing consumers with clear nutrition information.
We offer a wide range of beverages— including sparkling soft drinks, water, coffee, tea, dairy, juices, sports drinks and plant-based options. We track the results of our sugar reduction efforts, the majority of which stem from changes to our sparkling beverage recipes and packaging size reductions.
READ MORE: Our Portfolio/Reducing Added Sugar. 
Our publicly reported sustainability goals drive us to continually improve, working in concert with The Coca-Cola Company’s approximately 225 bottling partners in more than 200 countries and territories.
Having passed the milestone of our 2020 goals, we are working toward new, more ambitious plans, including our 2025 packaging goals, our 2030 climate goal and our new 2030 water strategy.

Our Priorities & Progress


9 The Coca–Cola Company 2020 Business & ESG Report. 
Climate change is a priority issue for our business, and as a global company, we have a long-standing strategy to reduce our carbon footprint. We approach this challenge by reducing the impact we have on climate change; by identifying the risks a changing climate have on our company; and by collaborating with key stakeholders to amplify our actions.
Our climate strategy supports our sustainable agriculture, water and World Without Waste strategies. And our approach to climate governance responds to increased interest from investors and other stakeholders to provide disclosures aligned with the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD).
Having achieved our “drink in your hand” goal to reduce relative carbon emissions by 25% by 2020, against a 2010 baseline, we are now working toward our 2030 Science-Based Target to reduce absolute GHG emissions 25% by 2030. Our ambition is to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
Goals • Reduce absolute GHG emissions 25% by 2030 • Ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Climate. 
A sustainable and resilient agricultural supply chain has never been more critical to our interrelated goals, especially around climate, water, human rights and enabling women’s empowerment. Since 2013, our goal has been to more sustainably source our priority agricultural ingredients, including our main natural sweeteners, fruit juices, coffee, tea, soy and timber products.
In 2020, we faced many challenges. COVID-19 impacted the ability of our suppliers to arrange on-farm assessments, as well as our ability to meet with suppliers and farmers. While this had an impact on our performance in cane sugar and corn, we continued to make progress across most of our other priority ingredients.
While we’re proud of the progress made toward our ambitious 2020 goal, we recognize that we have to push forward with our integrated approach to ensuring sustainable practices across our agricultural supply chain.

Sustainable Agriculture 1 Only recyclable where infrastructure exists.
2 This result is preliminary and final numbers will be reported in the 2020 World Without Waste report.
3 The calculation of progress toward our “drink in your hand” goal has been internally vetted using accepted and relevant scientific and technical methodologies, which are aligned with GHG Protocol Scopes 1, 2 and 3. Due to the nature of our franchise bottling system, our manufacturing emissions are normally split between Scopes 1 and 2 for company-owned facilities and Scope 3 for bottling partner facilities. However, in our “drink in your hand” calculations, we consider the full Coca-Cola system (including franchise bottling partners) in the calculation of our manufacturing, distribution and refrigeration emissions, in addition to the emissions from our ingredients and packaging.
4 Data is based on supplier reporting according to our assurance requirements, which is consolidated and internally validated. Results can fluctuate due to changes in volumes and sourcing origins while we get new suppliers on board with our requirements.
World Without Waste. 
We have a responsibility to help solve the global packaging waste crisis. That’s why, in 2018, we launched an ambitious sustainable packaging initiative called World Without Waste. Three years into this journey, the global conversation about plastic pollution— and calls for urgent, collaborative action—are intensifying. We continued to make progress in 2020, despite the challenges from the pandemic.
New Virgin Plastic. 
Reduction Goal. 
We have set a new goal to reduce our use of virgin plastic derived from non-renewable sources by a cumulative 3 million metric tons over the next five years. In 2025, depending on business growth, we project that we will use approximately 20% less virgin plastic than we do today.

In 2003, we set a goal that 98% of our company locations and system bottlers and 95% of our direct and authorized suppliers will validate compliance with our Human Rights Policy and our Supplier Guiding Principles (SGPs) by the end of 2020. The global pandemic, however, interrupted our in-person audit capabilities, leading to a decrease in compliance percentages for 2020 and forcing us to push the goal date to the end of 2021.

Enabling Women Giving Back. 
In 2010, we announced a global initiative to enable the economic empowerment of 5 million women entrepreneurs by the end of 2020. This initiative, known as 5by20®, set out to address structural inequalities and economic barriers that women entrepreneurs face by providing business skills training, mentoring networks, financial services and other assets to support women and their businesses.
In 2013, we expanded the scope of 5by20 to allow for independent contributions by The Coca-Cola Foundation and other partners.
By the end of 2020, we surpassed our goal, enabling the economic empowerment of more than 6 million women.

13 The Coca–Cola Company 2020 Business & ESG Report 1 The Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners are collectively known as the Coca-Cola system. The Coca-Cola Company does not own, manage or control most local bottling companies.
The Coca-Cola Company markets, manufactures and sells: • beverage concentrates and syrups • finished beverages (including sparkling soft drinks; nutrition, juice, dairy & plant; hydration, sports, tea & coffee; and emerging categories).
In our concentrate operations, The Coca-Cola Company typically generates net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling partners.
Our bottling partners combine the concentrates and syrups with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the product), to prepare, package, sell and distribute finished beverages.
Our finished product operations consist primarily of company-owned bottling, sales and distribution operations.
We also operate retail outlets through Costa Limited, which has nearly 4,000 coffeehouses in the United Kingdom, China and other markets across Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa. The company’s portfolio also includes a coffee vending business, at-home coffee solutions and a roastery.

16 The Coca–Cola Company 2020 Business & ESG Report. 
Innovating to Become a Total Beverage Company. 
Since its birth at a soda fountain in downtown Atlanta in 1886, The Coca-Cola Company has grown through innovation. The company’s iconic drink went from the fountain into bottles before entering markets around the United States—and, eventually, the world.
More than a century later, we’re still committed to innovation while staying focused on our Beverages for Life ambition to provide drinks for every occasion.
In 2020, we announced plans to reshape our beverage portfolio and transition from 400 master brands to approximately 200—the ones that are best positioned for growth and scale. We’re challenging ourselves to think differently about our brands, identifying the greatest opportunities and prioritizing our investments and resources.
Discontinuing some brands allows us to invest in growing trademarks like Minute Maid and Simply and to put more weight behind promising innovations like AHA flavored sparkling water, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer and Coca-Cola Energy. The portfolio reset also better positions us to nurture local innovations and propel successful regional brands to the global marketplace.
Our innovation teams are focused on creating drinks that fit into our consumers’ lives, including categories such as enhanced hydration and plant-based drinks. And our innovation lens isn’t only focused on beverages—we’re also innovating packaging solutions and finding new ways to deliver our products, such as the Wabi mobile app.

AHA. 
Launched in 2020, our new line of sparkling water comes in eight flavors with no sweeteners, no calories and no sodium. Some of them include a spark of caffeine. The brand also unveiled two new flavors in early 2021: Raspberry + Acai and Mango + Black Tea. In the fast-growing flavored unsweetened sparkling water category in North America, AHA showed strong results in its first year, carving out a market share of about 8% and outperforming competitors.
Costa Coffee Ready-to-Drink. 
Following the successful 2019 launch of Costa Coffee’s ready-to-drink cold coffee in a can in both the UK and Poland, 2020 has seen the category continue to grow. The brand has launched its range into markets including Switzerland, Ireland and Costa’s second biggest market, China.
Within its first year, the ready-to-drink range delivered strong performance. In China, ready-to-drink has helped accelerate the Costa brand by creating opportunities to reach consumers in new coffee occasions— with distribution continuing to expand. In 2021, a strong new product development pipeline will build on the core range currently on offer.
Costa Coffee’s ready-to-drink is made with the brand’s Signature Mocha Italia Blend; a recipe developed by the Costa brothers in 1971 and loved by consumers for the last 50 years. The beans that go into this blend are always Rainforest Alliance certified— whether they are served in a can, bottle, cup or pod.
Coca-Cola® with Coffee. 
Our breakthrough innovation, which sips like a Coke and finishes like a coffee, piloted in Japan in 2018 and is now available in nearly 50 markets worldwide. It also has zero-sugar options and is available in flavors such as vanilla and caramel.
smartwater+
In early 2021, we launched this new line of premium waters with unique ingredients and flavor extracts, such as ginseng and green tea, dandelion and lemon, and ashwagandha (an ancient herb) and tangerine.
“ Our goal is to converge on disruptive innovations that are going to move the needle—not just in the marketplace, but at a scale that’s relevant to The Coca-Cola Company.”

17 The Coca–Cola Company 2020 Business & ESG Report. 
Governance & Management. 
Corporate Governance. 
At The Coca-Cola Company, our sound business principles and practices foster an innovative and collaborative culture, which is committed to ethical behavior, accountability and transparency. The company’s Board of Directors has a number of committees to assist in discharging its duties. These include an Audit Committee, a Talent and Compensation Committee, a Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance, a Finance Committee, a Management Development Committee, an ESG and Public Policy Committee and an Executive Committee. The charter for each committee can be viewed on our website. Information about the company’s corporate governance, including our Code of Business Conduct, Corporate Governance Guidelines, Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, is also on our website. For more information or to contact us, visit our website.
ESG Governance. 
The Board’s ESG and Public Policy Committee assists the Board in overseeing the company’s policies and programs and related risks to the company that concern environmental, social, legislative, regulatory and public policy matters, including progress against the company’s ESG goals. The Committee’s scope includes public issues of significance that may affect the company’s business, our shareowners, the broader stakeholder community or the general public. This entails evaluating and reviewing information pertaining to social, political and environmental trends, with oversight over ESG goals and human rights practices.
The Committee reviews, at least annually, all shareowner proposals, public policy advocacy efforts, political contributions and charitable contributions to ensure alignment with company policy. The Committee reports regularly to the full Board on these matters. The Committee also receives periodic updates on priority ESG issues, including information on actions and progress toward goals. Annually, the Committee conducts a self-evaluation, which it presents to the full Board.
Our Board’s Talent and Compensation Committee oversees human capital management policies and strategies across the company. This senior-level commitment and alignment drives the top-down effect of ensuring company leaders are invested in building accountability.
Our ESG Approach Across the Coca-Cola System. 
We pursue our ESG goals through a concerted effort by The Coca-Cola Company and approximately 225 bottling partners in more than 200 countries and territories. We aim to achieve our ambitious goals to drive system1wide change. We have robust internal processes and an effective internal control environment that facilitate the identification and management of risks and regular communication with the Board, our Chairman and CEO and internal teams such as the Enterprise Risk Management team and Risk Steering Committee. Beyond this, our Stakeholder Engagement function works with business units, bottling partners, NGOs, governments and people in communities all around the world to identify risks and progress toward our goals.
For more about our approach to risk management and priority issues, see Our Priority ESG Issues.
Our Approach to Disclosure. 
We aim to provide stakeholders with complete, transparent and candid information in all our public communications. This is our third annual Business & ESG Report, which combines our financial data and sustainability progress and performance into one publication. We also respond to the CDP climate and water questionnaires and make those disclosures publicly available. For this report, we have updated our priority issues matrix and continued to expand our disclosure, including around public policy, supply chain, and diversity, equity and inclusion. We also provide an index to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.
We recognize that there is a need for standardization across reporting frameworks, and we’re continually evaluating reporting options and listening to stakeholder feedback.
We have a robust reporting process that spans many years. This report is prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, a globally recognized framework, and this is the tenth year that these principles have informed our reporting process. For more information about disclosure in this report, please see the Reporting Frameworks. We also provide an index for the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and Coca-Cola participates in the SASB Advisory Group.
Political Contributions. 
The ESG & Public Policy Committee of our Board of Directors annually reviews and approves our advocacy efforts, including all U.S. political contributions from both Political Action Committee (PAC) funds and, where allowed by applicable law, the company’s general treasury funds. We have always taken a bipartisan approach to political contributions, and we have always evaluated our giving based on our political engagement criteria, which we share publicly. Last year we updated our political giving policy to ensure we are evaluating a broader range of criteria. Following the violent events that unfolded in the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, The Coca-Cola Company and the Coca-Cola Political Action Committee suspended political giving to further review how we best use our resources to promote and advocate for the things we believe in and align with our company’s purpose and values. That review is still under way. Information on our political contributions from the last few years is available on our website.
Read about some of our recent public policy initiatives, particularly around waste reduction and climate change.
The Coca-Cola Company was recognized as a trendsetter in political disclosures and accountability in the 2020 CPAZicklin Index, which is produced annually by the Center for Political Accountability.

18 The Coca–Cola Company 2020 Business & ESG Report. 
Our Priority ESG Issues. 
Focusing on the highest-priority ESG issues for our company, system and stakeholders is a foundational step in how we conduct business and develop our corporate strategy.
It is also foundational to how we evolve and report on our business and our ESG efforts. During 2019, we undertook a thorough review of our priority issues in collaboration with a cross-functional internal team and key external stakeholders. These stakeholders represented deep expertise across a range of issues and sectors, including NGOs, academia, some of our business partners, customers and beyond. We were guided by BSR, a leading sustainability NGO.
In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the increased spotlight on social justice in the United States and around the world in 2020, we reviewed our assessment to determine if any of the priority issues had shifted. Cross-functional teams including our ESG, risk and public policy functions, along with our external partner BSR, evaluated the prior year’s assessment to determine if we should adjust any issue prioritization for current or potential impact to the Coca-Cola system. We leveraged market research and BSR’s expertise to update stakeholder expectations.
As a result, we have adjusted key issues on the matrix to better reflect current priority issues. Those adjusted were: economic downturns and periods of uncertainty; diversity, equity and inclusion; social unrest and rising inequality; greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; and adapting and thriving in a digital environment.
Many issues remained high priorities since our last analysis, but we noted an evolution in stakeholder expectations and potential impacts to our business in these several areas. For example, adapting and thriving in a digital environment rose in importance for stakeholders and also became even more critical to our business, as has been demonstrated by the pandemic impacts. Economic downturns and periods of uncertainty includes events such as recessions and pandemics, and 2020 clearly demonstrated that this was of increasing importance for both stakeholders and the Coca-Cola system.
Meanwhile, the multiple social injustices witnessed globally in 2020 underscored diversity, equity and inclusion’s importance to stakeholders and impact to our business. Social unrest and rising inequality, further exacerbated by COVID-19, also increased in priority on the matrix. Lastly, GHG emissions shifted due to increased expectations from stakeholders and importance in our own operations, as underscored by our risk assessments and climate scenario planning.
Both the 2019 analysis and the 2020 refresh are aligned with our Enterprise Risk Management process. Analyzing our priority issues on a regular basis ensures that we take into consideration the changing social, environmental and economic context as we continue to evolve our business.
1 In our 2019 report, this issue was named “Digital Disruption.” It has been updated to “Adapting and Thriving in the Digital Environment.”

Stakeholder Engagement & Partnerships. 
At The Coca-Cola Company, we believe that companies must play a role in creating the systemic change necessary to achieve a more just and equitable society, a more sustainable economy and a healthier planet.
We also believe that businesses, governments, NGOs and civil society can achieve effective outcomes when working together through meaningful partnerships to drive collective action and build shared opportunities for people and communities around the world.
Multi-stakeholder collaboration is especially critical if we intend to make significant strides toward eliminating plastic waste, reducing carbon emissions, ensuring access to clean water and achieving racial equity. Throughout this report, we seek to demonstrate our ambition and leadership in the industry, using our leverage on the most pressing global challenges that require broad collective action.
If the COVID-19 pandemic has taught us anything, it is that we cannot act alone. The deep vulnerabilities exposed have been a moment of convergence that has highlighted the interconnected nature of our world. It has demonstrated the pressing need for systemic change and created a greater sense of urgency for businesses to move the needle on environmental, social and governance initiatives. The pandemic also further underscored the intersection of The Coca-Cola Company’s own sustainability goals amidst the converging crises of climate change, social inequality and economic uncertainty.
We are committed to engaging proactively with partners and stakeholders in all of the countries in which we operate. The insights and feedback of our key stakeholders inform our sustainability strategy across our goals. Stakeholder feedback is also fundamental to our priorities assessments, which are used to inform sustainability strategy, engagement, reporting and disclosure. When engaging with stakeholders, we apply the principles of transparency, inclusiveness, consistency and accountability to promote positive impact and create a virtuous cycle of collaboration.
We take a similar collaborative, multi-stakeholder approach to our efforts to promote systemic change through public policy.

WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM. 
At the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting in January, our Chairman and CEO and leaders of our sustainability teams met with leaders across government, the private sector and civil society, speaking on the role that corporations can play on critical issues ranging from packaging waste reduction to water scarcity. Following that, as meetings moved to a virtual format, we participated in a range of Forum events including the Virtual Oceans Dialogue.
HUMAN RIGHTS CONFERENCE. 
In October, we hosted (virtually) our 12th annual Business & Human Rights Conference, in partnership with the U.S. Council for International Business, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the International Organization of Employers. Michelle Bachelet, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, presented the keynote address.
UN GLOBAL COMPACT. 
Each year, through the UN Global Compact, we participate in a range of events surrounding the United Nations General Assembly, including ESG-focused panel discussions. This year, it was held virtually in September, and we were pleased to join more than 1,200 CEOs from other companies in over 100 countries to sign the Statement from Business Leaders for Renewed Global Cooperation, supporting the UN mission and inclusive multilateralism.
CERES. 
Also in October, Chairman and CEO James Quincey helped to unveil the Ceres’ Roadmap 2030, a 10-year action plan for sustainable business leadership that aims to stabilize the climate, protect water and natural resources, and build a just and inclusive economy. Quincey called the roadmap “a bold action plan for companies to grow and strengthen their businesses while taking on critical environmental and social issues.”

Water Leadership 13.5M+ people provided access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene since 20101. 
The Coca-Cola system is a global leader in water stewardship, with a legacy of ambition, innovation and partnerships to “Reduce, Recycle and Replenish” the water we use globally. Over the past 10 years, together with our bottling partners, we have set a leading example in shared water management inside and outside our operations. During 2020, we built on this experience and launched a bold new strategy to increase water security for our business, communities and nature.

OUR PROGRESS: WHAT WE ACHIEVED SO FAR 1 www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-risks-report-2020 2 files.wri.org/s3fs-public/achieving-abundance.pdf 3 www.unwater.org/water-facts/water-sanitation-and-hygiene/
WATER RISK IMPACTS. 
In addition to analyzing site-specific water risks in our facilities and agricultural supply chain, we have looked at the potential impacts of water-related risk across the value chain.
Water-related risks. 
Business impacts from water-related risks across the value chain. 
Raw material sourcing and supply chain Operations Markets. 
Physical Risks Power outages, commodity price spikes or supply disruption. 
Water-related expenditure and supply disruptions. 
Restricted production volume and lower sales. 
Regulatory Risks Increased supply chain compliance and cost Reduced water allocation, increased taxes and fees. 
New product standards by customers and consumers. 
Reputational Risks Supplier provision of access to water, sanitation and hygiene. 
Potential competition for water with local communities. 
Water footprint impact of company and brands. 
However, this is still short of our initial efficiency goal due to changes in our product and packaging portfolio. For example, producing more diverse product ranges and smaller or refillable packages requires more frequent cleaning and rinsing, which limits the water efficiency in bottling production. In addition, the pandemic reduced production volumes in 2020, reducing the overall efficiency of production lines.
Understanding Business Water Risks. 
Based on the global water risk assessment we conducted in 2020 using the World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct 3.0 tool, we estimate that 39% of our global system-wide production volume was generated in high or extremely high waterstressed regions. Of the company-owned facilities, 21% of total water withdrawn was made in areas of high or extremely high water stress.
Water scarcity also threatens our agricultural supply chain, with key sourcing regions in North America and Asia experiencing increasing water stress. Our ongoing commitment to water stewardship is essential for long-term business growth. We view water security as a shared responsibility: making sure that when we use water in our business, we also protect water for nature and communities.
We have worked to address these risks with a particular focus on water-scarce regions. For example, in India we have consistently improved our Water Use Ratio (liters of water used to make one liter of beverage) in our operations located in high water stress from 1.77 L in 2015 to 1.61 L in 2020. We also worked with communities and farmers in our supply chain to increase water availability, replenishing more than double the amount of water we use.
The Case for Water Security. 
The United Nations considers access to water a basic human right. Yet the World Economic Forum ranks water crises as a top global risk1, while the World Resources Institute projects a 56% gap between global water supply and demand by 20302. About 2.2 billion people globally lack access to safe drinking water3, and it is expected that the COVID-19 pandemic will make this even worse. These challenges affect our business, our customers and the communities in which we operate and are the impetus for our new, more in-depth water strategy.
Progress in Our Previous Decade of Work on Water. 
More than a decade ago, The Coca-Cola Company set a pioneering goal to replenish the water we use in our drinks and their production. We also set targets to use water more efficiently and to treat all wastewater in our production processes. We replenish our water use through partnership projects worldwide that help conserve, clean, store or make accessible an equivalent amount of water for nature and people.
In each of the last six years, we met and exceeded our replenish goal. At the same time, we have continued to improve the efficiency of our water use. We now need only 1.84 liters of water per liter of final product, a 19% improvement compared to 2010. The cumulative improvement since 2010 has been made through leadership commitment, cultural change and innovative projects within our bottling operations globally.
REPLENISH TREATMENT ~100% wastewater treatment compliance >100% replenishment since 2015.

Our 2030 Water Strategy. 
During 2020, we finalized our new water strategy, which was based on our robust water risk assessment and the integration of feedback gathered systematically from our bottlers and partners and through stakeholder engagement with NGOs, governments and other leading companies.
The 2030 water strategy recognizes the urgency of our growing shared water challenges and the interconnection of water and other priority goals (read more in Water Runs Through It: Connecting Our Key Issues). It identifies our vision, desired outcomes and priority levers for change. It also set targets and spells out key actions to be taken throughout our system to achieve the targets (see graphic below). Read more about our strategy on our website.
Our Approach. 
The 2030 strategy acknowledges that water challenges—whether water stress, poor quality or lack of access— are fundamentally local in nature. Specific water targets and interventions must be born of a deep understanding of the local context.
Globally, we remain committed to providing leadership on water through ambitious water stewardship, including robust water risk management, continuous efficiency improvement, wastewater treatment and 100% replenishment, but we are shifting our focus toward making a greater impact on people and ecosystems where it matters most.
Innovation for Water Security. 
We are prioritizing our efforts based on deep-dive analyses of water risks at our facilities and the locations where we source our ingredients. These analyses identify “leadership locations” and “priority watersheds” to address particular water risks and drive innovation for water security where we operate and source ingredients.
Important new and innovative goals for 2030 include: • Regenerative Water Use: New, integrated circular water use in our operations (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Replenish) • Community Resilience: Inclusion of community climate adaptation, in addition to access to water and sanitation, and focus on women and girls • Watershed Health: New framework to address shared water challenges (quantity, quality, ecosystems, infrastructure, governance) • Agriculture: Expansion of scope to water in agriculture, with a focus on stressed sourcing regions.

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY ENTERPRISE WATER FOOTPRINT. 
During 2020, we completed an enterprise water footprint that showed that 93% of our system’s total blue water footprint is in the supply chain—with the largest part attributed to growing the ingredients needed for our products.
WATER RUNS THROUGH IT: CONNECTING OUR KEY ISSUES. 
Our 2030 water strategy is built on a recognition that water risks and opportunities intertwine with many of the key issues for our company, customers and communities now and in the future. For example, climate change is increasing water stresses, so building climate resilience into our water strategy helps us to address business risks and to harness investment opportunities and solutions, especially using nature-based solutions. Agriculture depends on water and is critical to managing our carbon emissions. Our new Principles for Sustainable Agriculture and our new 2030 Water-Ag roadmap will highlight the opportunities for progress on sustainable agriculture, climate and water. Our work on access to clean water and sanitation provides multiple quantifiable benefits for women’s empowerment. These threads come together through our strategies and key initiatives such as RAIN.

Conserving Native Forest, Replenishing Water. 
In northern Uruguay, the Lunarejo Valley provides a unique refuge for native flora and fauna. But over the last decade, the Valley’s biodiversity, water resources and soil health have been threatened by overgrazing, logging, and population growth. Since 2017, Coca-Cola de Uruguay, together with INDRA Foundation and AVINA have worked in alliance with producers, families, NGOs and government institutions toward a goal of protecting at least 3,000 hectares of the native forest of the Lunarejo Valley. In 2020 we have reached 3,000 hectares protected through agreements with producers on sustainable water use, native forest and soil conservation and the promotion of rural ecotourism.
Fighting Poverty Through Water Access. 
Coca-Cola Foundation Philippines, through its Agos Program, collaborated with Del Monte Foundation, Inc. Philippines and the local government unit of Barangay Kulasi in Sumilao, Bukidnon to provide farmers and their families access to clean and potable water. Before the construction of the water system, villagers had to walk to and queue up at a single faucet. Now, they have 25 community faucets, which has also allowed increased production of crops and vegetables. The project lifted the poorest community members out of extreme poverty and enabled 61 families to install sanitary toilets. By making safe water accessible to more families, projects like this also reduce the incidence of water-borne diseases.
Wetlands to the Rescue. 
In southwest Ontario, Canada, draining of wetlands over time has led to increased runoff and pollution of Lake Erie. In partnership with The Coca-Cola Foundation, Ducks Unlimited Canada and Ducks Unlimited, Inc. restored 22 wetlands totaling about 10 hectares through a naturebased solution that uses the wetlands to reduce runoff and nutrient pollution and slow the release of water. This “green infrastructure” approach cuts down on phosphorus entering Lake Erie, helping to prevent algal blooms and oxygen depletion that threaten both the ecosystem and human health. The restored wetlands are projected to treat 1.4 billion liters of water per year.

25 The Coca–Cola Company 2020 Business & ESG Report. 
Millions of people across Africa lack access to safe and clean water for drinking, cooking and basic sanitation. In 2009, backed by a $65 million commitment, The Coca-Cola Foundation introduced the Replenish Africa Initiative (RAIN) to improve water access— and measurably improve lives.
Over the course of a decade, RAIN made catalytic investments to impact more than 6 million people across 41 countries and territories through a range of water-based initiatives that were tailored to address local community needs. Managed by the Global Environment & Technology Foundation, RAIN harnessed resources from a vast network of more than 300 partners, including governments, the private sector and civil society to support projects with multiple socioeconomic benefits.
Many of the projects focused on improvements for water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), which took on added urgency in 2020 to reduce the spread of COVID-19. According to one recent study, only one-third of households in 16 subSaharan African countries have soap and water readily available at home to wash their hands.1. 
The initiative enabled the empowerment of more than 400,000 women through access to water, saving them significant time from water collection and creating opportunities for employment, entrepreneurship and skills generation through water-related projects in their communities. (Learn more about our 5by20 initiative.) RAIN also provided more than 1,200 schools with clean water access, sanitation facilities, handwashing stations and hygiene training. With reduced risks of disease and absenteeism, children in these schools now have a healthier learning environment and an opportunity to reach their full potential.

Our Portfolio/ Reducing Added Sugar. 
In 2020, we announced plans to streamline our beverage lineup in order to improve efficiency and drive brand building and innovation. The new portfolio will focus on brands with the greatest potential to scale and grow.
To keep pace with the evolving needs and tastes of consumers, we’re staying focused on the four key actions at the heart of our beverage strategy:
Reducing added sugar across our portfolio Offering a portfolio of drinks with nutrition and hydration benefits. 
Providing smaller package choices so it’s easier for consumers to control added sugar intake Giving people the information they need to make informed choices. 
Transforming Our Portfolio


28 The Coca–Cola Company 2020 Business & ESG Report 1 The calories per pack metric takes into account both levers to reduce sugar: recipe changes and package size changes. 2 Average calories per pack for 2018 and 2019 have been updated to reflect a more complete data set. 3 This metric is based on the number of products in our beverage portfolio.
Original Taste, Less Sugar. 
In some markets around the world, zero-calorie beverages have not yet developed a strong consumer base. But many consumers tell us they want more drinks that have less sugar and fewer calories than our original recipes. In response, we have created reduced sugar variations of our classic Coca-Cola recipe. Our Coca-Cola recipe with 30% less sugar began in Mexico in 2018, and has since expanded to nearly 40 countries globally.
We participate in nearly 40 calorie/sugar reduction initiatives globally.
4 Low- or no-sugar products have between zero and 5g of added sugar per 100 ml. 5 The company acquired Costa in January 2019. In 2019, with the exception of ready-to-drink products, the company did not report unit case volume for Costa. However, unit case volume in 2020 includes both ready-to-drink and nonready-to-drink Costa products. 6 Average sugar per 100 ml for 2019 has been updated to reflect a more complete data set.
Smaller packaging options aim to help people control added sugar intake more easily for themselves and their families. Globally, about 42% of our sparkling soft drink brands come in packages of 250 ml (8.5 oz) or less.

Sugar Reduction Initiatives. 
In cooperation with our industry peers, we participate in many sugar reduction initiatives around the world, tailoring our approach to help reduce intake of added sugars to meet expectations of local consumers and stakeholders.
The European soft drink industry, UNESDA, announced in 2020 that the industry collectively reduced added sugars in drinks across Europe by an average of 14.6% between 2015 and 2019, exceeding the 10% reduction commitment.
In the UK, Public Health England’s October 2020 Sugar Reduction Progress Report found that Coca-Cola Great Britain achieved a 24% reduction for sparkling beverages between 2015 and 2019, exceeding a voluntary 20% reduction target.
The Coca-Cola system in Australia exceeded its commitment to reduce sugar by 10% by 2020 from a 2015 baseline, achieving an overall reduction of 11.2%. This reduction forms part of an industrywide pledge coordinated by the Australian Beverages Council for a 10% sugar reduction by 2020 and 20% by 2025.
In North America, we’re part of the American Beverage Association’s Balance Calories Initiative, which has committed to decrease beverage calories in the American diet by 20% per person by 2025. According to an interim report released in September 2020, beverage calories had fallen by 5.6% from 2014 to 2019; the report noted that 2019 represented the largest single-year reduction in calorie consumption—and the third consecutive year of calorie decreases. While we were pleased the report showed a decrease in calories, we recognize there’s much work to be done to achieve the 20% reduction by 2025. The Mexican Beverage Industry Association, meanwhile, has committed to reducing the calorie content of its member companies’ portfolios by 20% between 2018 and 2024.
Average sugar per 100 ml Unit case volume growth 2% -3% -6% -1% 2019 2% -2% 2018 2020 2% –3% –6% –1% 2019 2% –2% 2018 2020. 
In 2020, average sugar per 100 ml declined slightly along with an overall decline in sales, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The previous year, we reduced added sugar while increasing global sales.5, 6. 
POWERADE™ has grown its zerosugar, zero-calorie options over the last five years, which aided in a 22% calorie reduction across total volume.

tons of added sugar removed on an annualized basis through recipe changes in 2020.
~125,000 of our 20 top brands are low- or no-sugar or have a low- or no-sugar option, and ~36%3 of our beverage portfolio is low- or no-sugar.4 18 Reducing Added Sugar. 
Leading health authorities recommend that individuals should consume no more than 10% of their total daily calories from added sugar. The Coca-Cola Company embraces this recommendation, providing choices that support what consumers want and need.
Sugar reduction remains a top priority, and we continue to adjust our recipes to reduce added sugar, promote low- and no-calorie beverage options, and make smaller packages more available to enable portion control. Over the past decade we have invested heavily in natural sweetener research leading to the discovery, development and commercialization of sweeteners by The Coca-Cola Company and partners.
We’re exploring and bringing to market new alternatives that maintain the great tastes people love but with less added sugar and fewer calories. Globally, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar has become a popular alternative to our original formula and has continued to show strong growth in 2020.
We track the results of our sugarreduction efforts; the majority of the added-sugar reductions stem from changes to our sparkling beverage recipes and packaging size reductions. Average calories per pack1 dropped by 2.3% in 2018 and by another 7.0% in 20192; in 2020, however, average calories per pack increased by 4.9%— the result of a shift in consumer purchasing patterns due to the pandemic, as many outlets were closed. This led to a decrease in individual servings and out-of-home consumption and an increase in purchases of larger pack sizes for sharing at home.

2 Except where otherwise indicated, where reference is made in this report to 100% Recycled PET or 100% Recycled Plastic Beverage Packaging, we are referring to the material from which the plastic bottle is made, not the cap and label.
Many packaging formats have a role to play in delivering our beverages, including glass, PET plastic, aluminum, refillable bottles and even virtually package-less solutions. We are working to make all of our packaging more sustainable.

New Virgin Plastic. 
Reduction Goal. 
We have set a new goal to reduce our use of virgin plastic derived from non-renewable sources by a cumulative 3 million metric tons over the next five years. In 2025, depending on business growth, we project that we will use approximately 20% less virgin plastic than we do today as we ramp up adoption of recycled materials, pursue our lightweighting initiatives and expand our use of refillable, fountain and virtually package- less models.
Design REFILLABLE PACKAGING. 
COVID-19 accelerated our focus on refillable packaging, which addresses both affordability and sustainability concerns. In 2020, Colombia and other new Brazilian territories adopted the “universal bottle” first developed by Coca-Cola Brazil to drive efficiency by using the same package for multiple core brands, an innovation now available in: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Guatemala and Panama. And, in Chile, we partnered with Petrobras to launch a pilot to sell returnable bottles in convenience stores.
According to research conducted with Ipsos, the pandemic has made people more aware of packaging waste and driven preference for refillable packages. To address these trends, our global customer and commercial team is rolling out a holistic refillables strategy, including a guidebook to help markets implement localized plans.
As of 2020, reusable bottles represented more than 25% of sales in Coca-Cola Latin America and were the fastest-growing packaging format in 2018 and 2019.

Packaging Innovations. 
Some plastics have high value and lend themselves to being part of the circular economy. Others are hard to reuse or recycle and have little value. We are prioritizing and recycling higher-value plastics and turning them into new bottles, replacing hard-to-recycle plastics, and innovating with new technologies to advance circularity for plastics in the middle.
Highlights of our 2020 sustainable packaging innovations include: • Introduced a label-less 100% rPET bottle in Japan, for the I LOHAS natural mineral water brand, to simplify material sorting and recycling. • Developed and commercialized resealable caps made from 30% recycled plastic—a beverage industry first—for DASANI bottles in the United States. • Coca-Cola European Partners (CCEP) introduced CanCollar®, a paperboardbased ring solution for multipack cans, in Spain. • Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company (HBC) began the rollout of KeelClip™ technology in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Austria as the first step in its commitment to replace plastic wrap on all can multipacks in its European Union markets.
100% Recycled PET. 
PET, our highest-volume packaging material, is valuable, versatile, lightweight, recyclable and can be made into refillable bottles. We now offer beverages packaged in 100% recycled PET plastic (rPET)2 in around 30 markets. In 2020, the Netherlands and Norway announced transitions to 100% rPET for their entire plastic packaging portfolios, joining their neighbors in Sweden.
In early 2021, our North America business announced a series of 100% rPET innovations spanning our portfolio and including multiple brands and packaging sizes.
Combined, these innovations will result in a 20% reduction in use of new (virgin) plastic across our North American portfolio compared to 2018 and collectively reduce an estimated 10,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually.
Low oil prices made virgin plastic much less expensive in 2020, expanding the cost difference between virgin and recycled PET, yet we continued to work with suppliers and partners to drive the availability of recycled PET and reduce premiums for the material.
See additional performance indicators in the Data Appendix.

Our sustainability priorities are interconnected, so we approach them holistically. Since packaging accounts for 25% to 30% of our overall carbon footprint, our World Without Waste strategy is essential to meeting our Science-Based Target for climate. We lower our carbon footprint one package at a time by developing advanced, plantbased packaging that requires less fossil fuel; by lightweighting our packaging; by focusing on refillable, fountain and Coca-Cola Freestyle solutions; and by investing in local recycling programs to collect plastic bottles so they can become new ones.
1 The collection rates represent total collection rates for all primary consumer packaging, which is the percentage of our packaging that was collected, recycled or refilled.

We strive to make beverage packaging part of the circular economy. We fundamentally believe that our packaging materials have value and that we need to capture that value and prevent it from becoming waste at the end of its life. Our goal is to create closed loop systems, extracting the maximum value from materials and products while in use, and then recovering and reusing or recycling them.
COVID-19 had an impact on collection rates in 2020. Some municipalities initially suspended formal and informal return programs, which affected collection rates as well as availability of recycled PET or aluminum to be used for new packaging. Collection has resumed by and large, and we believe this was a temporary challenge that will be resolved as markets continue to open.
PACKAGING MATERIAL MIX. 
COLLECTION RATES BY TYPE1. 
We continued to partner with NGOs, industry peers and local and state governments around the world in 2020 to advance bottle collection and recycling: • We joined the U.S. Plastics Pact, championed by The Recycling Partnership, WWF and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, to partner with state and local governments as well as other businesses and NGOs to ensure the plastics we use stay in a circular economy and out of the environment. This builds on the American Beverage Association’s Every Bottle Back program (launched in 2019), which is marshaling nearly $500 million to educate consumers and improve recycling systems. Similarly, on Jan. 27, 2021, Coca-Cola joined 30 other companies, including customers Loblaw and Walmart, in launching the Canadian Plastics Pact. • In Indonesia, through an industry coalition called PRAISE, we worked with peer companies and government partners to launch the country’s first Packaging Recovery Organization (PRO) to increase collection and recycling of post-consumer packaging waste.
This effort is designed to be an integral part of circular economy implementation in Indonesia and to support the government’s objective to reduce plastic marine debris by 70% by 2025. • In Kenya, recycling rates increased from 5% in 2018 to approximately 40% in 2020 through joint industry efforts to support the PET Recycling Company (PETCO) recycling model. We have launched similar programs in Ethiopia and Tanzania, building on this successful model first developed in South Africa.
Deposit Schemes. 
To increase our recycled content, we need to replace virgin plastic with more recycled material and help to build the markets that provide the recycled materials. We are actively involved in local deposit systems in more than 35 markets and have more than 40 years of experience operating within these systems. We have been vocal about support for well-designed, well-managed. 
Deposit Return Schemes (DRS) in markets including Australia, France and the UK. The most effective programs encourage more people to recycle more plastic, while ensuring high-quality collection.

We remain committed to help drive collective action, working with stakeholders, suppliers, nonprofits, communities, customers and industry peers to invest in recycling innovation, facilities, organizations and initiatives.
Asia Circulate Capital, an investment fund focused on ventures, infrastructure and innovations that prevent the flow of plastic into oceans and advance the circular economy, took steps in 2020 to invest in seven pioneering companies in India and Indonesia using technology to fight plastic pollution and transform the waste management and recycling value chain. This includes two Indian companies poised to become the first food-grade, bottle-to-bottle rPET producers in that market. We were an inaugural investor in the fund, which has raised more than $100 million since its launch in 2019.
Thailand Part of a global initiative to remove waste from rivers, The Coca-Cola Foundation and Benioff Ocean Initiative have partnered with the TerraCycle Thai Foundation to install two marine waste traps in the Lat Phrao Canal to reduce debris entering into the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok, Thailand. From mid June to December 2020, over 133 metric tonnes of waste was collected from the canal, with a highest daily collection rate of nearly 2.5 tonnes in a single day.
Global Joined The Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) Plastic Waste Coalition of Action, a CEO-led effort to develop a framework for Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) programs to support the improvement and development of waste management systems around the world. The Coalition published an aligned position on extended producer responsibility (EPR) and is now working to advance more progressive policy in key priority countries.
Ghana Coca-Cola joined the steering committee for Africa’s first national Plastic Action Partnership in Ghana. Ghana generates more than 1 million tons of plastic waste per year, with only 5% collected for recycling. We are working with more than 120 affiliated partners to support Ghana in the transition toward a fully circular economy for plastics.
Europe Our R&D team in Brussels collaborated with Danish startup Paboco to develop a recyclable paper bottle prototype, which will be piloted in 2021 via an online retailer in Hungary with our plant-based beverage brand AdeZ.1. 
Philippines Coca-Cola Beverages. 
Philippines signed an agreement with Indorama Ventures to establish PETValue, the country’s largest bottle-to-bottle recycling facility, capable of processing almost 2 billion plastic bottles per year. Indorama Ventures—our largest PET supplier—recently purchased and is expanding PET recycling facilities in Brazil and Poland, adding to their recycling facilities in Mexico, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Thailand and the Philippines joint venture.
World Without Waste. 
Global Signed a business manifesto calling for a UN treaty on plastic pollution to urgently address the fragmented landscape of regulation, and complement existing voluntary measures, and as such help drive the transition to a circular economy for plastic—at speed and scale. We fully support this initiative for a global agreement to tackle plastic pollution, led by WWF, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, and others.


34 The Coca–Cola Company 2020 Business & ESG Report. 
Since global challenges such as plastic waste and climate change are far too great for any single government, company or industry to solve, partnership is more critical than ever. The need to further align our advocacy efforts and our sustainability goals served as a catalyst for greater collaboration and more proactive engagement in 2020—a year in which we worked to drive meaningful policy change with business peers, civil society organizations and all levels of government.
“The pandemic has further highlighted the need for collaboration among business, government and civil society through effective policymaking, which sets the framework for engagement and action,” said Michael Goltzman, Vice President of Global Policy and Sustainability, The Coca-Cola Company. “By actively participating in these discussions, we seek to provide informed, constructive contributions that create shared value for our business, our planet and society as a whole.”
Recycling and Reuse. 
An efficient circular economy for our packaging requires collaboration and financing. Use of recycled materials in our packaging is only possible when governments allow it and encourage it, and the same is true for effective waste management and recycling systems.
Like many issues, no globally accepted standard exists for food-grade recycled content PET (rPET), so we must work with governments, often through trade associations, to provide evidence of the safety and quality of recycled materials. To expand the Coca-Cola system’s use of rPET in our packaging, we have engaged with industry partners to work with governments to establish rPET standards for food and beverage packaging. Over the last year, three governments set such standards: Bangladesh, Egypt and Nigeria.
We work with policymakers and industry partners to advocate for effective Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) systems that provide an efficient, financially sustainable collection program for all recyclable materials to ensure we can collect more bottles and cans for recycling and reuse. Recently, we developed an industry position on the optimal design of EPR programs through the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) Plastic Waste Coalition of Action—extending beyond the beverage industry. And we continue to support well-designed, well-managed Deposit Return Schemes in more than 35 markets to increase packaging collection that provides the raw material to create more recycled content for our bottles.
In 2020, we joined the U.S. Plastics Pact, championed by The Recycling Partnership, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to partner with state and local governments to enable legislation that drives toward a circular economy. The U.S. Plastics Pact builds on the American Beverage Association’s Every Bottle Back initiative, which is marshaling nearly $500 million to educate consumers and improve recycling systems with state-of- the-art infrastructure, including $4 million invested in 2020 to recycle nearly 38 million pounds of PET plastic in Dallas, Texas; Kenosha, Wis.; and Oklahoma City, Okla. Similarly, in January 2021, we joined 30 other companies, including customers Loblaw and Walmart, in launching the Canadian Plastic Pact.
In Ghana, building on the model first tested in Indonesia, through the World Economic Forum’s Global Plastic Action Partnership (GPAP), we have a multistakeholder, national action plan in place for plastics. And we continue to explore opportunities to expand the PET Recycling Company (PETCO) model—an industry body first introduced in South Africa that promotes and regulates PET recycling, and partners with recyclers to create new products made from recycled PET—to other countries in Africa, including Kenya, where recycling rates for PET packaging have increased from 5% to around 40% in the first two years of implementation.
We also joined more than 30 other companies in signing a business manifesto calling for a global UN treaty on plastic pollution to urgently address the fragmented regulatory landscape and accelerate progress toward a circular economy for plastics, supporting an existing call from WWF and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Collectively, we believe a global framework of goals and targets, together with national government action plans and consistent measurement, are needed to harmonize policy efforts, enhance investment planning, stimulate innovation and coordinate infrastructure development.
Climate Action. 
In 2020, we took steps to support several policy positions that align with our climate reduction targets. We were part of the working group that developed the Business Roundtable’s (BRT) updated climate position announced in October 2020. The statement outlines high-level climate actions U.S. federal policymakers can take and calls for public/private partnerships to achieve the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions outlined in the Paris Agreement.
We also joined a coalition of companies in successfully petitioning the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to update its policy on climate change. We sent a letter encouraging the Chamber to embrace the BRT statement and continue to play an active role in both the Chamber’s Climate Task Force Advisory Group and Climate Solutions Working Group.
We supported “America Is All In,” a statement made by the “We Are Still In” movement calling on U.S. President Joe Biden and his administration to rejoin the Paris Agreement. The coalition of nearly 4,000 NGO, business, government and civil society leaders (with coordination from WWF) supports aggressive plans to address the dual threats of climate change and COVID-19.

Climate. 
Climate change is a priority issue for our business and, as a global company, we have a long-standing strategy to reduce our carbon footprint.
Our approach to climate is threefold: to reduce the impact our business has on the climate, manage risks and impacts climate change has on us, and partner with others to make an even greater contribution.
We continue to track and report our progress, and revise our goals to drive improved performance and ambition. We develop solutions related to many interconnected climate-related issues, including ingredient and raw material scarcity, more frequent and severe natural disasters, water stress, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy management and packaging. We also recognize that the impacts of climate change are not equally felt across geographies and populations, which can exacerbate inequality and social unrest and in turn affect our business.
To ensure we address these risks—and leverage key opportunities—we have taken several actions. We have increased the ambition and reach of our climate goals across the system. Along with the actions described in this section, we are also committed to climate action integrated with other priority sustainability issues. For example, climate resilience is a key aspect of our water strategy. Our sustainable agriculture practices include a focus on lower carbon. 
PHASE CHANGE IN CLIMATE GOALS. 
Our ambition is to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 2020. 
Our “drink in your hand” goal, to reduce relative carbon emissions by 25% by 2020 against a 2010 baseline—achieved on target. 
We see the journey as a three-phased approach: 2030. 
Our 2030 ScienceBased Target, to reduce absolute GHG emissions 25% by 2030 2050. 
Ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. 
Our Science-Based Target is a critical step toward our 2050 net zero ambition. This target is based on a warming scenario below 2˚C. As we stretch toward our ambition to be net zero by 2050, we will also evolve our strategy to be on a 1.5°C path2.
emissions. And our World Without Waste Program contributes significantly to our GHG reduction goals.
Science-Based Targets in the Coca-Cola System. 
Our target to reduce absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by 25% by 2030 is aligned with the climate science reflected in the Paris Agreement. We also support a vision to be net zero carbon by 2050, and our Science-Based Target is a critical milestone that supports this longer-term ambition.
Our target represents the emissions the Coca-Cola system must reduce to contribute our fair share to global efforts, in alignment with the guidance of the Science-Based Targets initiative.
Our target builds on our long-standing commitment to reducing our carbon footprint, and is the next phase after our “drink in your hand” target. Instead of a relative target to reduce emissions per package, it is an absolute target to reduce our total GHG emissions by 25%, regardless of our volume growth. Our goal decouples GHG emissions from our sales growth, an approach that is more aligned with industry best practice.
Achieving these reductions will require us to continue the progress we have made over the last few years. The work we are doing through sustainable agriculture and product reformulations will help us to achieve the target. As we look at our ingredients, we are assessing which have the highest GHG footprint, and then putting in place plans to switch ingredients and work with suppliers to reduce our impact.
Likewise, our investments in renewable energy, combined with increased adoption of low-carbon technologies, will contribute. And, since packaging accounts for almost one-third of our overall carbon footprint,3 our World Without Waste strategy is essential for us to meet this target. By developing advanced, plantbased packaging that requires less petroleum-based virgin plastic, through light-weighting our packaging, by focusing on refillable, fountain and Coca-Cola Freestyle solutions, and by investing in local recycling programs to collect old bottles so they can become new ones, we are lowering our carbon footprint to contribute to this target.
However, new programs will still be needed to reach the target. And because up to 90% of the carbon footprint of our business is embedded in the things we buy, we know there must be a major focus on engaging suppliers. To that end, beyond our existing efforts in packaging and agricultural procurement, we are implementing more robust supplier engagement programs on cold drink equipment and renewable energy.
In addition, several of our bottling partners have announced their own Science-Based Targets, which will help drive even more positive climate action across the Coca-Cola system. These include Coca-Cola European Partners, Swire Coca-Cola Limited (Asia), Coca-Cola FEMSA (Mexico) and Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company AG (Switzerland).

Renewable Energy Commitments. 
Transitioning to renewable energy in the production of our products in every region will be essential to meeting our global climate goals, as we estimate that manufacturing currently accounts for as much as 15% of our GHG emissions. To this end, we created a Renewable Energy Guide to help local teams make informed decisions on potential investments, and we have been working locally in several markets to embrace renewable energy initiatives.
These efforts are having an impact. In 2019, 15% of our system’s electricity demand was met with renewable sources. In 2020, we increased that to 17%.

38 The Coca–Cola Company 2020 Business & ESG Report. 
WATER STRESS. 
Among several potential exposures identified in our assessments, “water scarcity disrupting sourcing and/or production” was found to be the highest potential exposure. Water is a critical ingredient to our products and essential in the production of many of our ingredients. And, of course, the communities in which we operate require supplies of water. Disruption in the supply of available freshwater would create challenges across our value chains. For example, the assessment indicated that approximately $946 million of annual revenue is dependent upon bottling facilities in India that operate in areas considered to have high baseline water stress. For this reason, building climate resilience into our water strategy—including replenishing, improvements in efficiency of usage, and source water assessments—is critical to addressing water stress as a business risk. See the water section for more detail on our water risk assessments and our approach to addressing water-related risks.
INGREDIENT AVAILABILITY. 
A top priority climate-related risk was “changes to weather and precipitation patterns limiting the availability of ingredients and raw materials.” This has the potential to impact a broad set of products and markets, as well as long-term growth strategies. For example, on average, 71% by volume of our beverage products contain some amount of sugar or corn-derived sweetener, globally. In the United States, our products use corn-derived sweeteners and a significant portion of our product portfolio is dependent on the production of U.S.-grown corn. If this commodity is negatively impacted by climate change, the total estimated revenue amount impacted ranges from $1.6 billion to $4.6 billion annually.
We consider these climate change impacts, and the associated impacts on water scarcity and weather-related risks in the growing (i.e., sourcing) of agricultural ingredients, to be critical issues to continue to monitor. By working with our ingredient suppliers to practice more sustainable forms of agricultural production, we aim to address these risks.
CLIMATE SCENARIO ANALYSIS. 
In 2018-2019, as part of our climate-related risk assessment, we selected two key risks and conducted both a qualitative and quantitative scenario analysis. We applied the Business As Usual (IEA NPS) and 2° (REMIND) scenarios and considered a 2030 time horizon.
Two climate-related risks identified were the impacts of extreme weather events on production and distribution; and the increase of regulation on GHG and/or water, which could impact pricing and production.

Climate Governance: Managing for Resilience. 
We have several processes to ensure that risks relevant to climate change are periodically evaluated. We regularly discuss top risks with company leadership, including the Board of Directors, and recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) also inform our approach.
From a corporate perspective, we develop and issue climate strategy guidance across the business. This corporate guidance is developed by a core team driving our corporate strategy on issues related to climate change, with input from a broad set of functions, such as Enterprise Risk Management, Procurement, Operations, Technical and Public Affairs and Sustainability, as well as some of our geographical operating units and bottling partners.
Each operating unit, function or department is responsible for actively managing and monitoring its respective risks throughout the year. Relevant risks that could materially affect our business and financial results are disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Business Continuity. 
The results of our climate risk assessments are included in the corporate Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) risk process taxonomy, and through this, the impacts of climate change are captured. For example, the company’s ERM process informs the Business Continuity Planning (BCP) process to mitigate these impacts of climate change. With a dedicated business continuity manager at each of our concentrate production sites, the BCP process allocates at least 6,000 hours per year to risk management and planning; their priorities are informed by the ERM process, which includes climate-change information.
Further, we connect key ESG decisions through the ERM lens, for example during our priority issues assessment and stakeholder engagement process, which helps to inform key business decisions.
Potential Exposures to Climate Change Impacts. 
We have mapped potential exposures we may have to climate change impacts across our entire value chain on three dimensions: the effects of extreme weather events; the longer-term impacts of a changing climate; and potential changes to markets in which we operate, aligned with the TCFD’s taxonomy for climate risks (Acute and Chronic Physical, and Transition) outlined in the index.
To further our understanding, we assess the ways in which our business could be exposed to the impacts of climate change based on various scientific climate scenarios. In 2020, in addition to our disclosures in CDP, we began assessing the exposure of some of our key agricultural crops and geographies, across select climate change parameters.


39 The Coca–Cola Company 2020 Business & ESG Report. 
For more than a decade, we have encouraged our suppliers to report to CDP.
Approximately 85% of our overall carbon footprint lies in our supply chain. Therefore, engaging suppliers is critical to achieving our Science- Based Target.
Among all of our suppliers, approximately 70% of our total emissions reside in four key sourcing categories: sugar, metals, plastic, and glass. For these categories, we have begun pilots with several partners to gather supplier-specific emissions data to integrate into our own calculations. For examples of our work with packaging suppliers, see the World Without Waste section.
Building on our ongoing supplier engagement efforts, in 2020 we shared our renewed commitment to sustainability with our key suppliers through a letter from our Chief Procurement Officer and Chairman of our bottling partners’ Cross Enterprise Procurement Group. This letter emphasized the importance of our continued partnership with suppliers to achieve our sustainability goals, clarifying our approach to date and providing an update on new elements of our strategy. The letter provides context on our Science-Based Target and highlights the role of suppliers to achieve our planned Scope 3 reductions. It also motivates supplier action by providing information on our 2021 goal to have 95% of direct and authorized suppliers comply with our Supplier Guiding Principles, upholding our Human Rights Policy.
Across all areas of sustainability, we are increasing our focus on transparency to better identify risks and opportunities within our value chains. Many of our stakeholders expect this transparency, and with much of our collective impact resting within our supply chains, increased transparency is essential for advancing our sustainability goals.
Supplier Engagements Advance Climate Action.

Since 2013, our goal has been to more sustainably source our priority agricultural ingredients.
For The Coca-Cola Company, “sustainably sourced” means our suppliers can demonstrate that the farms growing our ingredients meet one of a suite of leading global sustainability standards that are aligned with our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA) and cover human and workplace rights, environmental protection, responsible farm management and animal health and welfare.
Approved global standards can be found on our website and include Bonsucro for sugar, the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform – Farm Sustainability Assessment (SAI-FSA) for multiple ingredients and Field to Market for U.S. corn.
Refreshing Our Policies: New Principles for Sustainable Agriculture. 
During 2020, we conducted a comprehensive review of our policies and principles for sustainable agriculture, including the launch of our first Animal Health and Welfare Guiding Principles and our new PSAs, which are replacing the Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGP). Based on the input of multiple stakeholders and experts, we updated and strengthened our expectations on sustainable agriculture practices across our ingredients and plant-based packaging materials—for example on human rights, labor and income, the protection of water sources, ecosystems, forests and biodiversity, as well as animal welfare. We also introduced a comprehensive bottler and supplier governance system for sustainable agriculture, which aims to encourage continuous improvement toward credible global assurance schemes and standards across our agriculture supply chain.
Understanding Risks in Our Ingredient Supply Chain. 
With our vast and global supply chain, it is critical that we aim our attention at the areas of greatest risk and opportunity for influencing change. We conducted a comprehensive risk review of our priority ingredients, working with partners like WWF and external indices such as the U.S. Bureau of International Labor Affairs’ List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor to build a picture of the risks associated with those ingredients in the origins from which we source. As an example, sugar cane was identified as an ingredient with inherent risk. To better understand risks in sugar cane, we have been conducting country studies in key markets to understand the risk of child labor, forced labor and land rights in key markets. We have published 21 reports to date, some of which highlight operational as well as broader structural risk factors. Based on these insights, we are engaging specific suppliers to improve ongoing due diligence and build collaborative remediation approaches.
Strengthening Our Dairy Supply Chain. 
As our portfolio has diversified and expanded, so too has our footprint in the dairy industry. As a result, we worked with globally recognized experts to establish a comprehensive set of Animal Health and Welfare Guiding Principles, which are also reflected in the PSA.
Embedded in the Guiding Principles are the Five Freedoms of Animal Welfare, requirements for continuous improvement of specific practices on dairy farms, and a commitment to work with cross-industry initiatives such as the SAI Sustainable Dairy Partnership to advance dairy animal welfare standards globally.
Learn more about sustainability progress from one of our dairy brands, fairlife, in their Annual Stewardship Report.
Disclosing Our Supply Chain Partners. 
We recognize the important work that stakeholders such as Oxfam have undertaken to encourage and promote greater levels of transparency in this area. To provide greater insight and transparency of our ingredient supply chain, we have published a list of Tier 1 suppliers of our top four global ingredients by volume. The list represents the top 80% of our global spend in cane sugar, beet sugar, corn (high fructose corn syrup) and orange juice.

Our complex agricultural supply chain provides ingredients from countries around the world, involving large- and small-scale farmers and supplier companies, among other actors. Many of the risks in our supply chain are systemic and can only be tackled effectively through industry alignment and precompetitive collaboration. In addition to working directly with our suppliers to encourage sustainable practices, we have also helped to build the institutional capacity to support the transition to sustainable agriculture, for example, through collective action in the Bonsucro and SAI platforms.
We track progress against our sustainable sourcing goal for 12 global priority1 ingredients, which represent about 80% of our total annual agricultural ingredient purchases. In 2020, 56% of these ingredient volumes were sustainably sourced, up from 54% in 2019 and 8% in 2013 at the beginning of the program.
2020 has been a challenging year, with COVID-19 impacting the ability of our suppliers to arrange on-farm assessments, as well as our ability to meet with suppliers and farmers.
Progress Toward Our 2020 Goal. 
While this has had an impact on our performance in cane sugar and corn, which account for a significant proportion of our overall volume, we have improved across most of our other priority ingredients.
While we’re proud of the progress we’ve made toward our ambitious 2020 goal, we have not achieved it for all ingredients. We continue to push forward with our integrated approach to ensuring sustainable practices across our agricultural supply chain. Promoting a Simply™ Sustainable Almond Supply. 
As consumers seek out alternatives to dairy, almond beverages have become increasingly popular. Almond milk has a lower environmental footprint but relatively high water needs compared to other dairy alternatives. Partnering with our supplier, Treehouse California Almonds, and our Simply brand, which sources all of its almonds from California, in 2020 we began a water replenishment project in the watershed of one of our primary almond sourcing locations. When up and running in 2021, this project alone will help replenish the equivalent of approximately 20% of the water used to grow and process Simply’s almond supply.
Working with Treehouse California Almonds, we have also encouraged the growers in our supply chain to participate in the California Almond Sustainability Program (CASP), which provides tools for sustainable practices and performance tracking. By the end of 2020, 100% of the acres supplying our company were participating in the program.

Through an innovative collaboration with Tate & Lyle, one of our ingredient partners, and Truterra, a conservation solutions provider, we are supporting U.S. Midwestern corn growers to implement sustainable agriculture practices on land equivalent to acres used to grow the corn used in our products.
Participating farmers use cutting-edge technology and a network of agronomy advisors to embed up to 26 conservation practices, including ones that improve soil health, protect biodiversity and potentially sequester carbon. The Coca-Cola Company was Tate & Lyle’s first customer to pilot the program, which is part of the Field to Market program and now covers 1.5 million acres of sustainably grown corn.
Results from 148,000 acres continuously enrolled since the start of the pilot have demonstrated the impacts of the program: 10% reduction in greenhouse gases; 6% reduction in topsoil erosion; and 4% improvement in the soil conditioning index, an indicator of soil quality and its ability to retain carbon.
Strengthening Recruitment and Farming Practices in Mexico. 
Since 2017, we have been working in Mexico with Solidaridad and others to support 16 sugar mills and mill-owned farms, training farmers on sustainable agricultural practices, with a focus on women and youth, and advising mills on responsible recruitment practices.
• 600+ farmers trained • 13,000+ hectares of land under agronomy best practice • 1,700 workers benefitting from improved practices. 
We are also founding members of ASACAM, an alliance of companies, industry associations and the Mexican government, working together to drive improvements across the sugar cane sector in responsible recruitment and farm resilience, and to reduce negative environmental impacts.

Protecting Water Through Sustainable Practices in the UK. 
WWF and Coca-Cola have been working together in the UK since 2012 to protect and replenish unique rivers and streams while aiding supply chain sustainability in East Anglia, one of the most waterstressed areas of Great Britain and a major area of sugar beet production. The initiative has provided local farmers tailored advice to enrich soils and reduce runoff and nutrient leaching, which in turn helps to improve river health, water quality and habitats.
Over a three-year period, the program replenished around 1.2 billion liters of water, engaged thousands of farmers and directly supported more than 100 farmers to introduce more soil-sensitive practices, resulting in 4,000+ acres of land being farmed more sustainably. WWF and Coca-Cola have also piloted innovative watershed-scale programs with other food and drink businesses that source from the region to drive collective action on water issues.
Nurturing Sustainable Lemons and Native Forests. 
Citromax, a key lemon supplier in Argentina, has been working with The Coca-Cola Company to implement sustainable lemon growing practices while also restoring native forests.
In 2020, 100% of the lemons supplied to Coca-Cola by Citromax groves were produced at Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA) Gold level. This is demonstrated through their Global GAP + FSA add-on.
Citromax manages 59% of its own property as native forest, where it has been restoring populations of valuable trees, including mahogany, that have been removed through illegal logging. The remaining 41% is in citrus plantations. The company’s commercial nursery has raised 50,000 native trees for local reforestation to date.

Reorganizing for Future Growth. 
In 2020, we announced plans to redesign our organization, which included the difficult decision to reduce the number of Coca-Cola positions globally. We are accelerating our transformation and moving to a new, networked organizational structure. This will drive clearer decisionmaking and empower the company to focus on innovation and growth.
Making a Difference for People and Communities. 
People are at the heart of everything we do, from our employees to our customers to those who live in the communities we serve. We believe each one of us has the power to make a difference, and our company and The Coca-Cola Foundation have a long history of investing in programs and activities that improve lives.
We nurture a culture that values how we work as much as what we achieve—emphasizing inclusivity, empowerment, curiosity and agility. We champion diversity, equity and inclusion by building a workforce as diverse as the consumers we serve. And we use our global scale to be a force for progress and for good.
Our company’s impacts on people extend well beyond our own business. We are committed to caring for those who make our success possible, whether through respecting human rights across our operations and supply chain, empowering access to equal opportunities, supporting more sustainable agriculture practices, or giving back to communities through our philanthropic initiatives.

Overview


45 The Coca–Cola Company 2020 Business & ESG Report 45 The Coca–Cola Company 2020 Business & ESG Report. 
Our Human Rights Policy sets the framework for ensuring that we meet this commitment within our owned operations and those over which we have management control. Tools and training are provided to help our global operations abide by the policy. We encourage any suspected violation to be reported, which can be done through multiple channels, including an ethics hotline.
Our suppliers and system partners are also expected to embrace responsible workplace practices. Our Supplier Guiding Principles (SGP),1 which are aligned with our Human Rights Policy, are included in all contractual agreements between The Coca-Cola Company and our direct and authorized suppliers.
In 2020, we worked closely with our bottlers, audit partners and suppliers to help them maintain compliance with all of our policies and principles despite the many challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Because in-person audits were not always feasible, we developed a virtual audit program.
The pandemic has had dramatic impacts on employment, particularly on vulnerable workers within our supply chain, making it more important than ever that we reinforce our messages around safety and respect for human rights in the workplace and in our value chain.
Human Rights in the Agricultural Supply Chain. 
As part of a commitment to respect human rights across our value chain, The Coca-Cola Company engaged third parties to evaluate key human rights risks in our sugar supply chain. Since beginning the effort in 2013, we have published 21 country-specific studies focused on child labor, forced labor and land rights that have helped us better understand risks and overall systemic challenges and opportunities. Where risks were identified, we have followed up through direct remediation, supplier engagement and multi-stakeholder initiatives that are leading to improved human rights conditions.
Learn more about human rights in our top sugar sourcing countries in our interim summary report from 2019.
See additional performance indicators in the Data Appendix.
TRACKING PROGRESS. 
In 2003, we set a goal that 98% of our company locations and system bottlers and 95% of our direct and authorized suppliers will validate compliance with our Human Rights Policy and our SGPs by the end of 2020. The global pandemic, however, impacted our in-person audit capabilities, leading to a decrease in compliance percentages for 2020 and forcing us to push the goal date out to the end of 2021. As of Q4 2020, 93% of companyowned facilities, 90% of bottlers and 87% of suppliers reached compliance with our Human Rights Policy and SGPs.
1 SGP is part of all contractual agreements between The Coca-Cola Company and our direct and authorized suppliers. The Human Rights compliance metric reflects the performance of sites and suppliers critical to the development of the product, including company operations, bottling partners, co-packers and direct suppliers of ingredients, primary packaging and dispensing equipment. SGP audits may occur in other areas as well, such as trademarked marketing and promotional equipment; however, these are not included in the metric.
2,279 audits conducted in 2020. 
Our Human Rights Policy, our Supplier Guiding Principles and our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture help ensure that, as a system, we strive to create a positive impact in the communities where we operate, reduce social and environmental risks, and address issues when they arise. These policies and practices are aligned with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
Supporting Human Rights. 
Respect for human rights is at the foundation of our business and ingrained in our culture, guiding our interactions with employees, bottling partners, suppliers, customers, consumers and the communities we serve. Our commitment starts with our own employees, making sure they have safe, supportive and respectful workplaces where the dignity of every associate is recognized.
CENTRE FOR SPORT AND HUMAN RIGHTS. 
The Coca-Cola Company is a founding member of, and provides funding to, the Centre for Sport and Human Rights, which is committed to a world of sport that fully respects human rights. Respect for human rights is at the foundation of our business, and we’re advocating for these principles to be embedded in the work of our mega sport partners. As a member of the Centre’s advisory council, we’re working to create sporting events that are respectful and inclusive for all athletes, spectators and community members. Additionally, in Japan, we supported Pride House Tokyo, a safe space for LGBTQ athletes, as well as spectators and community members, at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 and beyond.

In 2010, we announced a global initiative to enable the economic empowerment of 5 million women entrepreneurs by the end of 2020.
A decade later, together with our public and private sector partners, including our bottling partners and The Coca-Cola Foundation, we are proud to say we surpassed our goal, known as 5by20®—enabling the economic empowerment of more than 6 million women by the end of 2020.

47 The Coca–Cola Company 2020 Business & ESG Report 47 The Coca–Cola Company 2020 Business & ESG Report. 
Surpassing Our 5by20 Goal. 
Our 5by20® initiative set out to address structural inequalities and economic barriers that women entrepreneurs face by providing business skills training, mentoring networks, financial services and other assets to support women and their businesses.
In 2013, we expanded the scope of 5by20 to allow for independent contributions by The Coca-Cola Foundation and other partners. Through generous grants from the Foundation, through its Women’s Entrepreneurship Empowerment pillar, and the company’s collaboration with our bottling partners, government agencies, community leaders and NGOs, scalable partnerships were developed to create and implement more than 300 programs across 100 countries.
By the end of 2020, we surpassed our goal, enabling the economic empowerment of more than 6 million women.1. 
Water stewardship is a core sustainability pillar for the company, and we have seen evidence that water is linked to women’s economic empowerment. A 2018 Ipsos research study2 explored the larger benefits to women through water access programs. (Learn more in the RAIN feature on page 25).
There are several lessons to be learned from our 5by20 programs. Effective partnerships with like-minded organizations—and the ability to scale and adapt programming to local challenges— were essential factors in achieving our goal. From the outset, we wanted our impact to be measurable, backed by data endorsed by stakeholders, and reviewed and assured by independent third parties.
While we are pleased to have surpassed our goal, we recognize the devastating impacts of COVID-19 on women in particular. The United Nations noted that even limited gender equality gains made over recent years risk being rolled back because of the pandemic.3. 
Our efforts to enable the economic empowerment of our communities, and to making a positive difference, will continue. However, the challenges facing female entrepreneurs across the world remain enormous. Collective and deliberate action over time— among the private sector, government and civil society—will be essential for transformative change. We intend to expand our current programs and industry engagement.

HARNESSING THE POWER OF TECHNOLOGY. 
Around the world, the use of technology is a powerful tool to enable economic empowerment. A number of the 5by20 programs provide online business skills training and mentorship opportunities for women to start or expand a business and network with their peers. Some of these programs enable women to achieve financial independence. In the Ukraine, for example, the #ICAN empowerment program, delivered by the Olena Pinchuk Foundation, offers online peer mentorship and networking opportunities for women seeking to grow their businesses. In the U.S., our support of digital programs run by the Adelante Movement, the Women’s Business Enterprise Council and the National Minority Supplier Development Council has helped women entrepreneurs of color strengthen their businesses and helped keep the initiatives running during the pandemic.

48 The Coca–Cola Company 2020 Business & ESG Report. 
In the Philippines, sari-sari stores are a ubiquitous element of local life—part convenience store, part gathering place and integral to the archipelago’s economy and culture. “Sari-sari” means “variety” or “sundry” in Tagalog, and the tiny one-stop-shops stock a broad range of foods, beverages and everyday necessities.
About 86% of the sari-sari owners and operators are women. Over the last decade, as part of our 5by20 commitment, The Coca-Cola Company has invested in targeted economic empowerment programs to support these female entrepreneurs, building their business skills and financial acumen.
But the COVID-19 pandemic hit sari-sari owners especially hard. According to the Philippine Association of Stores and Carinderia Owners, 42% of sari-sari stores and 75% of carinderias—small food stalls— were forced to close in the early months of 2020. Many of those that managed to stay open had trouble keeping their shelves stocked, forcing them to significantly downsize their operations.
Seeing an urgent need, Coca-Cola Philippines partnered with government agencies and two leading micro-finance institutions to create the Rebuilding Sari-Sari Stores Through Access to Resources and Trade (ReSTART) initiative. The program allocated approximately $3.2 million in loan packages to some 15,000 micro-retailers so they could reopen safely. The loan packages include 30% goods and products, and 70% cash, with low service fee rates from 0.0% to less than 1%. ReSTART also distributed “safe store” kits of plastic covers, personal protective equipment and safety information guidelines for retail shops.
Corazon, who runs a sari-sari store in Manila, received a loan to help her get back on her feet after suffering a large drop in sales and profits during COVID-19 lockdowns. “With the help of Coca-Cola, we are now doing OK, and we were able to get back to our usual business profits,” she said.
Annie, another loan recipient with a Manila-based shop, said support from ReSTART allowed her to get back to “almost normal” operations.
“Coca-Cola has long recognized the significant role that micro-retailers play in helping sustain the Philippine economy and our own business,” said Jonah De Lumen-Pernia, Coca-Cola Philippines Public Affairs and Communications Director. “The COVID-19 crisis did not change our commitment and in fact pushed us to go even further, ramping up our support to help their recovery. Indeed, their resilience is the nation’s resilience.” 48 The Coca–Cola Company 2020 Business & ESG Report 230,000+ women enabled in the Philippines since 2011 through our 5by20 STAR Program (Sari-Sari Store Training and Access to Resources) 15,000 women enabled through ReSTART.

Employee Safety & Health. 
We believe that a safe workplace is fundamental to our success as a company.
Employee safety took on added urgency in 2020 as we implemented rigorous countermeasures to protect our people from the spread of COVID-19 while continuing to support the needs of our customers and communities.
We quickly pivoted our global operations so most office-based associates could work from home. At the same time, we deployed protective equipment and tools for essential workers to stay safe in our production facilities and laboratories and across our distribution network. Our robust safety measures included enhanced cleaning and sanitation procedures, temperature monitoring, mask requirements and social distancing rules, and split shifts at manufacturing facilities to limit the number of people in a plant at any one time and ensure safe changeovers.
LEARN MORE: on page 6.
Safety Management. 
We give associates within the Coca-Cola system the tools, training and resources needed to ensure their safety, promoting a culture that empowers safe behavior across each element of our business. Our goal is to achieve zero work-related injuries and illnesses for all employees and contractors, driven by our vision of Zero Is Possible.
To help us get there, our Coca-Cola Operating Requirements (KORE) define the policies and standards for managing safety, the environment and product quality throughout our operations. KORE requires our manufacturing and distribution facilities to implement health and safety management systems that improve employee safety, reduce workplace risks and instill a mindset of continuous improvement.
In 2020, we invested in our digital Environmental Occupational Health and Safety (EOSH) performance management tools to give us greater visibility to expanded environmental and safety data system-wide and a better understanding of performance for targeted initiatives and business decision-making.
The new platform also helps us identify the precursors that can lead to serious injuries and fatalities—and thereby establish ways to prevent them. Alongside the protocols, we introduced our Life Saving Rules, a set of easy-to-understand, non-negotiable requirements to further prevent serious injuries and fatalities and effectively evaluate the strength of safety defenses in place.

See additional performance indicators in the Data Appendix.
VIRTUAL AUDIT PROCESS. 
In a typical year, we regularly conduct unannounced physical audits across operations and bottling partners as part of our push toward continuous improvement. During the pandemic, we took advantage of technology and switched to a Virtual Audit Process (VAP) framework to validate workplace safety as well as food safety, quality and environmental risks. The VAP also helped confirm and validate COVID-19 controls and countermeasures were effectively implemented.

50 The Coca–Cola Company 2020 Business & ESG Report 50 The Coca–Cola Company 2020 Business & ESG Report. 
Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) are at the heart of our purpose, values and growth strategy. We aspire to create a better shared future for people everywhere by fostering an inclusive culture in our own operations and advancing diversity, equity and inclusion in the markets we serve.
COVID-19 and the multiple social injustices witnessed globally in 2020 brought DEI to the forefront of communities around the world, including for our company, challenging us to take a hard look at where we were and where we need to be. In response, we developed a Global Social Justice Framework for Action, with four pillars:
LISTENING: We seek out the perspectives and expertise of employees, community leaders and social justice advocates to inform our actions.
LEADING: We have reviewed and updated our internal policies and practices—from recruitment to development to diverse representation across all job levels—to help ensure fairness. This includes rolling out DEI education for all employees globally.
INVESTING: We will invest our resources to advance important causes and use the voices of our brands to weigh in on important conversations. For example, in the United States, The Coca-Cola Foundation and the company (through our Coca-Cola and Sprite brands), have contributed more than $5 million to date through grants, company funds, in-kind donations and employee matching funds to social justice causes.
Accelerating Our Supplier Diversity Commitments. 
We are focused on increasing the overall diversity of our suppliers and are committed to spending $1 billion annually with diverse suppliers in the coming years. We are more than doubling our spending with Black-owned enterprises across our U.S. supply chain—by at least $500 million cumulatively—over the next five years. Related to this commitment, we announced new outside legal counsel guidelines in January 2021. U.S.-based law firms that service the company must commit that at least 30% of billed associate and partner time will be from diverse attorneys, with at least half of these amounts from Black attorneys.
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion. 
ADVOCATING: Together with our bottling system, we will leverage our network and resources to embrace public policies that matter. For example, Coca-Cola Brazil joined a coalition of consumer goods companies to create a plan to address structural racism in Brazil. As part of its racial equity action plan, the company’s Europe operating unit is working with 10 external racial-equity experts from countries all over the region to kickstart anti-racism action.
While the United States is at the epicenter, our framework is designed for global operating units to adapt and implement in the most meaningful and relevant ways locally. Learn about the creation of our Racial Equity Plan in the United States.
“ As a company that believes diversity, equity and inclusion are among our greatest strengths, we are putting in place resources and energy toward helping end the cycle of systemic racism. We don’t have all the answers. But I believe that, together with civic and community advocates, government officials, fellow business leaders and our partners—and with the views and voices of those who challenge injustice—we can find solutions.”
JAMES QUINCEY Chairman and Chief Executive Officer The Coca-Cola Company ~$800M spent by the Coca-Cola system with diverse suppliers in the U.S. in 2020. 
Reflecting the Diversity of Our Markets. 
Cultivating a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace is a strategic business priority that fuels greater creativity, innovation and connection for our company—and a sense of belonging for our employees. While we currently track and measure progress against gender globally and race and ethnicity in the United States, our inclusion efforts worldwide span five dimensions: gender identity, culture and heritage, generation and life experience, LGBTQ+, and ability and wellness.
Since 2012, our Multicultural Leadership Council (MLC) has advised senior leaders on goals, strategies and initiatives to advance People of Color within our organization in the United States. Comprised of leaders from across our North America operating unit and corporate functions, the MLC will help drive the initiatives in our Racial Equity Plan. We believe we can make a bigger impact toward a more inclusive world through collaboration. We recently joined The Valuable 500, a global movement to advance disability inclusion, and we signed on to the Partnership for Global LGBTI Equality, a coalition of organizations committed to accelerating LGBTI inclusion in the workplace and in communities. The partnership is supported by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and operates in collaboration with the World Economic Forum.

Pay Equity. 
Our approach to compensation is grounded in principles of fairness and equity for all employees. We work with external experts to conduct pay equity analyses on a regular basis to ensure hourly and salaried employees in the same or similarly situated jobs are paid fairly and equitably for their work, without regard to gender (globally) or race and ethnicity (in the United States). This process gives us confidence that our pay structures are fair and we adjust if disparities arise.
Transparency and Reporting. 
We are committed to increasing transparency and disclosure. We share diversity metrics with senior leaders on a quarterly basis. Starting with this report, we are publicly providing representation data by race3 and gender for our overall workforce and leadership, and including data submitted to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEO-1 survey results), available on our website.
Diverse Representation. 
Our aspiration is to mirror the diversity of the markets we serve and to be 50% led by women globally by 2030. Our Global Women’s Leadership Council (GWLC) aims to support women in leadership positions and grow our pipeline of female talent. In 2020, the council continued a sponsorship program pairing more than 30 senior female associates from around the world with members of the company’s executive leadership team.
We recently announced that, by 2030, our U.S. employee population across all job levels will aspire to align with census data by race and ethnicity.

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion


52 The Coca–Cola Company 2020 Business & ESG Report. 
In June 2020—in the wake of the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis and widespread civil unrest—our company took a hard look at the role we must play in helping end the cycle of systemic racism. Following an employee town hall that generated hundreds of ideas, unfiltered comments and candid questions, Chairman and CEO James Quincey and his leadership team appointed a diverse group of employees representing various functions, ethnicities, generations and perspectives to develop a holistic U.S. Racial Equity Action Plan for the company’s operations in the United States.
“We were empowered right out of the gate,” said Tanika Cabral, Vice President of Customer Leadership, North America Operating Unit, and team co-lead. “We were challenged to think big and to bring to this work an unprecedented degree of nontraditional thinking and energy. We told ourselves from the start that if our plans didn’t scare us a little, then they were not the right plans.”
The team’s approach was grounded in listening and learning, tapping into a cross-cultural, cross-functional network of colleagues, plus stakeholders, partners and leading social advocates. Senior leaders empowered the team to devote significant time to this important work, and an executive steering committee provided weekly input.
Step one was a deep dive into our company’s diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) journey to understand past barriers and missed opportunities. Strategies launched in the early 2000s worked for those times, and notable progress was made in hiring, promotion and compensation practices for Black employees. But over time, progress stalled.
What was missing, the team concluded, was a resolute focus on internal policies and practices. “Disrupting systemic racism and achieving true equity requires first taking a close look at ourselves as an organization,” said Jamal Booker, Strategic Communications Director, Latin America Operating Unit, and team co-lead.
These insights informed five workstreams focused on workplace priorities—from stepping up diversity recruitment efforts to implementing mandatory DEI training—and community advocacy and engagement efforts such as publicly supporting legislation to increase penalties for crimes of prejudice and donating to partner organizations pursuing social justice.
The team pushed boundaries and challenged conventional processes for everything from pay equity analyses to political giving criteria. They brought fresh energy and perspectives, asking tough questions to ultimately generate more ideas and results.
This led to a roadmap built with progress and permanence in mind. Highlights include diverse employee and leadership representation goals to mirror the markets we serve by 2030 and other resources to promote empathy and authentic conversations about race with the goal of creating a more inclusive, equitable workplace.
This work will continue to evolve, and we know we won’t always get everything right. We believe it is vital to continually listen, learn and adapt.
“Our goal,” said Booker, “is to drive the change that will make future Coca-Cola employees—and the world—point back to 2020 as a major turning point.”
Aligns with this UN Sustainability Goal Promoting Racial Equity at Our Company and in Our Communities. 
COCA-COLA RACIAL EQUITY PLAN BY THE NUMBERS $500M earmarked for increasing spending with Black-owned businesses over the next 5 years, more than double the company’s current spend $5.64M in grants, donations and employee matching programs in response to social justice causes from The Coca-Cola Company and The Coca-Cola Foundation throughout 2020 3 STATES where we are advocating for the passage of hate crimes legislation 12 MONTHS to embed diversity, equity and inclusion into our systems and processes 3 CHANNELS for ongoing reporting of our diversity and pay equity data, including our Business & ESG Report, publicly sharing the information we submit to the EEOC, and content posted to our company website coca-colacompany.com of employees will have access to diversity, equity and inclusion curriculum. 100%

Giving Back to Communities. 
The Coca-Cola Foundation is committed to making a difference in communities around the world.
The convergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and urgent calls for social justice in the U.S. and beyond created unprecedented levels of need in 2020. The Coca-Cola Foundation stepped up our charitable giving and donations to respond, contributing $139.1 million— more than in any previous year—to 432 organizations around the world.
The Coca-Cola system donations and independent contributions from The Coca-Cola Foundation total more than $90 million to date to support COVID-19 relief efforts in communities around the world through a combination of product donations, in-kind services and equipment, monetary donations and grants to relief agencies and personal protective equipment, among other initiatives. Learn more on page 6.
Disaster Relief. 
The Coca-Cola Foundation provided more than $5.5 million in immediate relief support to nonprofits in 15 countries impacted by natural disasters in 2020— from forest fires in Australia to typhoons in the Philippines to earthquakes in Turkey—a 60% increase over 2019. The company’s Employee Disaster Relief Fund provided $678,321 to associates impacted by natural disasters and COVID-19—a 695% increase over the previous year.
Promoting Racial Equity. 
Diversity, equity and inclusion are at the heart of our purpose. In 2020, the company created a Global Social Justice Framework grounded in four pillars—listening, leading, investing and advocating—in order to focus our efforts. The Coca-Cola Foundation contributed $4.7 million to 10 leading social justice organizations in the United States, which will use the funds to educate, build understanding and promote change.

Achieving 50% rPET Portfolio in Great Britain and Belgium. 
PET, our highest-volume packaging material, is versatile, lightweight, recyclable and can be made into refillable bottles. We now offer beverages packaged in 100% recycled PET plastic (rPET)1 in around 30 markets. Despite availability and pricing challenges during COVID-19, Coca-Cola Great Britain and Coca-Cola Belgium transitioned their full portfolios to 50% recycled material (up from 25%) by the end of 2020. In the UK alone, this latest milestone means that we are removing more than 21,000 tonnes of new (virgin) plastic per year, although our goal is to go even further.

Delivering Groceries to Consumers. 
COVID-19 lockdowns put tremendous pressure on all retailers, particularly small, independently operated stores in high-density urban areas that depend almost solely on foot traffic. The Wabi app, an online platform created at the initiative of Coca-Cola Argentina, allowed operators to stay open during the pandemic and safely serve customers without having to physically open. When a shopper places an order via a free mobile app, the platform pings nearby retailers. The first store to accept the order delivers the items to the shopper’s doorstep in 30 minutes or less. Wabi is now live in 23 major cities across Latin America, as well as Kenya, Vietnam and Malaysia.

DASANI Recycled Bottle Caps: A New Twist. 
Coca-Cola North America is bringing a new twist to sustainable packaging by using caps made from 30% recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic—a beverage industry first—on DASANI bottles. The breakthrough development won the coveted Plastics News’ 2020 Plastics Caps & Closures Innovation Award as the first beverage closure made from post-consumer recycled content. An initial pilot in California also included a monolayer label for DASANI bottles featuring 40% less plastic than existing labels. The labels separate more easily in the recycling stream, which means bottles can be more easily recycled and used to make new bottles.

Global Ventures Bottling Investments Group • BIG further improved operating margin performance and made progress on cooler productivity and SKU rationalization.
• Almost all markets gained or maintained share, with Vietnam achieving a new record-high sparkling share.
In 2018, we created a new operating segment to house Costa Ltd. (acquisition closed in January 2019), as well as other brands, acquisitions and investments that we believe can be scaled globally. Global Ventures includes Costa coffee, Monster beverages, innocent juices and smoothies, and dogadan tea. The majority of Global Ventures’ revenue consists of Costa coffee and innocent, which together account for approximately 90% of total Global Ventures’ revenue.
In January 2006, our company-owned bottling operations were brought together to form the Bottling Investments Group (BIG) to ensure these operations receive the appropriate investments and expertise to foster long-term success. By strategically investing in select bottling operations and taking them under company ownership, we can utilize the leadership and resources of The Coca-Cola Company to drive longterm growth in critical markets. When an operation is stable and thriving, BIG’s goal is to find a qualified partner to assume operations and continue to invest in and grow the business.
Our current footprint of bottlers exists in South East and South West Asia, parts of Africa and the Middle East. We continue to drive strong performance within BIG while maximizing returns on our investments.

Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures. 
The company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP” or referred to herein as “reported”). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions and in evaluating the company’s performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting.
For additional details regarding the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures below, see the company’s Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on Feb. 10, 2021, Jan. 30, 2020 and Feb. 14, 2019.

The Coca-Cola Company Coca-Cola System 1 The calculation of progress toward our “drink in your hand” goal has been internally vetted using accepted and relevant scientific and technical methodologies, which are aligned with GHG Protocol Scopes 1, 2 and 3. Due to the nature of our franchise bottling system, our manufacturing emissions are normally split between Scopes 1 and 2 for company-owned facilities and Scope 3 for bottling partner facilities. However, in our “drink in your hand” calculations, we consider the full Coca-Cola system (including franchise bottling partners) in the calculation of our manufacturing, distribution and refrigeration emissions.
2 This number includes charitable grants awarded by The Coca-Cola Foundation and donations made by The Coca-Cola Company.
3 This percentage was calculated excluding Bottling Investments.

Data Appendix 2020 Sustainability Goals


The Coca-Cola Company Coca-Cola System 1 Our method to track our packaging collection rate against our 2020 goal focused on our predominant package types (glass bottles, steel and aluminum cans and PET plastic bottles). Because of new data that we have available to us, our collection rate against our World Without Waste goals takes into account a more inclusive collection rate, representing all of our consumer packaging—including beverage cartons, juice boxes and pouches, etc.
2 This is the focused scope of Primary Consumer Packaging (PET, Glass, Cans, Cartons).
3 In 2019, we modified the methodology we use for calculating the amount of recycled material used in our Primary Consumer Packaging. These changes are designed to integrate a more accurate dataset, including primary data where it is available. Moving forward, we expect that these numbers will continue to evolve as data sources improve, at the same time that we work to increase rates of recycled material use.
4 Our percentage calculations of progress toward collection of 100% of the equivalent of the consumer packaging we sell has been internally vetted using relevant scientific and technical methodologies. This collection measure has been replaced by a more expansive collection measure (as noted in footnote 1).
5 We are continuously improving the quality of our data by reviewing our sources and introducing more precise processes and methodologies. Based on a review of 2019 data, we are revising the percentage of our rPET usage from 9.7% to 9.4%. Our 2020 World Without Waste metrics are currently under review by our assurance provider.
6 This result is preliminary and final numbers will be reported in the 2020 World Without Waste report.

In 2020, we improved our approach to calculating representation data, rendering year-over-year comparison less meaningful at this time. This data excludes fairlife employees.
2 In 2019, Employee Relations redefined how cases were captured in the case management tool of record. Therefore, the reported figure includes only those allegations that required investigations only as opposed to generalized questions raised to Employee Relations. Please note, however, that all questions presented to Employee Relations were answered even if the question did not warrant an investigation. While we previously reported on all cases and questions raised through our case management tool, we no longer capture that data. This helps us to ensure that we have more accurate visibility to annual Human Rights cases. This change accounts for the 2019 variance when compared to previous years.

The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)
The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
The United Nations Global Compact (UNGC)
The United Nations Guiding Principles Reporting Framework (UNGPRF)
GRI provides a globally recognized framework for companies to measure and communicate their environmental, economic, social and governance performance. We prepared this report in accordance with the 2016 GRI Standards: Core option. This is the tenth consecutive year that these reporting principles have informed our reporting process, and we assess our progress against these guidelines. In this report, the GRI General Disclosures are solely for The Coca-Cola Company. For all other indicators, the scope is identified in the referenced documents. Beyond reporting on performance indicators required by the GRI, we report on additional indicators important to our broad range of stakeholders.
This report also meets the requirements of the UNGC Advanced Communication on Progress and aligns with the UNGPRF, which addresses reporting on human rights.
We review our reporting regularly and aim to be as responsive as possible to our stakeholders’ feedback.
