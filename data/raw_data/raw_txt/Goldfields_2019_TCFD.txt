ABOUT THIS REPORT. 
This is our second Climate Change Report compiled in line with the recommendations of the Financial Services Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). It is released as a companion to our 2019 Integrated Annual Report (IAR).
In 2018, Gold Fields became only the second South African company and the first South African mining company to publicly endorse the TCFD recommendations. The TCFD recommendations are backed by most financial regulators around the world and encourage companies to release details about their climate-related financial risks and opportunities to provide consistent information to investors, lenders, insurers, and other stakeholders. Our TCFD report replaced our previous annual submissions under the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).
The TCFD voluntary guidelines provide for strategic, comparable and reliable disclosure of climate-related information, which companies commit to publish at least once a year. The scope of our climate change performance and data covers our eight managed mines (including 100% of the new Gruyere mine, but excluding our Asanko Gold JV). While we report on relevant developments at our Salares Norte project in Chile, we do not include data from the project.

Understanding the risks and adapting to climate change. 
The long-term risks posed by climate change to the Group’s operations, projects and surrounding communities could impact our ability to operate our mines sustainability as they are set to increase both operational and capital costs. At the same time though, opportunities have also emerged through improved water and energy consumption efficiencies and transitioning towards lower carbon energy sources, with associated financial benefits. Unless managed appropriately, the negative impacts of climate change could create resource tensions with host communities, thus affecting our social licence to operate.
The processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks are integrated into Gold Fields’ risk management systems. These risks and mitigating actions are integrated into business strategy – from planning through to operations.
Business planning includes consideration of the following risks: water availability, shifts in rainfall patterns, higher temperatures, changing legislative landscapes pertaining to carbon emissions management, the increasing need to find alternatives to traditional energy provision, and improved energy and water efficiencies. Our regional offices monitor regulatory changes, including climate change-related ones. We have also included climate-related risk assessments in our capital projects studies.
At an operational level, Gold Fields completes detailed operation-specific climate risk vulnerability assessments every five years (since 2016). In addition, operations review site-level climate-related risks on a quarterly basis.
Climate change-related risks are reflected in our top 20 risks either directly, through flooding and droughts and increased energy consumption, or, indirectly, through their impact on water supply and costs as well as regulatory changes. Water risks have been identified over the short, medium and long term, particularly at our operations in South Africa, Peru and Australia, which the World Business Council for Sustainable Development classifies as water-stressed.
Gold Fields’ processes are aligned to the ICMM’s Sustainable Development framework.
In addition, we have signed up to a number of global initiatives and programmes that support both corporate disclosure of climate change impacts and encourage multi-stakeholder commitments to combatting it.
It is increasingly clear that the negative impacts of climate change are real and immediate, due to: • The physical impacts of climate change on the Group’s operations and surrounding communities • Increasing regulation and policy changes around carbon emissions • Direct and indirect carbon taxes and levies imposed by governments to disincentivise non-renewable energy consumption • Growing interest by investors to understand the impacts of climate change on their portfolios. 
Our climate change programme objectives are to improve preparedness and build operational resilience to climate-related risks, reduce the use of natural resources and improve climate reporting and disclosure.
We aim to achieve these objectives by: • Continuously reviewing and refining our understanding of climate-related risks and opportunities • Assessing climate-related risks through project delivery studies and operational risk assessments • Integrating energy, water, and carbon emissions management plans into our business strategic planning • Improving efficiencies in the use of natural resources (energy and water) • Harnessing innovation and technology to reduce our carbon footprint while managing regulatory risks. 
As such, Gold Fields’ climate change programme is focused on a comprehensive assessment of climate change-related risks and mitigation opportunities, as well as the development and implementation of action plans.
At operational level our integrated energy, carbon management and water strategies highlight the approach taken by our mines to achieve: • Greater energy and water efficiencies • Increased use of low carbon and renewable energy sources • Security of water and energy supplies • Responsible management of our water resources. 
The impact of this has been to achieve greater energy and water security, lower energy intensity and reduced carbon emissions.
Our next steps Improving performance: As we strive to improve our water, energy and carbon emissions performance, we will be conducting studies for strategic interventions.
Risk assessments: During 2021, we will be updating our regional vulnerability and site risk assessments to inform our next five-year mitigation and adaptation plans, and integrating them with our business strategies.
Planning: Using assessments, we will be aiming to further improve our integration of climate change considerations into operational management.
Stakeholder engagements: We will seek to include climaterelated challenges and developments into our key stakeholder engagements to discuss the impact of climate-related risks.
Gold Fields’ commitment to leadership in sustainable gold mining underlies everything we do as a business. As such, we are committed to addressing one of the defining global challenges society is facing, namely the impact of the rapidly changing climate on our business, our employees and host communities.
We continue to respond to this challenge through a range of strategic policy interventions as well as operational adjustments. The management of climate change impacts and our transition to a low carbon environment is a key component of environmental stewardship at all our operations and projects. Compared to other metals, such as steel, coal or aluminium, gold mining’s carbon emission intensity per unit value is among the lowest in the sector. As a mining business, Gold Fields is fully cognisant of the fact that we have a material impact on the surrounding environment and the communities with whom we share this environment.
Our carbon emissions are primarily from diesel consumed by haulage trucks and electricity consumption in mining and gold processing.
Internally, Gold Fields has recently reviewed and updated a number of policy statements and guidelines, reflecting our environmental priorities. They cover the following areas of responsibility in the Company: energy and carbon management; environmental management; water management; tailings management and mine closure.
In 2017 the Board approved a Climate Change Policy Statement, committing us to identify and assess climate-related risks and opportunities; report and disclose our performance via various reporting frameworks; raise the proportion of renewable energy; and implement energy and water efficiency initiatives.

OUR CLIMATE CHANGE COMMITMENTS 2019 ICMM Position Statement on Climate Change. 
Recognition statements. 
ICMM members recognise: 1. The need for an urgent global response to the threat of climate change, across all areas of society and the economy.
2. The need to support the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit the increase in the global average temperature to 2°C and pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C.
3. The need to reduce emissions from the extraction and use of mining products, and support collaborative market-based approaches to accelerate the use of low-emission technologies as part of a transition to a low carbon energy mix. At the same time, we also recognise the practical challenges that some less developed countries with domestic supplies of fossil fuels will face in making that transition.
4. That climate and energy policy should be technology neutral and rely on market-based approaches to enable least cost abatement solutions.
5. The vital role that a broad-based, predictable, long-term carbon pricing can play, alongside other market mechanisms to drive reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and incentivise innovation.
6. The importance of providing climate-related disclosure in order for all stakeholders to measure and respond to climate change risks and opportunities, including the transparency around climate-related risks the TCFD has brought.
7. The role of natural climate solutions and offsets in providing low cost options to address global greenhouse gas emissions.
Commitments. 
In addition to existing commitments under the ICMM Sustainable Development Framework, ICMM member companies commit to being part of the solution by:
Individually: • Implement governance, engagement and disclosure processes to ensure climate change risks and opportunities are considered in business decision-making.
• Advance operational level adaptation and mitigation solutions, taking in consideration local opportunities and challenges.
• Engage with host communities on our shared climate change risks and opportunities and help host communities understand how they can adapt to the physical impact of climate change.
• Disclose scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions on an annual basis and set emissions reduction targets at a corporate level.
Collectively: • Support the global transition to a low carbon economy by continuing to contribute to the sustainable production of commodities essential to the energy and mobility transition, working with our partners and key suppliers along our value chains.
• Engage with external parties to determine a preferred approach to reporting scope 3 emissions.

Our governance processes around climate-related risks. 
Oversight over climate change-related strategy, performance and risks is held at Board level. The Board sets the strategic direction and approves policies that are relevant to the management of energy, carbon emissions, water and climate change.
The Gold Fields Board’s Risk Committee provides oversight on Group risks. The Committee undertakes and reviews company-wide risk assessments twice a year, with a view to ensuring effective and robust risk management strategies are in place.
The Safety, Health and Sustainable Development (SHSD) Committee of the Board reviews performance against climate-related strategies on a quarterly basis.
The Capital Projects, Control and Review Committee is responsible for capital allocation. Project deliverables include assessment of climate risks and opportunities.
At Group level, Gold Fields’ executive management is tasked with implementing Board-approved policies and strategies as well as related risk management plans. Quarterly updates on these issues are provided to the SHSD Committee of the Board, while the Risk Committee reviews updates to the risk register.
Permanent appointments at Group level of a Head of Water, Environmental Manager, and Head of Energy and Carbon provide central coordination through to Group executive management and the Board. A number of Group-wide teams from the regions and operations, led by corporate, collaborate to enhance management of water, carbon emissions, environment, energy and climate change-related risks.
Climate-relate risks are identified and ranked in accordance with Gold Fields’ Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) process, which is aligned with the ISO 31000 global risk management standard. At regional level, strategic and operational risk registers include contingencies for climate events such as floods, droughts, severe storms and regulatory changes.

We have noted an increase in climate-related legislation, policies and litigations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. A snapshot across our host regions as at December 2019 is indicated in the map below:
MONITORING NATIONALLY DETERMINED COMMITMENTS (NDC) Gold Fields uses the NDC scenarios to ensure close alignment of our strategies with those of the relevant national programmes and policies to address climate change. The parameters (and timeframes) used in these scenario analyses are geographically tailored to include the commitments of the various countries in which Gold Fields operates.
The NDC analyses are also considered across all business areas such as mining, processing and logistics. The outcomes of the scenario analyses have informed Gold Fields’ business plans and budget allocations. Gold Fields recognises that energy markets have been fundamentally redefined by the global drive to minimise contributions and build resilience to climate change. This has affected the types of energy sourced by business, the cost of energy, how energy is procured and how energy is utilised.

KtCO2-e. 
Our Energy and Carbon management strategy drives energy efficiency initiatives and use of low-carbon energy, both to achieve cost savings but also to reduce our emissions. Between 2013 and 2019, Gold Fields realised cumulative energy savings of 2,090TJ, nearly 3% of energy consumption over this period, equivalent to US$119m in cost savings and avoiding 474,000 tonnes CO2-e in scope 1 and scope 2 carbon emissions, equivalent to 7% of carbon emissions during this period.
Our strategic initiatives include: • Fuel switching to low-carbon energy sources • Assessing and installing renewable energy options • Re-negotiating energy contracts with suppliers • Investing in energy efficiency initiatives • Aligning our guidelines and certifying our operations to the ISO 50001 energy management system. 
In 2017, we set the following aspirational energy and carbon emissions reductions targets for the period 2017 to 2020: • Cumulative scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions reductions by 800,000t CO2-e, against projected annual carbon emissions; by end 2019, we had achieved nearly 50% of this target, with significant reductions expected in 2020 from our renewable energy projects in Australia • 5% to 10% energy savings per year through investments in energy initiatives. Each year we have performed mostly in line with these targets • Alignment with ISO 50001 energy management principles at all our operations. The Cerro Corona mine achieved certification in 2018, and Tarkwa and Damang in March 2020. Our other mines are currently conducting gap analyses with the aim of achieving certification by 2023 at the latest. 
Gold Fields’ energy spending combines our electricity and fuel spend and is the second largest cost item in the Group after human resources. In 2019, total energy spend was US$300m, equivalent to approximately US$134/oz, comprising 20% of operating costs.
The graph below shows Group energy consumption by source and the related carbon emissions by scope type are detailed in the adjacent graphs.

Following are profiles of our three key renewable energy initiatives: • At Agnew, we commissioned a 10,000 panel solar photovoltaic plant, generating 4MW of power (on sunny days reaching up to 25% of mining demand). By December 2019, Agnew had 8% of its electricity demand met by the solar farm to complement power from its gas plant. An 18MW wind farm (made up of five 3.75MW wind turbines) and a 13MW/4MWh battery energy storage system are coming online from March 2020 onwards. This A$112m project was supported by A$13m from the Australian government’s renewable fund to enable the wind and battery systems. The Agnew micro-grid will reduce our carbon footprint by some 45,000t CO2-e per year • At Granny Smith, in 2016, we commissioned a 24MW gas power plant, to replace a diesel power plant; and in 2019 added a 20,000 panel 8MW solar farm with 2MW battery energy storage system facility, which was commissioned in March 2020. The Granny Smith mine solar power plant will reduce our carbon footprint by some 10,000t CO2-e per year • Following our public commitment to have at least 20% renewable energy in all new mines, we completed evaluations at our recently approved Salares Norte project in Chile, located in the Atacama desert. We are planning to ramp up by 2023 with 15% of electricity supplied by a solar power plant, with future energy studies to be undertaken to increase this level. 
Tracking our performance – renewable energy. 
In our quest to strengthen security of supply and decarbonise our energy sources, while at the same time creating resilience against oil price volatility, we have started incorporating renewable energy into our energy supply mix. Two of our Australian mines, Agnew and Granny Smith, have installed renewables and storage solutions. In 2019 renewables accounted for 1% of our Australian mines and less than 1% of our Group energy consumption. By the end of 2020, we project that renewable energy will account for approximately 10% of the total energy usage in our Australian region and 2% of Group consumption.
Our other mines around the world are also looking at raising the renewable energy portion of their energy consumption. The South Deep mine in South Africa is preparing to develop a 40MW solar plant, pending regulatory approval, while our mines in Ghana are investigating the feasibility of renewable energy supplies in line with legislation expected in the near future.
Tracking our performance – water stewardship. 
Three of the regions in which we operate, South Africa, Australia and Peru, are considered water stressed. Climate change impacts our operations and communities in a number of ways – severe rainfall, shifts in rainfall patterns and prolonged droughts, among others – and responsible and effective water management is increasingly critical to Gold Fields.
Not only will water scarcity or excessive rainfall adversely impact operations, as water is a vital resource for our mining and ore processing activities, it is also an essential need for our host communities – particularly where agriculture is an important economic activity. Managing our impacts on water catchment areas – by ensuring that we do not denude the quality of water or reduce the volume thereof – and is therefore key to maintaining our social licence to operate.
In early 2020, we finalised our 2020 – 2025 Group water stewardship strategy, which includes regional water strategies and threeyear management plans, many of them taking cognisance of the impact of climate change. The strategy has three objectives: • To be a water efficient operator, which requires that we reduce our demand for freshwater from the catchment areas as much as possible due to the probability of water supply shortfalls and communities’ water requirements. • To apply a proactive and risk-based approach to water management. As such, we are embedding water planning into core operational management, empowering informed management decisions and aligning water risks with resourcing over the life of our operations. • To work with stakeholders in the catchment areas around our mines so that collaborative water actions can be identified and realised. These approaches will be different in each region. The diagram illustrates our long-term strategy:
WATER EFFICIENT OPERATOR Low-water risk operation • Cost efficiency (3% to 5% fresh water reduction) • Recycling and reuse of water (66%) • Decrease fresh water withdrawal. 
OBJECTIVES. 
REGIONS PILLARS }5-year regional water strategies }3-year water management plans. 
PROACTIVE OPERATOR Risk-based water integration • Proactive water management • Minimised legal/risk exposure • Effective water system. 
FACILITATING STAKEHOLDER Shared catchment area approach • Transparent communicator • Facilitated partnerships • Shared value programmes. 
In the short-term, the water management strategic objectives for 2020 comprise: • Maintaining security of supply • Effectively managing water at our operations • Applying transparent corporate water governance • Adopting a catchment approach to water management. 
During 2019, Gold Fields spent US$27m on water management by investing in methods to improve our water management practices, including pollution prevention, recycling and water conservation initiatives.
Predictive and dynamic water balances are in place at all operations, enabling us to account for water inputs and outputs. Furthermore, we have set a target to recycle or reuse at least 66% of the water we use in our processes. In 2019, we achieved 68%.
