SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. 
APPENDIX 2020 was a year of unprecedented challenges, as COVID-19 created a public health and economic crisis, families and businesses struggled to cope, and racism and injustice spurred social unrest.
It was a year that brought into sharper focus both the importance of our mission and the positive difference we can make in this world beyond the essential service we provide.
Looking back, I am tremendously proud of how PPL responded. Across our company, our employees rallied to keep each other safe and stay connected, to keep power and gas flowing to the families and businesses counting on us each day, and to do our part to assist our customers and communities through these trying times.
We did so grounded in the values that have sustained us for a century and guided by our long-term strategy, which seeks to create value for all stakeholders by: • Achieving industry-leading performance in safety, reliability, customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
• Advancing a clean energy transition while maintaining affordability and reliability.
• Maintaining a strong financial foundation and creating long-term value for shareowners.
• Fostering a diverse and exceptional workplace.
• Building strong communities.
Our accomplishments in 2020 included: • Providing electricity and gas safely and reliably to more than 10 million customers.
• Achieving award-winning customer satisfaction in each of the regions we serve.
• Investing $3 billion to improve grid resilience and advance a sustainable energy future.
• Adding more than 90 megawatts of new solar generation.
• Maintaining our strong financial position to weather COVID-19 economic impact.
• Contributing more than $12 million to support our communities, including more than $2 million in COVID-19 relief.
In addition to these achievements, our progress over the past year included taking further steps to advance diversity, equity and inclusion.
Toward that end, we adopted an enterprise-wide diversity, equity and inclusion strategy and commitments. We held focused discussions on race and social justice that will inform our efforts moving forward. PPL Foundation expanded its mission to support racial justice and equity initiatives more directly. And we continued to engage with community coalitions focused on race and equity issues.
Lastly, understanding the opportunity we have to shape our shared energy future, we continued in 2020 to advance a multi-pronged clean energy strategy to reduce our carbon emissions, support increased electrification, enable large-scale connection of distributed energy resources, and advance research and development into clean energy solutions.
This included establishing a more aggressive carbon reduction goal of at least 80% from 2010 levels by 2050, adopting goals to electrify our fleet vehicles, and joining a five-year industry initiative to accelerate development of clean energy technologies that can help us go even further faster than the goals we have set. Our recently announced agreements to sell our U.K. utility company, Western Power Distribution, and acquire Rhode Island’s largest electric and gas utility, provide us greater financial flexibility to invest in sustainable energy solutions.
Additional 2020 highlights and details regarding important corporate sustainability work taking place across PPL can be found throughout this report.
In closing, I am very proud of the resolve and resilience that we have displayed over the past year. Our employees have come together to face change and challenge, and I truly believe it has made us even stronger as a company. As we look ahead, we are excited about the opportunities we have to move energy forward, make a difference in our customers’ lives, and create long-term value for our shareowners.
We welcome your feedback and appreciate your interest in PPL.
Sincerely,
Vincent Sorgi, President and Chief Executive Officer.

SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL AND REGULATORY HIGHLIGHTS DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. 
Vincent Sorgi became president and chief executive officer of PPL Corporation on June 1, 2020 with the retirement of William H. Spence. Sorgi, who has over 25 years of experience in the utility industry, served as PPL's chief operating officer since June 2014. As part of the leadership change, Spence assumed the role of non-executive chair of the Board, a position he held until his retirement from the Board of Directors in March 2021. Effective on March 1, 2021, Craig A. Rogerson became the independent chair of the Board.
PPL initiated the formal process to sell Western Power Distribution, its U.K. utility business, in order to position PPL as a purely U.S.-focused energy company and create additional shareowner value. The decision to proceed with the sale process followed a comprehensive strategic review by PPL's Board of Directors that assessed the company's business mix and future growth opportunities.This resulted in a March 18, 2021, announcement of agreements to sell WPD to National Grid for £7.8 billion and acquire National Grid’s Rhode Island electric and gas utility for $3.8 billion.
WPD published the first version of its RIIO-ED2 Business Plan in January 2020, outlining 67 core commitments to ensure it meets the needs of its customers, delivers an environmentally sustainable service and maintains a safe and resilient network.
LG&E and KU filed for approval from the Kentucky Public Service Commission in November 2020 to adjust their cost-based rates, to cover significant upgrades to the utilities’ infrastructure and escalating costs of business operations.
The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission in October 2020 approved PPL Electric’s petition to conduct a pilot program to examine active management of customer-sited distributed energy resources such as rooftop solar and battery storage.

SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY APPENDIX. 
Strong leadership and well-managed operations are the cornerstones of a successful business. PPL’s corporate governance practices are designed to ensure long-term value for our shareowners, customers and the communities in which we operate.
The Board of Directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the management of PPL, selecting the company’s leaders, approving long-range strategic plans and advising senior management.
The board has designated its Governance and Nominating Committee as the body responsible for overseeing PPL’s sustainability strategy, and its environmental, social and governance practices and positions.
Committed to diversity, the Governance and Nominating Committee considers skills, expertise, background, professional experience, education and other individual characteristics, as well as a variety of attributes that contribute to the board’s collective strength. To reflect its commitment to diversity, the pool of candidates from which the Governance and Nominating Committee recommends nominees will include qualified persons who reflect diverse backgrounds, including diversity of gender, and race or ethnicity, and if any third-party search firm is used, it will be specifically instructed to include such candidates. Two of the board’s four independent committees are led by women.
Additional details about the role of the board, independence of the directors, role of the independent directors, the independent chair of the board and selection of directors can be found in the Guidelines for Corporate Governance.
RESPONSIBLE COMPENSATION. 
The board is committed to responsible compensation programs that support the company’s strategy, culture and values over the long term. Incentive compensation is based on performance against financial and operational goals set by the Board of Directors. Each year, the board and executive management team evaluate the company’s strategy and refine performance goals and priorities to help ensure long-term benefit to our shareowners.
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. 
The board believes that to continue to attract talent to the board, outside directors should be remunerated for their services at a level competitive with that provided by other comparable publicly-traded corporations. Directors who are company employees (currently only PPL’s chief executive officer) do not receive any separate compensation for service on the board of directors or its committees. Information regarding compensation of PPL’s directors can be found in the 2021 Proxy Statement, beginning on Page 21.
2020 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. 
Information regarding PPL’s executive compensation program and compensation philosophy and objectives, as well as a discussion of how executive compensation decisions affecting our named executive officers were made for 2020, are included in the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” section of the 2021 Proxy Statement. Additional details about specific compensation of the named executive officers are included in the 2021 Proxy Statement, beginning on Page 62.

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT. 
PPL maintains a robust enterprise risk management process that provides a business portfolio view of material risks that may impact achievement of PPL’s business strategy. As part of the enterprise risk management process, representatives from PPL’s operating companies and service groups identify, assess, monitor and report on ongoing and emerging risks, including climate-related and broader environmental, social and governance risks. The company’s Risk Management group oversees this process and reports quarterly to the Audit Committee.
BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND CRISIS RESPONSE PLANNING. 
PPL has a Corporate Crisis Plan to ensure the company is prepared to respond quickly in the event of a corporate-level crisis; to protect the public, environment, employees, facilities and operations; to mitigate impacts; to define roles for response and recovery; and to establish internal and external communications protocols.
The plan establishes the PPL Executive Crisis Team, which sets policy, directs crisis preparedness by the company’s various business lines and operations, assesses and directs the provision of corporate-level resources and coordinates activities with regional company locations in the event of a major crisis.
The standing members of the Executive Crisis Team are the president and chief executive officer; the general counsel; the chief financial officer; the vice president-Public Affairs and Sustainability; the senior director- Corporate Communications; and the director-Protective Services and chief physical security officer. Additional members can be added to the Executive Crisis Team as needed, depending on the situation. If the crisis involves operations, the team would typically include the business line president whose operating company is involved.
The team maintains various crisis planning scenarios and robust notification tools and procedures. In addition, it conducts periodic plan exercises, refining protocols after each event.

APPENDIX. 
To fulfill our obligation to shareowners and all others who have a stake in PPL’s business and the communities we serve, we (and our contractors) must adhere to high ethical standards, work safely and responsibly, and comply with both the spirit and the letter of all laws and regulations that govern our business. We recognize that to do otherwise would be costly to our company — not just financially, but also in terms of the strong reputation built by generations of PPL employees.
PPL has established a compliance and ethics program that is founded upon PPL’s Standards of Integrity. The Standards of Integrity, along with our Vision and Values, define the way that we conduct our business. They apply in all situations, at all times, guiding the decisions we make and the actions we take.

VICE PRESIDENT AND GLOBAL CHIEF COMPLIANCE OFFICER Has overall responsibility for PPL’s compliance and ethics program and chairs the Corporate Compliance Committee.
CORPORATE COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE Serves as an integral part of PPL’s enterprise-wide compliance and ethics governance structure and a key component of the compliance and ethics program.

APPENDIX. 
WORKING WITH INTEGRITY. 
PPL is committed to strong governance practices and high ethical standards. Directors and all PPL officers are always expected to act ethically and adhere to the policies set forth in the Standards of Integrity. Every member of the Board of Directors receives a copy of the Standards of Integrity. It is the responsibility of each director to advise the corporate secretary of any actual or potential conflict of interest, and any affiliation with public or privately-held enterprises, including for-profit and nonprofit entities that may create a potential conflict of interest to the company or inconsistency with applicable laws, company policies or values.
Every employee is expected to read, understand and comply with the Standards of Integrity and associated company policies. In addition, employees are expected to report any compliance or ethics concerns to their immediate supervisors or via another appropriate reporting mechanism, including anonymous reporting mechanisms that are in place and publicized to employees. PPL takes any instance of noncompliance seriously. Failure to obey laws and regulations or violations of company policies may result in employee discipline to the extent permissible under applicable law, up to and including termination.
Employees receive annual training on the Standards of Integrity. As part of the training, every employee is required to certify that they understand the expectation to report misconduct and understand that PPL will not tolerate any form of retaliation for any report made in good faith. All training is tracked, recorded and reported to executive leadership and the Audit Committee. Targeted communications on key compliance and ethics topics are also issued as needed.
REPORTING AND HANDLING OF VIOLATIONS. 
Employees are expected to ask questions or raise concerns about the application or interpretation of the Standards of Integrity.
The company does not discriminate against or tolerate any form of retaliation toward employees who ask questions or raise concerns in good faith, and provides an “EthicsHelpline” for confidential and, if desired, anonymous reporting of concerns. PPL’s EthicsHelpline toll-free phone number and internet site are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The EthicsHelpline, which is managed by an external vendor to promote confidence in confidentiality, is also accessible on the internet. In addition to employees, suppliers, customers and other external parties can use the EthicsHelpline to report concerns.
Guidelines are in place for promptly responding to allegations of misconduct and include notifying the vice president and global chief compliance officer of the allegations. Issues and trends are identified and reported to the Audit Committee. Allegations are handled and reported to the Audit Committee each quarter, with the most serious allegations being reported on an expedited basis to the chair of the Audit Committee as soon as reasonably practicable after initial intake discussions.

As the threats to our business and energy infrastructure evolve, our strategies and approaches for how we respond to those threats also continue to evolve.
A reliable power grid requires resiliency. We have made — and continue to make — significant investments in people, processes and technology to strengthen our security protections and enhance grid reliability and resiliency.
We continually assess the risk landscape and improve our understanding of potential threats, motivations and techniques. Using this knowledge, we layer on physical and cyber protections to further reduce risk, increase resiliency and maintain the integrity of our systems.
CYBERSECURITY IN ACTION. 
Recent system compromises of numerous government agencies and private industry companies provide a good case study of the challenges we continuously face as we implement PPL’s cybersecurity strategy.
Managing cybersecurity risks with our third-party vendors remains an area of focus for PPL’s teams and is one of many areas that requires vigilance throughout the entire enterprise.
Additional security measures include frequent meetings with the cyber operations teams in each operating company to share intelligence, assess exposure and form response plans; evaluating software and information technology management tools to ensure security and compliance; and continuously monitoring cyber intelligence, government agency guidance, best practices and industry lessons learned.
PHYSICAL RESILIENCY. 
Crisis management plans are also critical to resiliency and timely restoration. Testing those plans is essential. PPL conducts a variety of exercises and drills, spanning both U.S. and U.K. operations, to help test our incident protocols and critical functions, and identify areas for improvement.
PPL will continue to make investments in new power lines, substations and smart technologies to help strengthen the power grid and make it more resistant to security threats.

LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY PRIORITIES. 
In 2020, these were PPL’s top U.S. and U.K. public policy issues:
SECURITY AND SAFETY • Physical and cybersecurity – Policymakers continually assess and examine the reliability and security of the bulk power system from both a physical security and cybersecurity perspective. The electricity sector is one of the only critical infrastructure sectors, with mandatory and enforceable federal cybersecurity and reliability standards. These standards were developed through the North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s standards- setting process. Grid owners and operators are involved in developing these standards, which must be approved by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
• Spectrum availability (6 GHz) – In April 2020, the Federal Communications Commission approved new rules opening up the 6 GHz spectrum band to unlicensed users. The 6 GHz band is currently used by 65 utilities across the country, for critical infrastructure operations. PPL and other incumbent operators and owners of critical infrastructure continue to have concerns about the potential for unlicensed devices to interfere with mission-critical communications, which could threaten system reliability. Incumbent users expect the Federal Communications Commission to ensure interference mitigation technologies are rigorously tested and found to be effective in order to protect the electric power system.
• Pipeline safety – PPL supports pipeline safety and has proactively taken steps to replace aging gas pipelines with new, more durable materials. Authorization for the federal pipeline safety program was administered by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration but expired on Sept. 30, 2019. Throughout 2020, the company supported reauthorization proposals that sought to ensure pipeline safety while considering the costs and benefits to the customer. With passage of the PIPES Act in December 2020, Congress reauthorized federal pipeline safety programs through 2023, and PPL will work with the administration as it promulgates rules to implement the legislation.
• Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program – PPL supports the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program and works with federal policymakers to secure adequate funding for this important program, which provides assistance for our most vulnerable customers during the winter heating season. The importance of this program was magnified by the economic hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
• Unmanned aircraft systems – PPL was one of the first utilities in the country to incorporate unmanned aircraft systems into company operations, and the company continues to work with policymakers to broaden the ways in which we can safely and reliably use the technology for the benefit of our employees and customers. The Federal Aviation Administration most recently updated its regulation of small, unmanned aircraft systems by issuing a final rule in December 2020 that allows nighttime operations and flights over people for systems equipped with appropriate safety technology. Restrictions remain on “beyond visual line of sight operations,” which would unlock many potential uses, including the routine inspection of critical energy infrastructure. PPL is also working to ensure sensible regulations are coordinated at all levels of government to allow for the consistent use of the technology across jurisdictions and municipal boundaries.

APPENDIX. 
CLIMATE-RELATED POLICY AND GRID MODERNIZATION • Carbon emissions legislation and regulations – In Pennsylvania, PPL is monitoring regulatory efforts to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, with a focus on potential utility customer impacts and use of proceeds. At the federal level, PPL is supporting efforts to strengthen research and development of clean energy and carbon removal technologies. Should Congress act on climate legislation, PPL believes such legislation should be economy-wide, market-based, and provide for regional flexibility. PPL also supports a federal carbon rule that is based on “inside the fence” or unit-specific reductions that are demonstrated to be available.
• Adaptation and grid resilience – The resilience of the power grid is a growing issue of policy focus due to the critical importance of the energy sector for national and economic security. PPL supports policies that value robust transmission and reliable energy supply and preserve flexibility of local solutions to optimize utilities’ own resource portfolios. The company also advocates for policies that support grid modernization, including the integration of distributed energy resources and more efficient use of existing grid assets.
• Federal infrastructure permitting – PPL supports federal legislation that creates a more efficient and predictable permitting process for large infrastructure projects and a more transparent and accountable regulatory system that promotes economic development while maintaining necessary safety, environmental and public health protections.
• Distribution System Operator transition – The U.K. government and Ofgem have encouraged distribution network operators to transition to distribution system operators to actively manage the energy system to support the U.K.’s transition to a low-carbon economy, with increasing energy resources connecting directly to the distribution network, including generation and electric vehicles. WPD has engaged stakeholders throughout the planning process, publishing a Distribution System Operator Forward Plan that outlines the company’s transition strategy and ongoing project developments.
• Investment tax credit for energy storage – PPL supports efforts to provide the same investment tax credits for energy storage as is currently available for solar and other technologies.
• Net metering – PPL supports the development of private distributed energy resources with a compensation structure that is fair to all customers.
UTILITY REGULATION • Service termination moratorium – PPL's domestic utilities suspended terminations and late payments for customers, and later supported the lifting of the service termination moratoriums put in place by the state public utility commissions during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic, provided that adequate consumer protections and customer assistance programs were put in place. PPL opposes proposals at the federal level to impose a blanket federal moratorium on utilities and supports its state commissions’ view that this authority is best left to individual states. In the U.K., WPD is working with Ofgem and its suppliers to ensure that suppliers could remain financially able to serve customer supply without interruption.
• RIIO-ED2 – U.K. regulator Ofgem sought feedback through a consultation process to establish the RIIO-ED2 framework and methodology. This regulatory framework will outline the high-level issues for determining the price controls for the next five-year regulatory period, running from 2023-2028. WPD provided input to Ofgem through the consultation process, taking into account stakeholder feedback.
• Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act – The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has proposed to modernize its 40-year old Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act regulations, focusing on providing more flexibility to state regulatory authorities, streamlining and closing loopholes. PPL supports efforts to update the act, particularly FERC's proposal to better align rates paid to a qualifying facility with actual utility avoided costs.
• Pole attachments – Federal and state regulators continue to examine at what cost and in what manner telecommunication companies and other entities may attach their equipment to poles owned by utilities. PPL advocates that any new rules ensure that attachers operate in a safe manner, do not unfairly shift costs to utility customers and do not negatively impact electric service reliability.

RELIABILITY AND RESILIENCY. 
Whether lighting the essential work of hospitals treating a surge of COVID-19 pandemic patients or powering the home computers we all came to depend on for schooling and work, the critical work of keeping the power flowing took on even greater meaning in 2020.
PPL’s utilities work continuously to monitor, maintain and enhance the reliability and resiliency of the transformers, power lines, substations and other equipment used to transport electricity to customers.
PPL’s utilities continue to use technology to work smartly and more efficiently, whether it’s using big data to help drive improvements or studying how best to approach the growing appetite for distributed energy resources like solar.
We continue to invest in our networks to make our already strong reliability record even better. Projects over the next several years to modernize and strengthen the grid include: • Replacing aging system equipment.
• Installing smart grid technology.
• Constructing new lines and substations.
• Rebuilding existing lines with stronger poles and wires.
• Line clearing and vegetation management.
• Installing devices to guard against damage from lightning and animals.
• Assessing flood risks at critical facilities, such as substations and power plants, and installing defenses where necessary.

IN 2020, HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDE: • PPL Electric reached a major milestone, recording its 1 millionth avoided outage since 2015 due to its smart grid. The company’s investment in automation, including the installation of over 7,000 smart devices, allows its smart grid to both recognize an outage and instantly reroute power to reduce the footprint of the outage.
• PPL Electric improved vegetation-related customer reliability by 11% compared to the same period in the previous year.
• LG&E and KU continued work on ongoing transmission system improvements that included replacing aging equipment such as wooden poles, cross arms, lines and substation controls.
• LG&E and KU also continued investments in new technology to automate the utilities’ electric distribution system and enhance service reliability. The advanced technology, which detects faults and reroutes power, restoring power to as many customers as possible, has already helped prevent nearly 123,000 electric service interruptions.
• WPD installed flood defenses at 72 substations, to improve system resiliency in the face of severe weather.
• WPD improved substation battery life to ensure power is available for 72 hours after a major, network-wide power loss.
• WPD reduced customer interruptions by 40% during the first five years of the eight-year network regulatory period.
• WPD contracted 132 megawatts of demand-side flexibility under its Flexible Power program to accommodate increasing demand for electricity without having to build a larger network. As a result, customers benefit from a resilient energy supply and reduced future energy costs.
SMART GRID, SMART JOBS. 
The transition to a smarter grid has benefits beyond network efficiency and reliability: it also provides job growth opportunities.
LG&E and KU are in the final phase of a $112 million multi-year initiative to upgrade their advanced distribution management system, extend their data analysis capabilities, integrate more than 1,500 smart devices on their network, and deploy a new suite of mobile solutions for field workers.
Developing, installing and maintaining this advanced technology requires a highly skilled workforce. Through this initiative, LG&E and KU have added new positions for engineers and operators in their control centers, while field workers remain as important as ever to make repairs and restore customers’ service.
The smart grid investments allow the utilities to immediately pinpoint the location of power outages, and in many cases, limit the impacted area and automatically restore service for all other customers. The ability to quickly pinpoint the outage location also means crews can respond sooner to make any necessary repairs. Coupled with ongoing investments, the advanced technology has helped to reduce outage frequency and duration by 20% across the utilities’ electric system within the last decade.

VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. 
Millions of people served by PPL’s utilities depend on reliable power for their homes and businesses. Effective vegetation management along distribution and transmission lines is a critical part of maintaining that reliability. Our vegetation management program is designed to promote the safe and reliable operation of the electric grid, while making sure that we are sensitive to the concerns of property owners and our obligations to electricity customers.
We work with conservation, land management and environmental groups to advance common goals of electric reliability and environmental stewardship. As part of our conservation efforts, the utilities donate trees to organizations in the communities we serve to encourage the planting of new trees.
Trees and other tall vegetation need to be kept away from power lines. If they get too close, power outages can result. Tree-related outages can potentially affect thousands of customers for extended periods of time. Keeping overhead power lines clear of limbs and brush also enables our crews to detect and repair issues that impact service during storms. Tree interference also poses potentially significant safety risks to our employees and the public.
PPL’s utilities all conduct tree clearance trimming throughout their service areas on a consistent and planned cycle to maintain reliable service. All the utilities use integrated vegetation management practices, which reduce the need for pesticides, promote healthy ecosystems and provide measurable results, such as greater natural species diversity along rights-of-way and better control of invasive species. Practices include hand clearing of vegetation and targeted use of approved herbicides and pesticides in sensitive areas, including wetlands and farmland.
The utilities are also using LIDAR technology that maps individual trees along transmission rights-of-way. This helps identify a tree that is damaged or diseased before it falls across a power line. The system also assesses tree growth rates, so tree crews can be deployed more precisely. Similarly, data analytics on bird interactions with transmission lines is helping to enhance avian management efforts, protecting birds and saving money.

Whether it’s adding automation to reduce the duration and frequency of outages, making our grid more flexible to enable renewable energy sources or making the system more resilient against natural or cyber threats, we’ve undertaken numerous projects to enhance our system.
In 2020, PPL invested more than $3 billion in infrastructure improvements and projects that strengthen reliability, make the grid smarter and ensure the flexibility needed for future renewable energy resources.
PPL’s utilities are actively monitoring and maintaining their systems, installing advanced metering infrastructure, updating aging power lines and substations, building new ones, and incorporating advanced technology to keep power flowing to our customers.
ADVANCING TECHNOLOGY OF TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION. 
Advanced technology enables us to monitor and address the constantly changing conditions on the grid. We’re installing sensors and relays across the system to send back information in real-time, allowing us to isolate problems and re-route power so the fewest people are affected for the shortest amount of time.
To help reduce maintenance costs, we are harnessing the power of digital science and analytics to tell us when parts need replacement. We can now reliably tell from corrosion rates and other data when a piece of equipment might fail, and replace it preemptively, thus avoiding a power outage.
As technology plays an increasing role in our business, we’re especially attentive to cyber threats and other potential dangers to the grid. We plan and operate our system with the latest intelligence around cyber and physical intrusion and regularly evaluate our security by testing our system’s defenses.
UPGRADING POWER GENERATION ASSETS. 
LG&E and KU are making significant progress on $1 billion in infrastructure projects related to coal combustion residuals, including capping and closing ash impoundments at active and retired coal-fired plants, as well as the installation of state-of-the-art water treatment facilities.
As of 2019, all of the utilities’ remaining coal-fired power plants (Mill Creek, Trimble County, Ghent and E.W. Brown) have been converted to dry coal combustion residual handling and storage.
More than half of the company’s 21 coal combustion residual storage facilities planned for closure are complete, with the remaining scheduled to be completed by 2024.
One of LG&E and KU’s top priorities is to maximize the amount of coal combustion residuals beneficially reused off-site as wallboard, cement, concrete, etc., with the remaining coal combustion residuals to be stored on-site in special dry waste landfills. Beneficially reusing coal combustion residuals reduces greenhouse gas emissions; extends the life of the company's existing landfills (where the materials would otherwise be stored); eliminates the need for future landfills; and generates more revenue, 100% of which is routed to customers as a credit.
Additional capital related to generation assets include improving reliability of existing plants and demolition of retired coal plants. As of January 2021, the companies have demolished and restored the properties of the generating facilities at Green River, Tyrone, Pineville and Cane Run.
INVESTING IN SAFE, RELIABLE NATURAL GAS SERVICE. 
For LG&E, the same type of detailed planning that takes place for the electric system extends into the utility’s natural gas system.
The system is made up of more than 4,700 miles of natural gas transmission and distribution lines; compressor stations that move the gas through the system to customers; and natural gas storage fields that enable LG&E to purchase gas when costs are low, store it for later use, and pass the savings to customers.
LG&E employs comprehensive natural gas safety measures that include 24/7 monitoring by a central Gas Control Room; conducting leak surveys; operating a Pipeline Integrity Management Program that identifies and minimizes potential pipeline risks; and educating community partners and the general public about natural gas safety. In addition to those ongoing efforts, the company’s plans for natural gas infrastructure updates include: • Replacing approximately 45,000 steel customer service lines and removal of approximately 4,400 steel curbed services.
• Implementing a Transmission Pipeline Modernization program to replace approximately 15.5 miles of transmission pipeline.
• Upgrading to city gate stations and gas regulation facilities with new valves, piping, and modern regulation and measurement equipment.

With the transportation sector surpassing power generation as the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, electrifying transportation can help reduce carbon emissions across the economy.
PPL is working to make system enhancements necessary to support electrification efforts, including the adoption of electricity-fueled transportation in our fleets, participating in research on electric vehicles and their impact on the grid, educating customers on electric vehicles, and implementing community partnerships on electric vehicle charging technology.
In 2020, PPL and its family of companies strengthened their commitment to electrification by setting corporate and individual company goals to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in their vehicle fleets. Electrifying our own fleets allows us to lead by example – a fundamental step as we work with customers and policy makers on accelerating electric transportation.
Collectively, PPL’s operating companies expect to reduce carbon emissions by more than 6,000 metric tons between 2020-2025 through electrification of fleet vehicles, with an additional reduction of more than 2,500 metric tons expected between 2026-2030.
Here’s how PPL’s operating companies plan on achieving these goals: • PPL Electric's goal is to spend 10% of transportation capital on electric vehicle technology from 2020 to 2025, which will result in replacing more than 80% of bucket trucks with electric lift technology bucket trucks by 2025. The new technology uses battery power to operate the boom, bucket and lifts used by lineworkers, reducing the need for engine idling. This reduces fuel consumption and maintenance costs and minimizes job site noise. Fuel consumption is reduced by as much as a gallon of diesel fuel per hour of eliminated idling.
• LG&E and KU pledge to electrify 10% of their transportation fleet by 2030 by replacing end-of-lease light duty vehicles with a combination of fully electric vehicles or plug-in hybrids, and outfitting heavy duty vehicles with plug-in idle mitigation units. The company plans to have around 110 total electric vehicles, which will be a blend of light-duty trucks and heavy-duty bucket trucks.
• WPD plans to electrify 22% of its fleet by the end of the first quarter of 2023.
INNOVATIONS ADVANCE GRID SAFETY, RELIABILITY. 
PPL Electric's drive to be among the best electric utilities in the country has created a culture of innovation at the company. Three recent team projects aimed at improving grid safety and reliability have received patents, validating that innovative spirit.
PPL Electric's patents were years in the making, driven by the collective efforts of many employees across various work groups. They are: • Downed Wire Safety Patent recognizes PPL Electric's development of an algorithm that supports the automatic shutoff of power to a downed power line. PPL Electric already had technology on its system that detected a live downed wire but built on that to design a system that would automatically move to shut off power to that line, substantially increasing safety for the public and employees.
• Electromechanical Relays and Smart Grid Patent allows older electromechanical circuit breaker relays on the PPL Electric distribution grid to help reroute power within PPL Electric's smart grid. That work by Distribution Control Center engineering was critical because in the early days of smart grid implementation, those older relays comprised about 75% of the circuit breakers on the distribution grid.
• Pole Attachment Device Patent allows multiple attachments with less impact on the pole and a much cleaner design that extends pole life and improves safety. Called a megavang, it’s a singular piece of hardware made of weathered steel that provides attachment points for up to four wires.

PPL’s operating companies are making investments to expand customer access to renewable and distributed resources and research low-carbon technologies.
IN KENTUCKY, LG&E AND KU: • Built the state’s largest utility-scale solar photovoltaic facility at the company's E.W. Brown Generating Station. The solar facility features more than 45,000 solar panels on approximately 50 acres. The panels produce 19,000 megawatt hours of energy, enough to power more than 1,500 homes based on a usage of 1,000 kilowatt hours per month. The company makes data from the project available to the public, allowing individuals to view energy production in real time.
• Offer a Green Tariff to support the growth of renewable energy and economic development in Kentucky. New or existing businesses can choose from several options to meet their renewable energy goals, including purchasing renewable energy certificates through the Green Energy Program, building a solar array or purchasing solar, hydro or wind power through the utility’s renewable power agreement.
• Implemented a Renewable Power Agreement for customers interested in purchasing renewable power. Through the agreement, LG&E and KU partners with customers to build and provide renewable energy resources. Toyota Motor Manufacturing, which operates the world’s largest Toyota manufacturing facility in Kentucky, and Dow Silicones Corporation are the first companies to partner with LG&E and KU, making a 20-year commitment. The utilities will supply Toyota with 50% of the 100 MW solar facility's energy output — Dow with 25%, and the remaining 25% will be used to serve the utilities' electric customers. Rhudes Creek Solar facility by ibV Energy Partners has been chosen to provide up to 200 megawatts of renewable energy. The solar facility is expected to be completed and commercially available in 2023.
• Offer a Solar Share program, which gives residential, business and industrial customers the opportunity to share in local solar energy and receive credits on their monthly bills. Four 500-kilowatt sections of LG&E and KU’s Solar Share Program are fully subscribed and the company is currently accepting applications for a fifth section. Among the customers taking advantage of the renewable energy installation are the Ford Motor Company, which was the first major founding partner in the program.
• Continue to collaborate with the Electric Power Research Institute on an energy storage research and demonstration site to allow the utilities to develop, test and evaluate the potential benefits and operating needs of large-scale battery technologies. The site includes testing bays for up to 3 megawatts of energy storage.
IN PENNSYLVANIA, PPL ELECTRIC: • Participates in a statewide alternative-energy portfolio standard. From June 2019 to May 2020, alternative power sources comprised 15.7% of the power PPL Electric bought for customers who had not chosen a competitive supplier. This included 7.5% from solar, wind and hydropower energy sources. The projected renewable energy obligation for June 2020 through May 2021 is 18%.
• Developed and implemented an advanced Distributed Energy Resource Management System designed to manage solar, wind and other renewable power coming onto the grid. The system will help the company ensure good power quality and reliability, and keep the grid running smoothly. Moving forward, it will also help PPL Electric better integrate more distributed energy resources like private solar, while preserving network reliability and power quality.
• Made it easier for customers to apply to connect solar panels and other generation systems to the grid through a user-friendly Renewable Energy Connection website. As of December 2020, PPL Electric has connected more than 235.5 megawatts of renewable energy to the grid through the program.
• Received approval from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to require smart inverters on renewable energy installations to ensure the safety and reliability of PPL’s distribution system. The ability to monitor and manage the power flowing through smart inverters will help reduce major investments in new lines or equipment, and accommodate more renewable power coming onto the distribution system.

ACROSS THE U.S., PPL’S RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT COMPANY, SAFARI ENERGY: • Developed or acquired more than 500 commercial- scale solar projects since 2008.
• Spans 24 states and Washington, D.C., with projects generating approximately 618,942 megawatt hours of electricity, or the equivalent of avoiding more than 437,000 metric tons of CO2.
IN THE U.K., WPD: • Continued support of the U.K.’s Net-Zero goal by participating in the U.K. Network Innovation Allowance and Competitions, which has launched projects that test innovative methods to enable the widespread adoption by customers of low-carbon technologies. This includes technology such as solar panels, heat pumps and electric vehicles.
• Connected 6.2 gigawatts of renewable energy to its network.
• Procured 440 megawatts of demand response services across its network.
• Created a Flexible Power portal to allow network collaboration on the largest distribution flexibility market in the U.K. Used by five network operators, the Flexible Power portal gives power providers an easier path to participate in flexibility on multiple networks. Flexible power allows electricity generators and consumers to reduce their demand for electricity during peak periods or, conversely, increase energy supply using existing, on-site power generation assets.
• Launched a digitalization strategy to improve data management, increase network insight and improve business efficiency. The strategy will give WPD greater insight into the everyday operation of its network, enabling the energy system to maximize efficiency and flexibility, as well as allowing the connection of more low-carbon technology like distributed generation, electric vehicle charging hubs or electrified heating while minimizing the need for network reinforcements. Enhanced digitization benefits customers by helping to deliver faster decarbonization and a more responsive network while keeping energy bills down.

ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP. 
PPL has a longstanding commitment to carry out all of our business activities in ways that preserve and promote a clean, safe and healthy environment. This commitment is part of our Standards of Integrity, which define how we conduct PPL’s business. We abide by the environmental laws and regulations of the locations in which we operate and have invested in environmental upgrades at PPL power plants, carbon-free generation projects and programs to encourage energy efficiency.
Conserving and protecting water. 
PPL carefully manages the water it uses and monitors the impact of wastewater discharged into waterways. No water is sourced from regions with high or extremely high baseline water stress. In fact, PPL’s only operations with any significant water usage are the power generation operations in Kentucky. All but one of LG&E and KU’s power plants are located on the Ohio River, which is not adversely affected by drought. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the Ohio River’s water levels daily and those predictions have never resulted in LG&E and KU reducing non-hydro generation due to river temperature or water volume issues. There is only one power plant, the Ohio Falls hydroelectric plant, that could be impacted by low water volume because it is a run-of-river dam. However, that plant accounts for only about 1% of the company’s power generation.
LG&E and KU support programs that protect waterways and the ecosystems that depend on them in the service areas where the utilities operate. The utilities collaborate with a variety of stakeholders and state agencies to ensure that watersheds and reservoirs meet both the needs of the utilities and other stakeholders, including the public.
By utilizing closed-cycle cooling instead of once-through cooling at most of its generating plants, LG&E and KU have greatly reduced the volume of cooling water withdrawn from the region’s watershed. Each facility also has a Groundwater Protection Plan, a Stormwater Best Management Practices Plan, and a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan that facilitates the safe storage of chemicals and oils on site. Proper secondary containment and weekly tank inspections ensure these chemicals remain out of the watershed and groundwater.
The utilities also continue to decrease consumptive water use as they improve power plant efficiency and transition to dry-ash handling at remaining coal-fired power plants in Kentucky. LG&E and KU pay consumptive use fees to cover the costs of reservoir projects and storage space designed to benefit all users and maintain adequate river levels during low-flow periods.

WASTE MANAGEMENT. 
PPL has high standards for managing waste from our operations. In keeping with the company’s commitment to advance a cleaner energy future and encourage responsible stewardship, we seek innovative solutions and opportunities to reduce, reuse and recycle waste materials.
PPL Electric and LG&E completed a major effort in the 1980s and 1990s to remove known polychlorinated biphenyls from their networks. All new transformers contain mineral oil and are classified as non-PCB.
Other waste streams include e-waste, cardboard, municipal trash, scrap metals and wooden utility poles. PPL recycles wood poles in various ways, reusing them as fuel in waste-to-energy projects and as biodegradable landfill cover. APPLIANCE RECYCLING PROGRAM RECEIVES FEDERAL RECOGNITION. 
PPL Electric’s long-standing appliance recycling program has a positive impact on the environment, helping customers reduce emissions and save energy.
The program was recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for outstanding performance in the agency’s first Responsible Appliance Disposal Program Leadership Awards Ceremony in October 2020.
Partners in the Responsible Appliance Disposal Program commit to collecting and disposing of old appliances such as refrigerators and freezers, window air conditioners, and dehumidifiers, using best environmental practices. While complying with laws and regulations on the recovery of refrigerant, used oil, mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), partners have also committed to recovering appliance foam, promoting the recycling of all durable goods, and the permanent disposal of old, inefficient appliances to save energy.
PPL Electric received the 2020 Champion Award for “outstanding performance in foam recovery to avoid emissions of ozone-depleting substances.” This included: • Starting their appliance recycling program in 2009 (refrigerators, freezers, room ACs).
• Adding dehumidifiers in 2017.
• Recycling over 65,500 units to date.
• Continuing an extensive customer awareness and engagement program.
• Actively highlighting and promoting energy efficiency rebate and incentive programs to encourage customer participation to save energy and money. See appendix for full details.

BIODIVERSITY INITIATIVES. 
The day-to-day operation of the power delivery network has the potential to affect ecosystems and habitat. PPL’s operating companies work extensively to ensure the environment is protected while work is being done on the electrical system, especially in sensitive resource areas.
Across our service territories in Kentucky, Pennsylvania and the U.K., our teams work with various partners to protect biodiversity. Some highlights include:
IN KENTUCKY, LG&E AND KU: • Have partnered with Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources for more than 20 years as part of a comprehensive Avian Protection Plan and efforts to promote native vegetation growth in Kentucky.
• Have been a corporate sponsor of the Ohio River Sweep since 1995. Employee volunteers join thousands of people across a multi-state region each year to remove litter and debris from the banks of the Ohio River.
• Offer one-year grants, ranging from $500 to $5,000, for urban, suburban or rural projects in forests and parks and along parkways or roadways that meet program objectives.
• Support research and development projects related to pollinator habitat protection.
• Support research intended to help boost the population of the endangered Indiana bat. The company installed 10 utility poles several years ago that are used as artificial roosting structures at Fort Knox. The project is a coordinated partnership that includes Copperhead Environmental Consulting, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Fort Knox.
IN PENNSYLVANIA, PPL ELECTRIC: • Donated 261 acres of prime bat habitat land to the Pennsylvania Game Commission to protect the habitat for the eastern small- footed bat from future development.
• Has adopted a comprehensive Avian Protection Plan to protect birds from coming in contact with electrical equipment and power lines.
• Continues research and development on management and protection of pollinator habitat. The utility has an ongoing project to test native seed blends for use in right-of-way restoration and substation development.
• Partners with the Pennsylvania Game Commission on projects to protect birds of prey such as peregrine falcons, osprey and eagles.
• Utilizes the Pennsylvania Natural Diversity Inventory system, a tool that aids in identification and protection of species of concern in proposed work areas before work is executed and permits are requested.
• Provided trees to county and municipal parks, environmentally focused groups and schools through its Community Roots program. In 2020, PPL Electric donated over 48,000 trees to public and conservation groups throughout Pennsylvania.
IN THE U.K., WPD: • Provides support to communities across the network area with the aim of encouraging energy conservation, promoting recycling initiatives and enhancing the landscape for wildlife through its Keen to be Green program.
• Works with Natural Resource Wales and Natural England to develop mutually beneficial worksite development plans that integrate habitat protection for various species such as great crested newts, grass snakes, breeding birds, dormice and bats.
• Maintains an invasive species management plan to ensure appropriate measures are in place to minimize the spread of any invasive species present on work sites to avoid disrupting local biodiversity.
• Works to plant 7,000 native trees and shrubs each year through a partnership with the Avon Wildlife Trust, Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust, The Conservation Volunteers and Groundwork Wales.
A ‘EWE’NIQUE PARTNERSHIP. 
Nestled in the rolling hills of Mercer County, Kentucky, E.W. Brown Generating Station is home to four different types of energy generating resources, including a nearly 100-yearold hydroelectric facility and the first, and largest, existing universal solar facility in the commonwealth.
Mowing grass that grows under and around solar arrays can be difficult to do with conventional lawn mowers, so LG&E and KU turned to an unconventional partnership: grazing sheep.
The sheep are generally docile, small and, through their grazing, can keep vegetation at the site to a minimum, which will reduce maintenance costs over the long-term.
LG&E and KU are partnering with Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill – which manages a working farm and nature preserve – on the project. As the sheep manage the solar field’s vegetation, farmers from Shaker Village, Kentucky’s largest National Historic Landmark, will manage the flock.
The flock will initially have 10 acres to graze. By this time next year, the number of sheep is expected to multiply three-fold, eventually growing large enough to maintain the entire 50-acre solar farm.

A HISTORY OF HELPING THE VULNERABLE EASES LOCKDOWN HARDSHIPS. 
When the pandemic prompted a lockdown in the U.K., it was clear that life was going to be even harder for many vulnerable customers. But thanks to a long track record of delivering services for customers in vulnerable situations, WPD was on hand to help.
One of the first things WPD did was get in touch with the 50 organizations that support its fuel poverty plans and ask them to re-scope their activities. This meant that organizations WPD funds to offer energy-saving and tariff-switching advice widened their support to look at other ways of supporting customers.
Activities included providing befriending support and delivering groceries and prescriptions to the customers they had identified as being the most isolated and vulnerable.
WPD was also able to help other agencies by sharing the data it has collected for the Priority Services Register. Over the past five years, WPD’s customer contact center and records teams have proactively reached out to 4.3 million Priority Services Register contacts. As a result, the company has very accurate information about vulnerable customers, including consent from many to share data with other key support agencies during emergencies.
At the start of the lockdown WPD contacted every local authority, local resilience forum and utility provider in the region to help them identify those most in need.
ENERGY SAVINGS. 
WeCare (Weatherization, Conservation Advice and Recycling Energy) is designed to create savings through weatherization and energy education to help LG&E and KU income-eligible customers in need.
WRAP — PPL Electric’s Winter Relief Assistance Program — helps customers with limited incomes reduce their home energy use and lower their electric bills. WRAP provides energy education and energy-saving measures for customers, when applicable. All measures and services are free. While the pandemic halted in-person meetings, the company implemented virtual energy audits to continue this program.
Power Up and Affordable Warmth are WPD’s fuel poverty referral programs. The utility works with partners to refer customers in need of support to help pay their energy bills. The programs helped customers save more than $14.7 million in the last year alone – an average of more than $800 per benefiting customer.
VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS. 
WPD offers a Priority Services Register for customers who rely on electricity for medical equipment, older adults, people with disabilities, and those who feel vulnerable in the event of a power outage. The register provides participating customers a direct number to call in the event of a power outage, a password to be used for any needed home visits, special help through the British Red Cross and proactive messages about planned electricity supply interruptions.

Board and senior management oversight of corporate culture occurs in the following ways:
Diversity, equity and inclusion – The Expanded Corporate Leadership Council is engaged in the formation and implementation of the diversity strategy. The Expanded Corporate Leadership Council is presented with demographic metrics and diversity objectives and their associated programs semi-annually. This data-driven approach led to the formation of the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Commitments, which are the framework for the diversity strategy going forward. The director of Diversity, Inclusion and Talent Management reports to the board on the company’s diversity strategy and actions undertaken to advance that strategy.
Compliance – The Corporate Compliance Committee of senior executives meets quarterly to discuss metrics and other matters related to the compliance and ethics culture. Among the items discussed are statistics regarding EthicsHelpline reports and employee concerns. This information is also reviewed with the Audit Committee of the board quarterly.
Employee engagement – PPL’s operating companies regularly conduct assessments related to employee engagement, safety and culture.
Safety – The board annually reviews safety programs and results. The board is also informed in the event of a fatality.
Access to employees – Board members are given full access to our employees and operations and have taken advantage of opportunities to interact with employees while learning about different areas of the company firsthand.

PPL’s companies have a combined 15 business resource groups. These busines resource groups support PPL’s diversity, equity and inclusion strategy.
Throughout the year, business resource group members organize employee events to educate fellow employees and build awareness on diversity and inclusion, as well as professional development. Members are also actively involved in various cultural and community programs that enable them to extend their reach outside their workplaces, including student mentoring, outreach to homeless veterans and cultural awareness workshops.

Although PPL has a relatively low turnover rate of 5.8%, the company has a strong focus on workforce planning. This enables PPL to: • Forecast ebbs and flows in workforce requirements.
• Determine the size and type of workforce required for future business success.
• Identify and address talent gaps and plan for future talent needs.
• Develop plans, sourcing strategies and tactics.
Workforce planning results are integrated into the business planning process.
PPL is focused on continually developing current employees, while also building a strong pipeline of skilled workers for the future. The company has also continued efforts to build a more inclusive workforce.
To attract top talent, PPL supports a strong internship program that engages students in career-specific work experience, informational interviews, fun activities, exposure to PPL executives and community service. On average, about 60% of our interns become full-time employees. In 2020, the internship program was done virtually with PPL Corporation and PPL Electric hosting 49 interns representing 21 different universities. The students are studying a variety of fields, including engineering, information technology, supply chain management, data analytics and security. PPL’s intern program also serves as an excellent source of diversity. In 2020, there were 49 interns (40.8% women, 40.8% minorities).
LG&E and KU have a robust co-op and internship program for college students pursing a bachelor’s degree. In 2020, 180 students participated in the college relations co-op/intern program (34% women, 14% minorities). Additionally, in 2020, 30 former co-op/intern students were hired into full-time positions (40% women, 10% minorities). Students are provided not only real-world work experiences, but also opportunities to learn about different areas of the business and network with other employees at all levels of the organization.
PPL participates in many recruiting efforts focusing on underrepresented populations, such as women, ethnic and racial minorities, LGBTQ+, veterans and individuals with disabilities. Career fairs, multicultural leadership conferences, university leadership summits, mock interviews, resume reviews, panel discussions, career bootcamps, networking and affinity group sponsorships are part of our ongoing efforts to maintain PPL’s position as an employer of choice.
CRAFT TRADE APPRENTICE AND TRAINEE PROGRAMS. 
PPL’s companies are taking a proactive approach to expanding the talent pool for positions that will be available in the next several years due to retirements. In addition to college co-op programs, the company actively recruits and trains trade craft workers.
PPL Electric has several apprenticeship programs for various lineworker positions and hires from trade and technical schools throughout the company’s 29-county service territory in eastern and central Pennsylvania. Entry level electricians with the prerequisite skills and external training are hired as lineworker trainees and PPL provides an additional four years of training in an apprenticeship program.
The utility has partnered with a local community college to establish a line work program that teaches students electrical-, cable- and communications-related line work.
The program has helped to fill a local void for workforce training and has been added to the state’s High Priority Occupation Training program list, allowing Pennsylvania residents who are eligible for Workforce Investment Act or Trade Adjustment Act funding to pay little or nothing for the course.
PPL Electric also offers a trainee program for customer service positions, taking a nesting approach to training to ensure trainees can field customer questions before they work on their own. As they progress, they learn more and more complex issues following the same model.
In Kentucky, LG&E and KU have an active craft worker internship program, which focuses on recruiting top student talent directly from community and technical colleges in and around the utilities' service territories. Students are able to gain hands-on knowledge about the various career paths that LG&E and KU offer while they obtain the degrees that are required for many craft worker positions.
Strategic partnerships have been created at a number of schools around the region. Recruitment efforts build awareness of the various career paths and opportunities within LG&E and KU.
In the U.K., WPD’s apprenticeship training takes a minimum of two years and includes positions for overhead lineworkers, who work on the network that is supported by wooden poles or steel towers, jointers who work on the underground cable network, and fitters who work on switches and transformers in substations.
In addition to craft apprentices, WPD also offers a three-year structured training program for planning and design trainees, who develop skills in design and development of projects, including new supplies and asset replacement.

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION. 
PPL supports its employees’ right to freedom of association, as well as the right to form or join a union, bargain collectively and engage in union activities. Nearly half of PPL’s workforce is represented by a labor union, and the company’s operating utilities collaborate with union leadership to enhance workplace safety, meet the growing expectations of our customers, and adapt to the challenges of rapidly changing technologies.
Among other things, employees are encouraged to participate in health and safety groups such as the safety advocate program and to join one or more business resource groups, which are employee-driven organizations formed around common experiences and perspectives.

Bargaining unit employees have access to a grievance procedure for internal dispute resolution. The grievance procedure promotes a prompt and responsible conclusion of issues raised by bargaining unit employees.
LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT. 
PPL’s operating companies are committed to creating a workplace atmosphere that rewards performance and encourages professional development.
All employees are eligible for professional development courses. While COVID-19 posed particular training challenges, PPL changed its delivery model to offer virtual training opportunities to keep employees safe. The company also added virtual courses to help employees address the challenges of working remotely.
Beyond occupational training, the companies offer: • Craftworker and lineworker development programs.
• Leadership development programs.
• Personal skills and management training courses.
• Mentoring programs.
• Skill development opportunities.
BENEFITS. 
Our partnership with employees has successfully powered PPL for decades and has fostered an environment that encourages employees to directly contribute to the overall success of PPL.
In addition to challenging careers and competitive salaries, PPL offers an excellent benefits program that helps to attract and retain talent and supports employees’ well-being. Benefits include: • High-quality comprehensive medical, dental, vision, life insurance and disability coverage.
• Paid-time off policies for vacation or illness.
• Family leave benefits that provide employees with up to six weeks of leave following the birth or adoption of a child. The expanded family leave benefits also include financial assistance for adoption and more flexibility with sick time, allowing employees to tend to family members or aging parents if the need arises.

STRENGTHEN COMMUNITY VITALITY. 
PPL strives to empower the success of future generations by helping to build and maintain strong, diverse communities today.
We believe for our company to be successful, the communities we serve need to be successful. With local philanthropic programs in each operating region, our charitable investments are helping to meet the needs of our communities. Working with nonprofit and community partners, our philanthropic investments support many efforts helping to drive communities forward through programs focused on: • Capacity building for nonprofits • Diversity, equity and inclusion • Equitable education • Economic and workforce development • Health and safety • Sustainable local community projects $12.1 million Total charitable giving 31,000.

EMPLOYEES GIVE BACK TO COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. 
For 100 years, we have had a special connection to our local communities, knowing that the service we provide is essential to families and businesses. At the same time, generations of PPL employees have always understood that we can make a positive impact beyond the electricity and gas we provide.
At a time when community need is as great as ever, PPL teamed up with employees and retirees to give back and make a difference. In 2020, the company’s employee giving campaigns in the U.S. raised a record $7 million in employee and retiree pledges, together with matching funds from the corporation's foundations.
The funds generated by the 2020 United Way campaign in Pennsylvania, Power of One campaign in Kentucky and United Way campaign at PPL's Safari Energy subsidiary in New York City, will support local United Way agencies and nonprofit organizations that are a force for good in our communities.
This community investment will assist families struggling with COVID-19; expand educational opportunities for children; support access to health care services, food, shelter and other basic needs; and offer additional assistance for healthy communities. Community investment is one of the many ways the company works year-round to uphold its values, which include a focus on corporate citizenship.

In 2020, COVID-19 and the racial justice movement brought a heightened awareness of the impact that can be made through community partnerships and investments.
From Pennsylvania’s small towns and the busy streets of Louisville, Kentucky, to the rolling countryside of Wales in the U.K., every community we serve was facing the same challenge. PPL’s response to COVID-19 included: • Significant donations of PPE to local hospitals and emergency management agencies.
• Grants of $500,000 to assistance programs to help energy customers facing economic hardships.
• Contributions totaling more than $2 million in funding to COVID-19 relief efforts to support to our customers and communities.
In the U.K., WPD established a fund to help charities and community groups that provide vital support to vulnerable and socially isolated residents, as well as essential workers. Through the fund, WPD awarded $1.45 million to 871 organizations, supporting more than 560,000 people affected by the pandemic. The support helped fund food and prescription delivery, helplines, the delivery of personal protective equipment to hospitals, and more.
Additionally, corporate responsibility staff actively worked with nonprofit partners to facilitate virtual volunteer activities for employees to help communities and individuals hit hardest by COVID-19. Some of the virtual activities included tutoring students in under-resourced schools, sewing masks for healthcare workers and sending cards and letters to older adults isolated in nursing homes.
In the U.S., the racial justice movement brought to light the inequities faced by Black citizens in our communities.
While diversity and inclusion have always been key considerations in the choices we make when investing in local communities, the PPL Foundation announced in June that it would expand the mission and focus to more directly support racial justice and equity initiatives. The announcement was paired with an initial contribution of $100,000 to Pennsylvania organizations working to make real and lasting changes in these areas.
In Kentucky, the LG&E and KU Foundation donated $100,000 to agencies offering expanded education assistance to help combat the educational achievement gap for students of color.
As virtual instruction continues across Kentucky, the ongoing work of schools and agencies providing non-traditional instruction support continues to be critical for students and their families. In many cases, the work of these agencies helps bridge the achievement gap for students of color and their families, who may not have the resources or access necessary, and eases the burden for working parents who aren’t able to stay home to assist with their child’s virtual schooling.
The contribution will help fund educational assistance programs such as learning hubs, access to substitute teachers, tech support, emotional and social support and mentoring.

PPL’s emergency management plan summarizes the prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response, business continuity and recovery activities that serve as the comprehensive integrated approach to establishing and maintaining an effective response to, and recovery from, internal or external disasters.
In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic tested the company’s emergency management preparedness and process like never before. Fortunately, PPL has maintained a pandemic plan for more than 10 years and used this as the foundation for its response to COVID-19.
The company began monitoring and discussing COVID-19 activities in late January and early February, activating a Pandemic Response Team, local emergency and business continuity plans, and the corporate Executive Crisis Team strategy.
The Executive Crisis Team, including leadership across the enterprise, began regular meetings in March that have continued to date. The focus of these meetings is to monitor activity across the enterprise, evaluate potential impact to operations, define and resolve unmet needs, and continually refine the pandemic response strategy, including developing a responsible return-to-work plan.
The Executive Crisis Team meetings were supplemented by daily reports of activity across the U.S. and the U.K. The report includes links to government actions, media reports and government resources, including meeting summaries from the Edison Electric Institute. Regular meetings continue with pandemic team representatives across the enterprise where status of cases, unmet needs and best practices are shared.
PPL’s strategy focused on balancing the safety of our employees with the critical needs of our customers. Efforts included: • Isolating essential workers.
• Enhancing availability of technology equipment and systems to support a remote work environment for support roles.
• Implementing new protocols such as smaller work groups and remote reporting to minimize contact and increase social distancing for essential workers.
• Utilizing a number of resources to support effective communications to our workforce, including websites dedicated to COVID-19 work-related information and mass notification systems for consistent messaging.
PPL continues to work closely with government and industry representatives, including participating in Edison Electric Institute pandemic calls; Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council pandemic calls; and communications with state level emergency management and utility groups.
While a limited number of employees across the enterprise have tested positive for COVID-19, the company has not experienced any impact to operations.

Mapping out long-term energy plans that contribute to economic well-being is part of the way PPL’s companies work to provide a bright future for the communities we serve. We understand enhancement and construction of utility infrastructure, at a reasonable cost, is vital to attracting and retaining businesses that create jobs for our communities.
PPL’s subsidiaries and their executives are actively involved in business organizations, such as chambers of commerce and economic development organizations.
We provide incentives to support economic development efforts. For example, LG&E and KU’s Economic Development Rider — an incentive rate for existing industry expansions, new project locations and redevelopment initiatives within the service area — continues to be recognized as an exemplary business attraction tool.
The company’s Economic Development and Major Accounts team works with state, county and local officials, regional partners, site consultants, real estate developers and industry associations on potential business relocations and expansions.
In the U.K., WPD supports local energy plans and works collaboratively with local authorities and businesses as part of Energy Capital, a smart energy innovation partnership. Energy Capital facilitates public/private investment projects across the region and works closely with local communities in the West Midlands region.
In Pennsylvania, PPL Electric key account managers work to engage business and industrial customers to help them get the most from their energy dollar through the utility’s energy efficiency programs. They also serve as liaisons with operations to assist with the electrical power needs of large customers and proactively address potential reliability issues. In addition, PPL Electric’s regional affairs directors are actively involved in various organizations throughout central and eastern Pennsylvania dedicated to helping communities thrive.

Anyone who stood in front of empty supermarket shelves in 2020 wondering where all the toilet paper went may have found a new appreciation for the important role the supply chain plays in getting the products we need where we need them, when we need them.
PPL’s supply chain organizations negotiate and secure contracts to procure materials, labor and services necessary to support the business and infrastructure investment. Our ongoing partnerships with a cadre of diverse suppliers ensured we were able to get the wires, poles, fuel and countless products that help us keep the power flowing for our customers.
PPL’s operating companies require suppliers and contractors to observe our high standards of business ethics, and professional and personal integrity, when bidding or providing materials or services to PPL.
The company’s enterprise-wide Supplier Code of Conduct, which applies to anyone supplying goods or services to PPL, includes guidelines on a variety of topics including diversity, corruption, ethics and cybersecurity. We also expect our suppliers to extend these standards to their own supply chains with respect to goods and services provided to us.
Accordingly, PPL reviews the safety and environmental performance of our business partners and incorporates compliance requirements in purchase orders and contracts. The value PPL places on diversity carries over to the people from whom the company purchases goods and services.
PPL and its operating companies actively reach out to find diverse businesses — including those owned by minorities, women and veterans. PPL Electric, LG&E and KU host annual supplier networking events to attract business leaders who will help expand the diversity of our supplier base.

In Kentucky, LG&E and KU President and CEO Paul Thompson is helping lead and co-chair Metro Louisville’s community-wide supplier diversity task force — an effort created with the intention of driving meaningful change by increasing spending with diverse businesses on large capital projects.
Established in September 2020, the Equity in Contracting and Procurement Task Force is charged with working to close the community’s wealth gap by supporting Black-, minority- and female-owned business enterprises, as well as businesses owned by those with disabilities. The task force supports supplier diversity initiatives, particularly related to capital projects.
“We are pleased to be a part of an effort that has the potential to drive meaningful change for our city and its diverse population,” said Thompson. “The economic future of our region must include a focus on building Black wealth and expanding other diverse businesses.
