Renault Group’s annual publications for 2020 include a Universal registration docume and a Climate Report. This choice reflects the proactive environmental strategy that the Group has firmly pursued across all business activities since 2005. The Group has set the aim to achieve carbon neutrality in Europe by 2040 and worldwide by 2050. With the publication of its first Climate Report, it reaffirms its strong commitments to a sustainable mobility that protects natural ecosystems. The report is complementary to the new strategic plan, Renaulution, presented on January 14, 2021. This Climate Report applies the guidelines issued by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which advises companies on how to evaluate and disclose the risks and opportunities posed by climate change. The Group has supported the TCFD since 2019 and considers its recommendations to be a relevant framework for communicating to stakeholders on climate issues in the transition to a low-carbon economy. The correspondence table on page 56 of the report shows how the information presented by the Group ties in with the TCFD’s recommendations. KPMG, acting as an independent third party, reviewed and expressed a reasonable assurance on the following indicators presented in this report: Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions.

Today, the magnitude of the climate challenge and the urgent need for collective action are no longer subject to debate. Renault Group is making concrete and wide-ranging contributions to carbon emissions reduction, with the aim to achieve carbon neutrality in Europe by 2040 and worldwide by 2050.
— Renault Group was the first full-line carmaker to embrace the all-electric car. Eight years after the launch of the first ZOE, with more than 390,000 electric vehicles on the road, we are making a significant contribution to reducing emissions of vehicles in use. Off the road, we have developed a pathway to decarbonize our operations: upstream, by reducing the carbon footprint of our production facilities and suppliers, and downstream, by the remanufacturing, disassembly and recycling of end-of-life vehicles and their batteries on an industrial scale.
For this, we have begun the transformation of the Group’s Flins factory, which will become. 
Europe’s leading circular economy site dedicated to mobility. The Renaulution strategic plan will move Renault Group from a volume to a value approach and from the mindset of car manufacturer to that of mobility operator. We are scaling up the electrification of the product plan for our various brands. As of 2025, every new model launched under the Renault brand will be electric or electri- fied. At the same time, we are accelerating the delivery of new mobility, energy and data services through our recently created Mobilize brand. At the company’s highest level, we are taking action and making decisions for the climate. We have created an Ethics and CSR Committee within the. 
Board of Directors to reinforce our climate governance. What’s more, we are playing in a team. We know that the fight for the climate can only be won by combining our expertise, our actions and our talents. We will also scout out expertise and boost our know-how through joint ventures, so we can progress faster and with the best in the areas of hydrogen technology, end-of-life battery recycling and decarbonized supply chains. We are collaborating with Movin’On Lab, a coalition of more than 300 companies deeply engaged in mobility.
We are proud to have been the first carmaker to obtain the validation of the SBTi (Science Based. 
Targets initiative) for our climate pathway in 2019 and aim to achieve carbon neutrality in Europe by 2040 and worldwide by 2050. Our climate project is a pillar of our engagement and responsible capitalism: it is core to the Group’s transformation and purpose, which integrates economic per- formance with environmental performance.

INSIDE CLIMATE CHANGE a. 
The greenhouse effect is a natural and even necessary phenomenon, by which some of the heat from the sun’s rays is retained by certain gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. This helps the Earth maintain a habitable temperature for all its ecosystems. However, due to the massive production of CO2 resulting from human activity and population growth, this heat-trapping process has intensified, increasing our planet’s surface temperature. This is the main cause of climate change, which has led to a greater frequency of extreme and devastating environmental events, which include floods, storms, forest fires and droughts. Ultimately, the survival of the world’s ecosystems is at stake.
a. 
Oceans and plants capture the carbon dioxide emitted by people and animals and by human activities, keeping the quantity of carbon at a stable level. This balance has been upset by the significant burning of fossil fuels (gas, oil and coal) by humans, combined with the spread of artificial land due to urban sprawl. This disruption can be slowed by increasing our use of renewable energy, recycling and non-motorized transportation, such as bicycles. We can also expand the Earth’s carbon absorption capacity by replanting forests and developing other carbon capture solutions. a. 
Carbon neutrality is achieved when the volume of CO2 emissions generated by an organization or region is balanced by an equivalent removal of carbon, whether through natural carbon sinks or industrial processes for carbon capture and reuse. This is different from carbon offsetting, in which the impact of fossil fuel emissions in one area is neutralized by financing new carbon sinks in another area (such as reforestation or carbon capture solutions).

The collaborative participation of citizens, businesses and governments was decisive in the finalization of the Paris Agreement. This synergy is equally essential to its successful implementation. Well aware of the automotive industry’s climate challenges and role, Renault Group has aligned its carbon footprint reduction strategy with the targets set by the Paris Agreement to “pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C”. In April 2021, the Group announced its aim to achieve carbon neutrality in Europe by 2040, in alignment with the European Green Deal, and worldwide by 2050.

TANGIER: THE NET ZERO CARBON PLANT. 
Since 2012, Renault’s plant in Tangier has been a worldwide beacon of environmental excellence. Ninety-two percent of the energy it uses is thermal and produced from biomass consisting of olive pomace, a residue of olive oil manufacturing. The addition of locally produced wind power means that renewable sources meet virtually all its energy needs. As a result, more than 86,000 tons of CO2 emissions were avoided in 2020. In addition to its “zero carbon, zero emissions” performance, the plant is also recognized for its “zero industrial effluent discharges”.
AND ELSEWHERE?
In France, the Douai plant (featuring a smart electric ecosystem using stationary storage) and the Cléon plant (an Industry 4.0 pilot site) are innovative, emblematic examples of the. 
Group’s energy efficiency strategy. In Brazil, the. 
Group has signed a framework agreement with.

At Renault Group, we are proud of what we have already accomplished. Ten years ago, we were the first to embrace the circular economy and electric vehicles. Over the past decade, we have reorganized our Group’s management and working methods to develop ever more innovative models. Our efforts have paid off, in particular by making Renault Group the. 
European leader for electric vehicles. Continuing on this path, we put our climate project at the heart of the Renaulution strategic plan, aligning with the new expectations of civil society and rising generations, who demand a more sustainable economic model.
In this Climate Report, we take the time to describe our ambitions, our methods and our strategic actions to achieve carbon neutrality, guided by a series of short- and medium-term milestones. We wanted to share with you our determination to meet the climate challenge by developing technological solutions that are at once innovative, ecological and systemic.
This period of transition has led us to reshape our organization, step up our climate response and interact with a multitude of partners. By collaborating with cities, regions, energy players,
NGOs and academics, we can advance together toward sustainable mobility. We are diversifying our businesses: with batteries, we are working at the frontier between the automotive and energy sectors. Increasingly, cars are at the intersection of different worlds: cities, energy and digital.
In this report, you will learn about our decarbonization pathways, powered by our know-how and centers of excellence in France and abroad. With the Re-Factory being created in Flins, the Group is once again ahead of the curve in environmental innovation and excellence. —

a. 
LCA is a science-based tool used to quantify a vehicle’s environmental impacts throughout its life cycle, encompassing raw material extraction, the manufacturing and assembly of components, and the vehicle’s transportation, use, maintenance and recycling. Renault Group uses this internationally standardized, multi-criteria tool to calculate the potential contribution to global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions* and to validate the environmental benefits of its technological innovations. LCA calculations are made for new vehicles and cover 80% of vehicle sales.
a. 
In Europe, vehicles sold that do not meet annual quantitative targets for CO2/km exhaust emissions are penalized (CAFE standards). In 2018, the Group set up the CAFE Control. 
Tower, a team tasked specifically with ensuring that vehicles comply with regulatory CO2 emissions targets. Outside of Europe, the Group must meet similar regulatory standards. In all, about 70% of Group sales around the world are subject to CAFE-type regulations.
a. 
In 2020, 80% of the carbon footprint of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles was generated by emissions during vehicle use and fuel production. These are called “well-to- wheel” emissions. For electric vehicles, well-to-wheel emissions are generated during the production of electricity. Over their entire life cycle (including battery manufacturing), electric vehicles have an average carbon footprint that is 28% smaller than equivalent ICE vehicles, in Europe. In France, their footprint is 64% smaller.** *Measured in CO2e/vehicle sold **Comparative LCA analysis, ZOE vs. CLIO.

ACTION #1. 
WHY?
HOW?
An internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle emits three times more CO2 in its life cycle than an electric vehicle*. In Europe, member states must implement national energy and climate plans (NECP) guaranteeing their contribution to achieving the EU’s climate and energy goals. As part of this effort, they are phasing out the sale of ICE vehicles (by 2030 for the United Kingdom and by 2040 at the latest for France). Furthermore, the UN predicts that two-thirds of the world’s population will be urban by 2050, and cities are already increasingly restricting access for ICE cars.

ACTION #2. 
WHY?
HOW?
With emblematic models like KANGOO, TRAFIC and MASTER, Renault is the European leader of the light commercial vehicle (LCV) market. Fast growth in this sector and tougher diesel regulations have led the Group to develop electric versions of these models. Today, its goal is to improve their range and charging speed.

WHY?
HOW?
A personal car is actually in use only 10% of the time. Meanwhile, it loses half its value in just three years. With this knowledge, some users are seeking to reduce the overall cost of their travel and turning to new mobility solutions. One of these is shared mobility, which optimizes the use of a car and reduces the number of vehicles in circulation, as well as their environmental impact.

Accelerate the deployment of higher performing, low-carbon and reusable batteries. 
ACTION #5. 
WHY?
HOW?
Producing the battery of an electric car accounts for a third of its carbon footprint according to ADEME* (due to the use of electricity from fossil fuels and the extraction of strategic raw materials such as cobalt and lithium). Starting in 2024, the European Union will require battery manufacturers to measure this footprint over a battery’s life cycle, from production to recycling. A European draft regulation plans to set a maximum carbon footprint threshold for batteries put on the market as of 2027.

Why must we act now to reinvent the car?
CLOTILDE DELBOS — User demands and mobility habits are changing. Our customers are looking for fit-for-purpose mobility solutions that will optimize the cost of their journey, using vehicles that are more friendly to the environment. The automotive industry needs to reinvent itself to meet their expectations, or others will seize the opportunity. It is up to us to deliver low-carbon, flexible mobility solutions to suit all types of customers. To make the most of our natural resources, we must build these solutions around vehicles made mainly with materials from the circular economy. Mobilize, a business unit newly created by Renault Group, will help to meet this challenge and enable the Group to reinvent itself by offering flexible mobility and energy-related services.
How does Mobilize contribute to Renault Group’s climate goals? — To rein in global warming, cars must reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.
How do we achieve this? By promoting the transition to electric vehicles while optimizing and extending battery life. Our goal at Mobilize is to create sustainable ecosystems that combine electric mobility with smart charging and the second-life reuse of batteries for storing renewable energies. These solutions will contribute to regional carbon neutrality goals and Renault. 
Group’s climate ambition.
Today, to achieve success, you need partners. Who do you work with? — We are facing a structural and societal transformation that compels us to work in partnerships and create synergy at every level. We intend to build on the best ecosystems to maximize the usefulness of cars while minimizing their environmental impact.
We will achieve our goal by combining our expertise with that of other mobility and energy players, public authorities and tech startups and partners – in particular through Software. 
République – to create innovative data, energy and mobility services.
To support this transformation and make it a success, the engagement of every Group team is essential. Only by working together to pull all these levers can we achieve our carbon neutrality ambition.

ELECTRICITY, A CORE DRIVER OF THE ENERGY TRANSITION. 
The International Energy Agency has estimated that “the share of electricity in final energy consumption will exceed 30% by 2040 and reach almost 50% by 2070”. In transportation, electricity will overtake oil as the main source of final energy in 2050. This shift means that low-carbon production of electricity must be massively increased to ensure that electric vehicles are fully contributing to CO2 emissions reduction. On the consumer end, the industry must ensure the wide availability of charging infrastructure, energy storage solutions and innovative technologies like smart charging. Car manufacturers must also deploy value chains to supply low- carbon batteries.
COORDINATED ACTION BY ALL ENERGY AND MOBILITY PLAYERS. 
The development of new energy industries and cleaner transportation solutions calls for a common strategy by energy producers, energy network managers, battery manufacturers and carmakers. Equally critical is the support of public policymakers, through regulations encouraging low-carbon energy use and production, electric mobility and innovations in sustainable technologies. In addition, the massive deployment of charging infrastructure will eliminate a major obstacle to the purchase of electric, hybrid, natural gas and LPG vehicles.
CONCRETE ACTION a Promoting renewable energies: Developing stationary storage is at the heart of the SmartHubs project being carried out in the United Kingdom, in partnership with Connected. 
Energy, the world leader in energy storage. It uses second- life battery systems to supply low-carbon energy for housing, transportation equipment, infrastructure and local businesses.
a Facilitating charging: The INCIT-EV project, initiated and coordinated by Renault Group, brings together 33 industry players, universities, cities, startups and SMEs to gain insights into consumers’ needs and constraints and how to integrate new technologies into charging infrastructure. By 2023, a range of real-life solutions (high-power, inductive, hub, etc.) will be tested in six countries. —

a The GBA (Global Battery Alliance) is a coalition of 70 leading industry players such as Renault Group, public institutions, international organizations, NGOs and academics.
It aims to establish a sustainable battery value chain and develop a battery passport as a solution to enable data traceability and resource efficiency across the battery life cycle.
TOGETHER WITH CITIZENS. 
Consumer-citizen behavior is central to the construction of possible and desirable futures. But consumer-citizens do not all have the same expectations or motivations with respect to climate change. According to the ZEN 2050 report published by EpE* in partnership with 27 companies from all industries, the desire to live in a healthier, more environmentally friendly world combined with an easier access to low-carbon infrastructure, products and services will ultimately result in an overall transformation of mobility, housing and consumption behaviors, accompanied by a significant decline in household.

TOGETHER WITH THE ELLEN MACARTHUR FOUNDATION. 
Renault Group is a founding member of the. 
Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF), which it has supported for ten years. Together, they are working to shift from the legacy, linear “take, make, waste” model to a circular model in which waste is eliminated, resources circulate and nature is protected.
The Foundation communicates with decision-makers around the world about the crucial role of the circular economy in fighting climate change but also about the opportunities it delivers for economic resilience and growth.
Renault Group is harnessing the three main circular opportunities identified by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation: using innovation and eco-design to extend the life of parts and vehicles, encouraging car sharing and reducing the weight of vehicles. Their combined effect would reduce global CO2 emissions from use of materials in passenger car production by 70% by 2050. This scenario implies a systemic change in the world of mobility.
TOGETHER WITH BUSINESSES AND STARTUPS. 
Renault Environnement coordinates metal recycling and recovery of end-of-life vehicles through its three subsidiaries:
GAIA (wholly owned by Renault Group), INDRA (a 50-50 joint venture with SUEZ), Boone Comenor Metalimpex (held jointly with SUEZ, 33% ownership by Renault Group).
Renault Group also collaborates with the industrial groups. 
Veolia and Solvay for the closed-loop recycling of electric vehicle battery materials to save resources, reduce carbon emissions and create value across the chain.
At the Re-Factory in Flins, France, Renault Group will launch an incubator open to outside partners (startups, academics, business groups, local authorities, etc.) to develop projects “in vivo”, right at the heart of a large industrial facility. —
ELLEN MACARTHUR, CHAIR OF THE ELLEN MACARTHUR FOUNDATION “To resolve global issues such as climate change, we need to transform the way the economy functions. By working together, we can create an economy that eliminates waste, keeps resources in circulation and regenerates nature — a circular economy.” “At Station Flins, we will explore new areas with people from a variety of backgrounds.

To secure its convergence toward regulatory CAFE. 
CO2 emissions targets, in 2019, Renault Group rolled out a tool to forecast CO2 emissions levels for Group registered vehicles in Europe. A specific program team, the CAFE. 
Control Tower, monitors these levels and adjusts the road map for the current and following years accordingly.
The organization of the Climate Project, set up in 2020, complements this governance framework.
The Strategic Environmental Planning department prepares, deploys and monitors the implementation of the environmental policy in all sectors of the company. To this end, it uses a network of representatives who are assigned to all company departments, as well as the expertise network created within the Group in 2010 in areas such as “energy, environment and raw materials strategy", “vehicle CO2” and “air quality and substances". These experts provide in-depth knowledge on these strategic topics and implement a cross- cutting approach that has been recognized internally for its rigor and neutrality.
Within each operational department, one or more climate project contributors have been appointed. Their role is to adapt the Group’s climate objectives to each business, build medium- and long-term roadmaps, coordinate action plans and report on performance. Reporting is carried out at operational department level and consolidated by the.

COMPENSATION TIED TO MEETING CO2 EMISSIONS. 
REDUCTION TARGETS AND ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENTS. 
In light of the importance of climate issues for the. 
Group, the compensation of corporate officers is tied to a climate-related conditions, among other qualitative criteria. The target, introduced in 2013, is “leadership in environmental performance: CO2 emissions of vehicles in. 
Europe, Renault Group carbon footprint". More recently, on the recommendation of the Governance and Compensation committee, the Board of Directors proposed to change the compensation policy of the Chief Executive Officer for 2020 and 2021 by adding two new climate-related criteria: a a condition tied to meeting the European regulatory target for passenger car CO2 emissions (CAFE standards 1), on which short-term variable compensation is based. The achievement of this target is a financial and reputational issue and a priority for the Group; a a condition tied to reducing the carbon footprint of. 
Renault Group registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles worldwide, excluding AVTOVAZ2, on which long-term compensation, paid in the form of performance shares, is based. The quantitative targets are a 25% reduction of the carbon footprint in 2022 and a 27% reduction in 2023 compared to 2010. These targets are consistent with the 2017-2022 trajectory and the Group’s greenhouse gas reduction targets for 2030.— 1. CAFE: Corporate Average Fuel Economy 2.

STRATEGY. 
C limate-related risks were analyzed and placed in two categories: transition risks, arising from the shift to a low-carbon economy and all the changes that it implies, and physical risks, along with their potential repercussions on business activity and on supply chains. Short-term (<2030), medium-term (2030-2040) and long-term (2040-2050) milestones were established for each risk.

TRANSITION RISKS SHORT-TERM MEDIUM-
TERM LONG-TERM DESCRIPTION AND IMPACT ON THE GROUP’S PERFORMANCE (< 2030) (2030-2040) (2040-2050)
REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS. 
CO2 emissions regulations for vehicles are frequently updated to apply increasingly stringent standards.
In Europe, the CAFE emissions target of 95g CO2/km for new passenger cars as of 2020 was adjusted in 2021 to apply the WLTP standard. In the event of non-compliance, a penalty payment of 95 euros per excess gram per vehicle sold is due. Based on current sales volumes, each excess gram of CO2/km would incur a penalty of approximately €120 million.
Regulatory changes may also introduce traffic bans or restrictions for certain vehicles. These changes may impact R&D costs and/or production costs, arising from the need to adapt our vehicles to the new standards.
TECHNOLOGY RISKS. 
The Group is building its offering around lesser-polluting vehicles, in particular by expanding electric vehicle ranges and designing hybrid solutions for internal combustion engines. The introduction of these technologies, which offer different performances in terms of cost, customer service and CO2 emissions, may not match the market’s expectations and pace of growth.
CO2e emissions reduction targets will also entail the adjustment of industrial processes and the rollout of low-carbon production technologies in the short and medium terms. The necessary modernization of plants to increase their energy efficiency may push up production and R&D costs.
RISKS RELATED TO MARKET CHANGES. 
Combined with regulatory changes, the transition to a low-carbon economy may bring about behavioral changes among consumers, such as a shift toward smaller or more energy-efficient vehicles or toward shared mobility, more quickly than anticipated. A mismatch between the product/service offering and consumer expectations would expose the Group to a decline in revenues.
REPUTATIONAL RISKS. 
Environmental issues (carbon footprint reduction and impact on air quality) are a concern for all stakeholders (employees, NGOs, users, etc.) A mismatch between the Group’s product/service offering and environmental requirements could harm its brand image and negatively influence customer purchasing decisions, leading to a decline in revenues. It could also make the Group less attractive to suppliers.
A strong environmental reputation also contributes to attracting talent and increasing employee pride in belonging to the Group. A mismatch could affect employee engagement.
WORKFORCE RISKS The accelerated pace of technological change will create a need to update know-how by investing in training and acquiring new skills.

EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS/NATURAL DISASTERS. 
Some extreme weather events may disrupt or, in more serious cases, temporarily interrupt the activity of a number of the Group’s production and logistics facilities. An increased frequency or intensity of floods, hurricanes or droughts, combined with higher temperatures and sea levels, can push up risk prevention and maintenance costs, as well as insurance premiums.
RESOURCE SCARCITY. 
The increasing scarcity of some natural resources, such as water, may directly impact the automotive industry. It may oblige the Group to make investments to reduce its consumption or pay financial compensation to residents living near production facilities or to local communities.
Furthermore, the use of new raw materials such as cobalt may generate upward price pressure, as sales of electrified vehicles steadily grow.
STRUCTURAL GEOGRAPHIC AND GEOPOLITICAL CHANGES. 
Climate change may lead to structural and geopolitical changes in certain regions. Because the Group has many sites around the world, this could directly impact its activity. Instability in one region or country could require the Group to adjust its industrial strategy.
Regional and geopolitical instability can also create weaknesses in the supply chain ecosystem and oblige the Group to reorganize its value chain, pushing up purchase costs.
SPREAD OF DISEASES. 
By forcing the shutdown of production facilities or sales outlets, epidemics and pandemics can have a direct impact on sales and manufacturing, and therefore on revenues.

DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND ACCESSING NEW MARKETS. 
Combined with evolving CO2, emissions regulations, new consumer preferences for lower-carbon-emissions products are a major opportunity to develop new products and enter new markets. As a frontrunner in electric mobility and a leading developer of hybrid technologies and complementary solutions such as fuel cells, Renault Group is well-poised to take advantage of these trends. The Group adapts the skills of the workforce by putting in place training sessions about new technology and bolsters its electric vehicle manufacturing capacity with the creation of an "Electro pole" in France.
BUILDING UP THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY OF MOBILITY. 
Building up the circular economy is not only a core driver of carbon neutrality for the Group, it also underpins the Group’s development of new products and services, especially through its new Mobilize business unit. By contributing to the circular economy, the Group will meet the needs of consumers who want to switch to more sustainable forms of mobility and, at the same time, extend the life cycle of its products.
PRODUCING ENERGY FOR OWN USE AT SITES. 
To meet carbon footprint reduction targets, the Group must adjust its industrial processes and roll out low-carbon technologies in the short and medium terms. In addition to improving the environmental performance of its production facilities, the Group can use this opportunity to reduce its energy bill and its exposure to future increases in fossil fuel prices.
STRENGTHENING OUR REPUTATION AS A CLIMATE CHANGE LEADER. 
Renault Group’s efforts to integrate climate change issues into its strategy are an opportunity to strengthen its reputation as a pacesetter in this area. The Group is the first carmaker to have its greenhouse gas reduction targets validated by the Science Based Targets initiative. It is one of the top three out of the 30 automotive sector companies in the ranking by the World Benchmarking Alliance and CDP published in December 2020. This ranking assesses “how companies integrate climate issues into their strategy, their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the quality of their management of these emissions”. Renault is also one of the five companies among those ranked whose GHG reduction targets meet the Paris Agreement alignment criteria established by the International Energy Agency. Although it has already established a positive reputation in this area, the Group’s continued efforts to uphold and deepen its commitments can help strengthen the confidence of its stakeholders.

ON THE ROAD TO CARBON NEUTRALITY


F ollowing the signing of the Paris Climate Agreement (COP 21) in 2015, the Group’s product plan and strategy were redesigned to ensure its contribution to limiting global warming to well below 2°C. This central trajectory underpins the Renaulution strategic plan. An analysis of alternative climate scenarios was also conducted to inform the. 
Group’s risk management strategy up to 2050, with intermediate milestones in 2030 and 2040:
NEW GREEN DEAL ECO-TECHNO DRIVEN RETREAT AND FRAGMENTATION 1.5°C 3°C 4°C. 
SCENARIO DESCRIPTION. 
In this scenario, the raised awareness of climate risk by all stakeholders around the world (governments, financial institutions and citizen-consumers) drives more sustainable regulations, business models and lifestyles. This scenario is enabled by worldwide public-private collaborations. The main emitting industries participate fully in the transition to a low-carbon economy. Through efficient coordination with legislators and robust planning at a global level, new technologies to respond to climate change are developed. This systemic approach to mobility paves the way for the growth of efficient, multimodal services.
In this scenario, the most developed regions maintain worldwide growth. These regions succeed in combining low local levels of emissions with climate-focused economic expansion, through the development of new technologies (including mobility services). Despite this, the lack of worldwide commitment and of coordinated climate policy lead to global warming of about 3°C, whose physical impacts affect all populations. Carmakers are faced with a wide diversity of usages and demand from one region to another.
Global governance and technologies are lacking, leading to a general economic decline and a retreat from globalization in the aftermath of climate, economic and political crises. Physical risks such as floods, fires and droughts become frequent and uncontrollable, leading to population migration and wider inequalities. Low-tech and low-cost become the norm, including in mobility, and long-distance travel is discouraged.

Since 2017, climate scenario analysis has been an integral part of the Group’s strategic thinking. These analyses are based on external benchmark data, in particular: a World Automotive Powertrain Outlook, used by the French automotive industry platform (PFA); a 1.5TECH and 1.5LIFE scenarios presented by the European. 
Commission on November 28, 2018; a Energy Technology Perspectives, published by the. 
International Energy Agency (the B2DS, or “Beyond 2°C” scenario).
In 2020, in alignment with the TCFD’s recommendations, the Group expanded and deepened its analysis of climate scenarios and the implications of climate risks on its short-, medium- and long-term performance. The three climate scenarios described above were based on this work and on internal scenarios constructed by the R&D and Strategy departments.—

EMBEDDING RESILIENCE IN OUR RENAULUTION STRATEGIC PLAN. 
DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, SERVICES. 
AND BRANDS (ACTIONS #1, #2, #3 AND #5)
As a frontrunner in electric mobility and a major developer of hybrid technologies and complementary solutions such as hydrogen fuel cells, Renault Group invests about €2.3 billion in R&D every year. The majority of these resources is allocated to the development of new low-emissions vehicles, powertrains and batteries. R&D activities support the Group’s goal to launch only all electric or hybrid vehicles under the Renault brand by 2025 (Action #1) and to accelerate the deployment of higher performing, low-carbon and reusable batteries (Action #5). Upstream of vehicle projects, between €100 million and €150 million are allocated each year to research and advanced engineering. A significant share of this spending is earmarked for innovations that are specifically aimed at reducing vehicle emissions (by extending the electric vehicle range), which is a regulatory need, particularly in Europe. Another share is allocated to developing battery services (second-life use and smart charging). These initiatives enhance product attractiveness and are a major factor in reducing Renault’s environmental footprint.
The creation of an "Electro pole" in northern France, which was announced in January 2021, will build the Group’s largest electric vehicle manufacturing capacity in the world and further reinforce its competitive edge in this sector.
In electric vehicles, the Group has a decade of experience in design, manufacturing, sales and aftersales, as well as a force of 30,000 employees who have been trained in the specific features of these vehicles. With ZOE, KANGOO Z.E. and. 
MASTER Z.E., as well as TWINGO Z.E. and Dacia SPRING since 2020, it has a comprehensive range of electric vehicles on offer in many countries.
The Group also offers hybrid and plug-in hybrid technologies (Action #3), with E-TECH Hybrid for CLIO and. 
E-TECH Plug-in Hybrid for Renault MEGANE, CAPTUR and. 
ARKANA. It plans to deploy natural gas and LPG technologies in. 
Europe and internationally.
Renault is also offering new, complementary solutions based on alternative energies, such as hydrogen fuel cells to equip light commercial vehicles (KANGOO Z.E. HYDROGEN). To reach its goal of leadership in hydrogen-powered light commercial vehicles in Europe by 2025 (Action #2), Renault plans to partner with a North American company, Plug Power, the global leader in fuel cell systems and hydrogen-related services. Through an R&D and manufacturing joint venture created in France, the partnership aims to offer turnkey solutions that include decarbonized hydrogen delivery and refueling stations along with fuel cell-powered light commercial vehicles.
ELECTRIC AND SHARED MOBILITY SERVICES (ACTION #4)
Increasing demand for alternatives to personal cars is driving the development of new mobility solutions aligned with the global decarbonization strategy.
At the start of 2021, Renault Group launched the. 
Mobilize business unit for sustainable mobility. These new services aim to increase the amount of time a vehicle is actually in use (currently 10%), improve the management of residual value by implementing circular economy principles, and support the Group’s ambition to achieve carbon neutrality.
The new brand will launch four purpose-designed models for shared mobility in city centers by 2025.
Mobilize will fulfill new mobility needs. For example, it will offer ride-hailing, car sharing, last-mile delivery and on-demand transit. Vehicle use will be charged on a time or mileage basis. Mobilize will also develop an energy ecosystem including facilitated access to charging infrastructure, smart charging solutions, energy storage and battery life cycle management.

BUILDING UP THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY (ACTION #7)
Developing the circular economy plays a pivotal role in reducing Renault’s carbon footprint. At the start of 2021, the Group announced the rollout of the Re-Factory plant in Flins, France, which is wholly dedicated to the circular economy. It is structured around four areas of activity: Re-Trofit (extending the life of vehicles), Re-Energy (producing, storing and managing renewable energy),
Re-Cycle (optimizing the management of resources) and. 
Re-Start (making innovation accessible to all). The plant transformation plan will be carried out in phases between 2021 and 2024. At the same time, an assessment of the emissions avoided by the new areas of activity to 2030 will be performed.
PRODUCING ENERGY FOR OWN USE AT SITES (ACTION #8)
The Group’s objective is to halve its sites’ emissions by 2030 compared to 2019 by adapting industrial processes and using low-carbon energy. In addition to improving the environmental performance of its production facilities, these steps will help to reduce the Group’s overall energy bill. The model factory in Tangier, Morocco, is equipped with a biomass boiler fueled with local agricultural by-products (olive waste and crushed wood from packaging used at the plant, for example). It is also powered by locally produced, renewable electricity, which covers 92% of its energy needs and avoids more than 100,000 metric tons of CO2e emissions per year. The. 
Group has announced the goal of using 70% renewable energy at all its sites by 2030.
Additionally, incentives offered by governments to promote solar power enabled the Group to undertake large projects to install photovoltaic panels at six French plants, three Spanish plants and the Group’s South Korean plant, in tandem with financial and technical organizations.
The solar panels installed on Renault sites in. 
France, Spain and South Korea cover a total surface area of 86 hectares, or the equivalent of nearly 120 soccer fields.
In 2020, the 94 MW of fully renewable electricity that they generate enabled the prevention of more than 30,000 metric tons of CO2e emissions. In addition to these environmental benefits, with this project, Renault Group was able to protect a large expanse of newly built vehicle storage areas from the risk of hail. This alone represented a cost saving of several million euros.
IMPLEMENTING TOOLS AND PROCESSES TO MANAGE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES. 
MONITORING THE REDUCTION OF CO2E VEHICLE. 
EMISSIONS. 
In 2018, the Group created a specific program team, called the CAFE Control Tower, to monitor emissions reduction and adjust the road map to 2022. Starting in 2019, the Group also developed a tool to forecast CO2 levels for its registered vehicles in Europe. The CAFE Control Tower reports its results to the Board of Management (BoM) every month.
Outside Europe, the Group must meet similar regulatory constraints. In total, around 70% of the Group’s sales worldwide are subject to CAFE-type regulations. The strategy and organization described above enabled the Group to achieve its CAFE targets for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in 2020.
CO2e vehicle emissions are also closely monitored via the global carbon footprint KPI. In addition, specific targets are set to ensure that products are competitive in terms of fuel consumption and CO2e emissions. The BoM reviews these indicators each year to ensure their alignment with short-, medium- and long-term strategy.

MAKING STRATEGIC CHOICES TO MANAGE GHG. 
EMISSIONS REDUCTION. 
The Group uses an internal carbon pricing (ICP) mechanism to drive the reduction in its CO2e emissions and internalize the economic cost of its greenhouse gas emissions.
This internal price depends on the scope being considered: a For vehicle projects, the ICP notably takes into account regulations on emissions in use, such as CAFE, and CO2- related taxation. In Europe, the carbon price is around €450/metric ton; a For industrial installations, the ICP takes into account multiple factors such as expected changes in the energy market and CO2e emissions quotas: over half of the. 
Group’s direct emissions are concerned by the EU-ETS quota exchange system, for which the average price in 2020 was around €25/metric ton of CO2; a For the supply of parts and materials, an ICP will be introduced in the near future.
Moreover, in the company's internal process, life cycle assessments (LCA) or carbon assessments are carried out regularly to evaluate the GHG emissions of vehicles and decide between different strategic or technological options for a region or model. These include comparative LCAs of batteries, comparisons of powertrain technologies (electric, plug-in hybrid, hydrogen, LPG, NGV and biogas) and assessing the environmental benefits brought by the circular economy.
The prevailing logic in these evaluations is that only those vehicles or services offering mobility with the lowest possible carbon footprint will be successful in the marketplace or be favored by regulations or taxation.
ENSURING SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY. 
The Group has set up a comprehensive risk management system for its entire supply chain, from design and development to production, logistics and quality, as well as economic and financial sustainability. Managing supply chain risks, which include physical climate risks, hinges on the coordinated action of several departments (supplier risk management and control and a network of financial analysts), which work closely with operational purchasing managers in the Alliance Purchasing Organization and with other potentially impacted departments (such as engineering, manufacturing and the supply chain). —

HOW THE GROUP. 
IDENTIFIES CLIMATE RISKS. 
T o meet the TCFD’s recommendations on climate-related financial disclosures, a working group was created in 2020.
Its members represent the various Group departments with strategic added value for the climate project: they include the Head of Risk Management, the Head of Financial Communications, the. 
Strategic Environmental Planning department, and several technical experts. The Climate working group identified the risks related to climate change (including transition and physical risks), built scenarios, assessed the impacts of each risk on Group performance under each scenario and developed action plans.
Its work contributed to Renault’s new strategic plan and informed the mapping of the Group’s major risks. Transition and physical climate risks were identified as triggering factors of several other risks, such as those described in the Universal registration document 2020 (section 1.5.2).
The working group’s publications were also taken into account in producing the risk analysis presented in the Extra-Financial. 
Performance Declaration. This analysis points to climate change, including the impact of changing regulations and standards governing the environmental performance of vehicles, the risks arising from the transition to a low-carbon economy and physical risks as the main risks affecting extra-financial performance.
At the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020, Renault. 
Group conducted a materiality analysis to identify and prioritize the environmental, social, societal and governance (ESG) issues it will face over the next five years. This analysis consists of comparing an internal ranking of ESG issues with an evaluation of their importance by external stakeholders, in order to identify “material” topics, which are those that will have a major impact on the Group’s ecosystem and its performance over the period under consideration and on which efforts must be focused.
This new materiality matrix updates the 2015 matrix and enables Renault Group to focus its strategy and environmental, social, societal and governance initiatives. Spearheaded by the CSR department, a cross-functional steering committee supervised the methodological approach and the key stages of the project. The new matrix was validated by the Group Executive Committee (now the. 
Board of Management) and by Jean-Dominique Senard.
As in 2015, “Reducing the total carbon footprint” and “Reducing the impact of the use of vehicles on air quality” are Renault.

HOW THE GROUP MANAGES. 
CLIMATE RISKS. 
I dentifying and managing risks relating to the environment and to climate change are a part of the. 
Group’s global risk management system, which is supervised by the Risk Management department. The risk management method it applies is based on identifying and assessing risks of any kind, which are then mapped (as mentioned earlier), and on carrying out action plans to deal with these risks, and specifically their net impact and/or probability of occurrence, by means of elimination, prevention, protection or transfer.
Risk management policy is applied at Group level for major risks. It is also rolled out at operating entity level (countries, commercial and/or industrial subsidiaries), for vehicle programs and for global functions.
 a Level 1 – Group level. The Risk Management department provides an overall view of major risks.
Transition and physical climate risks are included in this risk map, not as distinct risks, but as the triggering or aggravating factors of several other risks. The identification and management of climate risks are therefore fully integrated into the Group’s global risk management system.
Under the supervision of the Board of Management (BoM) and the Board of Directors (mainly through two of its specialized committees – Risks and Internal Control, and Audit, Risks and Compliance), the major risk map is updated annually. These updates are closely coordinated with the development of the medium-term strategic plan and its rollout, so that it can include targeted action plans to address operational and strategic risks. The mapping of the Group’s major risks is presented in the Universal registration document 2020.
a Level 2 – Operating department level. Operating departments are in charge of managing major risks, which include climate risks. Each major risk is assigned to a “risk owner”, a member of the BoM who handles the management of the risk with their teams and reports on their work to the BoM. For example, the Group’s. 
Prevention and Protection department is in charge of identifying and addressing the risks and opportunities relating to protecting assets from physical risks (such as severe weather events) and to follow up on risk prevention audits with insurers. Risks that relate more specifically to the transition to a low-carbon economy are supervised by the Strategic Environmental Planning department, with the support of the external affairs, manufacturing and logistics departments. These risks are reported on annually to the BoM, which approves the corresponding management strategy and the necessary means to implement it.
a Level 3 – Entity level. In all entities involved in business- critical processes, experts are appointed to identify and prioritize risk management solutions and related local opportunities and to oversee their implementation. They directly contribute to the Group’s major risk mapping and management process.—

MONITORING TARGETS − LIFE CYCLE. 
ASSESSMENT. 
METRICS AND TARGETS 50. 
S ince 2005, Renault Group has taken action to reduce the environmental impact of its vehicles throughout their life cycle, from one generation to the next.
To ensure that it meets its goals and to monitor its progress, the Group began in 2004 to measure its vehicles’ impact on the environment (and the potential impact on global warming), starting from the extraction of the raw materials needed for their manufacture and until their end of life.
Life cycle assessments (LCA) are therefore performed: a prior to the vehicle design process, to analyze the potential environmental impact and benefits of technological innovations; a after the design process, to confirm and measure the reduction of environmental impacts from one generation of vehicle to another.
At end-2020, 28 models representing nearly 80% of the Group’s global passenger car sales under the Renault, Dacia,
Alpine and RSM (Renault Samsung Motors) brands were thus subjected to a complete LCA. Starting with the launch of TWINGO. 
III in September 2014, all new models undergo a comparative LCA with respect to their predecessor. Each of these LCAs is critically reviewed by an independent expert following the ISO 14040 and 14044 standards, to evaluate, firstly, the methodology used and, secondly, all of the calculations and interpretations made.
The LCA reports for new models, together with their reviews, are published online at group.renault.com/en/our-commitments.
The following chart compares LCAs to show the potential impact on climate change of ZOE versus CLIO. It illustrates how electric vehicles can effectively help fight climate change.—
POTENTIAL IMPACT ON CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE LIFE CYCLE OF ZOE (VS. CLIO):
The above chart presents the results of the comparative life cycle assessment of new ZOE (2019) and CLIO V (2019), in the form of a comparison by normalization. Normalization consists of measuring the relative weight of the vehicle studied in relation to the environmental impact of an “average” European citizen over a reference year. The results of the LCA illustrate the pertinence of electric vehicles in the fight against global warming: over the entire life cycle, the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions stands at 28% for ZOE compared with CLIO V, based on an average European electricity mix for battery recharging. With the electricity mix in France, the reduction was 64%. Indicators whose relative weight in the normalization is lower are nonetheless useful for identifying and prioritizing the actions to be taken to reduce environmental impacts. Thus, the indicator of potential depletion of mineral resources shows a negative impact related to the manufacture of the electric vehicle traction battery. To meet this challenge, the Group is leveraging various options: maximizing battery use (smart charging, bidirectional charging, second-life uses such as stationary energy storage) and participating in the development of new recycling solutions for active battery materials, thereby helping reduce the need for virgin materials.

GLOSSARY. 
RENAULT GROUP. 
B Biogas: a “green” gas produced by the decomposition of organic matter in an oxygen-free environment. Before it can be used as a fuel in vehicles, biogas must be refined to remove certain elements (carbon dioxide, water vapor and hydrogen sulphide), resulting in biomethane, which is nearly identical to NGV. Biomass: the energy stored in biomass can produce electricity, using the heat from the combustion or fermentation of matter such as wood, plants, agricultural residues and organic waste.
C Carbon footprint: a measure of the greenhouse gas emissions generated by human activities. The potential impact of these emissions on global warming is expressed in terms of CO2 equivalent, abbreviated as “CO2e”. Carbon-free energy: energy that does not generate carbon dioxide emissions during its production, unlike energy produced from burning coal. Renewable energies and nuclear energy are considered to be carbon-free. CDP: formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project, CDP is a not-for-profit organization that publishes yearly information on the environmental impact of leading companies. These disclosures are obtained from three questionnaires; the one on climate change is the most frequently used. CMF: the Common Module Family is a technology-sharing concept applied to a series of vehicle platforms common to both Renault and Nissan. Using modular architecture principles, it enables a wide range of vehicles to be built using a limited set of parts.
E Eco-design: eco-design incorporates environmental considerations into a product’s design from the very start, in order to improve its environmental performance.
Energy mix: the combination of various primary energy sources used in a given geographic region or organization (country, city, industry, etc.). It includes fossil fuels, nuclear power and renewable energies.
F Fuel cell: in a fuel cell, hydrogen and oxygen combined to form water, while releasing electricity and heat. This electricity is used to power a vehicle’s electric motor.
G GHG: greenhouse gases occurring naturally in the atmosphere. Two of the main greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Higher concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are a direct cause of global warming. Greenhouse Gas Protocol: the GHG Protocol is the organization that develops international standards for measuring carbon footprints. It is the world's most widely used accounting framework for understanding, quantifying and managing greenhouse gas emissions.
H Hybrid: a hybrid vehicle uses two forms of propulsion: an internal combustion engine (usually gasoline-powered) and an electric motor.
I IEA: the International Energy Agency is an intergovernmental organisation established within the OECD and made up of some 30 member countries, mainly oil-importing. Its missions include ensuring energy supply security, coordinating the energy policies of its member countries and supporting and raising awareness of the reforms needed to address climate change. Each year, the IEA publishes research, such as the “World Energy Outlook”, which provides an overview of the energy industry. IPCC: the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is an organization of governments, created in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme. Its scientists provide regular assessments of the current knowledge on climate change, its causes, impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation.
L LPG: liquefied petroleum gas is a mixture of propane and butane. About 40% of LPG comes from oil refining and 60% from the processing of natural gas.
N NGV: natural gas for vehicles is a naturally occurring gas made up primarily of methane and used as fuel. It can be found in different forms: compressed (CNG) or liquid (LNG).
R Renewable energies: energies generated from natural and continuously replenished resources, such as sunlight, wind, water and matter from living animals and plants. Renewable energies include solar power, wind power, hydraulic power, geothermal energy and biomass energy.
S SBTi: the Science Based Targets initiative is a partnership between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). It helps companies to determine their CO2 emissions reduction trajectories in order to keep global warming below 2°C. Stationary battery storage: systems designed to store electricity, usually generated by renewable energy, in batteries. These systems can then deliver the electricity on demand.
T Tank-to-wheel: CO2 emissions while the vehicle is in use. Also called “exhaust emissions”.
V Vehicle to grid (V2G): bidirectional technology enabling the charging of battery electric vehicles (BEV), plugin hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) as well as the return of electricity back to the grid.
W Waste recovery: transformation of waste that could not be recycled into another product or energy source. WLTP: Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure. In the vehicle approval process, WLTP is the procedure for measuring pollutant consumption and emissions under conditions more representative of customer use and the diverse nature of vehicle equipment. This test procedure is supplemented by road tests that use the new Real Driving Emissions (RDE) protocol.
