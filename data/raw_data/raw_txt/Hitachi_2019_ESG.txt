CEO’s Message. 
Resolving Social Issues and Improving Quality of Life Through Social Innovations. 
We are today going through an era of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA) in which the future of society and economy is becoming increasingly difficult to predict. Our lives are being affected by many sweeping changes, such as shifting demographics from urbanization and aging, climate change, and resource shortages. This has heightened expectations worldwide for private businesses, which are the drivers of innovation, to make a bigger contribution to the resolution of society’s issues and the achievement of Society 5.0 and the. 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). There is growing global demand, in particular, for intelligent social infrastructure using digital technology—a need that. 
Hitachi is well-positioned to meet.
In the VUCA era, we believe it is all the more important for us at Hitachi to reembrace our Corporate Credo: to contribute to society through the development of superior, original technology and products. This philosophy has remained at the heart of our operations over the 109 years since our founding, and it informs the Hitachi Group Vision to become a company that “delivers innovation that answer society’s challenges.” As a global leader with business operations worldwide, we believe it is our mission to contribute to the resolution of social issues and achievement of the SDGs by accelerating our Social Innovation Business.

Our 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, announced in May 2019, outlines our aim to help bring about a sustainable society through our global leadership in the Social. 
Innovation Business, simultaneously increasing social, environmental, and economic value, improving people’s quality of life, and enhancing value for our customers. We seek to improve people’s lives by providing intelligent social infrastructure globally through our digital solutions. The sources of our strength in these areas are our operational technology (OT) accumulated over a century of developing monozukuri excellence— starting with the five-horsepower induction motor—and our IT skills honed over the past 50 years. We can contribute to the solution of various problems facing society with our OT, IT, and high-quality products.
Among the issues facing contemporary society, climate change is regarded as being one of the most important, as reflected in the goal set in our Mid-term. 
Management Plan of raising environmental value. Roughly 90% of CO2 emissions from. 
Hitachi’s value chain come from the use of our products and services. We thus have a responsibility to help achieve a low-carbon society by prioritizing our decarbonization business, which seeks to provide more value to customers and society while using less energy.
When people hear the name Hitachi, I would like everyone to associate us with being an innovation partner. This will require that we accelerate our collaborative creation with a full range of stakeholders worldwide and to construct an “innovation ecosystem” with them.
For instance, in addressing social issues to help achieve the SDGs, we will strengthen our efforts to cultivate the “seeds” of innovation into new ideas ready for implementation through collaborative creation with universities, open innovation at “Kyōsō-no-Mori” of Hitachi’s Central Research Laboratory, and venture capital investment.
Human capital is another key driver of our Social Innovation Business, and I believe it is extremely important for our employees to have an awareness in their work that all businesses relating directly to social infrastructure can be seen as contributions to society. Human capital is an important component of our efforts to create social value.
In striving to achieve our goals for the medium and long term, I would like for all our employees to consider the kind of value we can provide not only to our customers but also to society so that we may make an even bigger contribution through the provision of social, environmental, and economic value.

Executive Officer’s Message: CSR and the Environment. 
Integrating Sustainability Initiatives into Our Management Strategy. 
The risks we face from such factors as climate change and a global population explosion have grown to unprecedented levels in recent years and are threatening the sustainability of our way of life. Since the European Union announced an action plan in 2015 to accelerate its transition to a circular economy, in which growth is achieved through the effective use of resources, companies have increasingly been called to shift to sustainable business models. They are being asked to address social issues and help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through their main business activities, while also integrating sustainability initiatives into their management and business strategies.
Since its founding, Hitachi has had a Corporate Credo of contributing to society through the development of superior, original technology and products, and this has remained at the heart of its operations. Sustainability has been a primary consideration in our management, as we have sought to contribute to a sustainable society through our Social Innovation Business. We will further pursue sustainability management going forward and strive to continually enhance our corporate value in response to global trends.
Our 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, announced in May 2019, outlines a goal of contributing to the realization of a sustainable world by simultaneously increasing social, environmental, and economic value. Toward this end, we must regard sustainability as a management issue and strengthen our governance.
In 2017, we thus created the Executive Sustainability Committee chaired by the president and CEO of Hitachi, Ltd. and comprising other members of the Senior.

Executive Committee, along with the CEOs of every business unit, to discuss and reach decisions on the Group’s sustainability strategy as a key management and business issue. The topics discussed at the Executive Sustainability Committee meeting in June 2018 included integrating our sustainability strategy into the 2021 Mid-term. 
Management Plan to respond to climate change and to help achieve the SDGs through our business activities. Deliberations at the December 2018 meeting focused on expanding our decarbonization business and introducing the Hitachi Internal Carbon. 
Pricing (HICP) system as specific approaches to achieving our long-term environmental targets (for CO2 reduction). Other issues discussed included corporate measures that are the foundations of management, such as human rights, CSR procurement, and the development of human capital; sustainability-related stakeholder engagement; and. 
Hitachi’s disclosure policy on ESG information.
Climate change is a priority management issue for us at Hitachi, and we are striving to reduce CO2 emissions throughout our value chain. We announced our long-term environmental targets called Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 in fiscal 2016 that includes a CO2 reduction target of 80% throughout the value chain by fiscal 2050 (compared to fiscal 2010). To achieve a resource efficient society, we are responding to the issue of water scarcity and promoting the efficient use of water and other resources. We are also promoting the effective use of plastic and other resources to minimize our impact on natural capital to achieve a harmonized society with nature.
In response to growing calls in recent years from investors and other stakeholders for climate-related disclosures, we are advancing our efforts in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In fiscal 2018, we participated in the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry’s TCFD Study Group on. 
Implementing TCFD Recommendations for Mobilizing Green Finance Through Proactive. 
Corporate Disclosures, which brought together private businesses and financial institutions for discussions on the development of guidelines on climate-related financial disclosures (TCFD Guidance) in promoting constructive dialogue between global corporations and investors.
This report outlines our strategies for climate-related risks and opportunities based on these TCFD discussions. It also contains detailed information on our ESG-related activities, which I hope will be pertinent to our readers.
We will continue to pursue sustained growth for both society and our company through dialogue with and proactive information disclosure to our stakeholders.

The 2021 Mid-term Management Plan and Sustainability Policy. 
Since its founding, Hitachi has responded to social challenges by placing its Corporate Credo of contributing to society through the development of superior, original technologies and products at the center of its business. In recent years, we have promoted our Social Innovation Business in order to contribute to improving people’s quality of life and realizing a sustainable society.

We strive to simultaneously increase social, environmental, and economic value, as well as enhance our customers’ corporate value and the peoples’ quality of life.
With our 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, we have advanced to a new stage, identifying five sectors where we can increase social, environmental, and economic value for our customers simultaneously: mobility, smart life, industry, energy, and IT. In order to increase the three kinds of value simultaneously, we will expand our Social Innovation Business through collaborative creation with our partners around the world by providing Lumada, a solution that accelerates digital innovation, as a cyber-physical system allowing the cyber and physical spaces to interact.
Based on these ideas, we continue to pursue the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, further merging sustainability and business to contribute to the resolution of social issues through initiatives like Society 5.0 and Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs).

Executive Sustainability Committee Meetings. 
In fiscal 2018, the Executive Sustainability Committee held meetings in June and December.
At the June meeting, our response to climate change and the integration of our sustainability strategy into the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan were discussed. The focus was on how business units and key Group companies should link their operations to the SDGs in terms of business opportunities and risks, as well as how Hitachi should respond to risks and social demands around climate change. We also reviewed ESG, SDGs, and other sustainability initiatives to be incorporated into the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan.
At the December meeting, as part of our countermeasures against climate change, we discussed the expansion of our decarbonization business and introduction of the Hitachi Internal. 
Carbon Pricing (HICP) system as specific approaches to achieving our long-term environmental targets (for CO2 reduction). We also discussed corporate measures that are the foundations of management, like human rights, CSR procurement, and the development of human capital; sustainability-related stakeholder engagement; and specific information disclosure requirements.
Contribution to SDGs Policy. 
SDGs and Hitachi’s Social Innovation Business. 
We consider the SDGs an important initiative for realizing a sustainable society and improving people’s quality of life through solving global social and environmental issues. We have significantly contributed to achieving the SDGs through our Social Innovation Business, which also serves as a source of sustainable growth for us.
Accordingly, through the provision of innovative solutions and products in our Social Innovation. 
Business, we will strive to create social, environmental, and economic value as part of our management strategy. We will also strive to reduce negative social and environmental impacts resulting from our business and seek a deeper understanding of business risks arising from social and environmental changes to ensure greater robustness against them.
By proactively responding to social issues, Hitachi contributes to the achievement of all SDGs through its responsible corporate conduct and its Social Innovation Business.
Hitachi contributes to the achievement of all SDGs both directly and indirectly through its business activities.

Identifying How Hitachi Can Contribute to the SDGs. 
In fiscal 2017 Executive Sustainability Committee meetings chaired by President and CEO. 
Toshiaki Higashihara, the committee members considered the 17 SDGs, and the opportunities and risks they represented, and identified 11 Goals to the achievement of which Hitachi can make a particularly significant contribution: 5 Goals where we can make significant impact through our key business strategies, and 6 additional Goals that we must contribute to through our entire corporate activities. We view the latter 6 Goals as relevant to our entire business and management strategies, making an impact on corporate sustainability.
Because we are active in a broad range of business fields, we believe we can contribute extensively to the achievement of the SDGs other than the 11 Goals identified. Understanding that all SDGs are mutually related, we will endeavor to contribute to the achievement of all 17. 
SDGs both directly and indirectly.
Road Map for Achieving the SDGs. 
Developing a sustainable society as defined by the SDGs will lead to sustainable growth for. 
Hitachi, too. We believe that we are providing value not only to the companies and consumers that are our direct customers but also to society more broadly. This is the essence of our Social. 
Innovation Business. The products and services that we provide are all closely linked to social sustainability, and we aim to establish a global position as a business-to-society (B2S) company through our efforts to help achieve the SDGs.
In fiscal 2017, we officially launched strategic initiatives for achieving the SDGs. In phase 1, as part of our initiatives to help deepen understanding across the Hitachi Group of sustainability and the SDGs, sustainability workshops were held individually for four business units: Water,
Energy Solutions, Healthcare, and Railway Systems. Sustainability newsletters were also issued in an effort to promote understanding and awareness of our SDG initiatives. In phase 2, our. 
Sustainability Promotion Division worked with the planning divisions of business units and key. 
Group companies to clarify how each could contribute to the achievement of the SDGs through their key businesses and create business opportunities from the SDGs.
In phase 3, starting in fiscal 2018, Hitachi started seeking new business opportunities emerging from social challenges addressed by the SDGs. Specifically, we clarified how each business unit and key Group company should link their Social Innovation Business to the SDGs and set quantitative KPIs, wherever possible, for the social and environmental value they created to help visualize improvements.
In fiscal 2019, we launched an initiative exploring ways to build a framework for assessing social and environmental impacts brought about by business activities, in order to make our efforts to create social and environmental value closely linked to the SDGs more appealing to our customers and society in a concrete manner. Moving forward, we will develop an impact assessment approach with reference to key businesses outlined in the 2021 Mid-term. 
Management Plan, thereby establishing an impact evaluation framework for social and environmental value that can be used across the entire Group.
This approach will enable us to offer more sustainable business options to our customers based on consideration of the positive and negative social and environmental impacts of our business activities. In this way, we will realize the three kinds of value outlined in the 2021.

Framework for Promoting Engagement Frameworks and Systems. 
The outcomes of communication with stakeholders are shared with respective divisions and actively utilized as valuable insights into our business. Public interest is growing in how corporations are taking in stakeholders’ voices to improve their businesses, and we will continue to globally develop and promote ways of capitalizing on the opinions of the members of society with whom we engage in our business activities.
Working with Governments and Policy Frameworks and Systems Public Policymakers Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
Hitachi’s Approach to External Relations Initiatives. 
We believe that it is governments that are best positioned to both understand and work to resolve social issues, whether at the national or regional level. As we develop our Social Innovation. 
Business on a global scale, our activities in the social infrastructure field are particularly intertwined with the public interest. This makes government institutions and related organizations in Japan and other countries around the world important partners to Hitachi both as customers and as backers.
Today’s global community urgently requires solutions for a range of social issues related to the environment, energy, aging societies, and urbanization. At the same time, innovation in the fields of internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI)—the so-called fourth industrial revolution— is advancing rapidly. Like the Japanese government and its “Super Smart Society” (Society 5.0) proposal, governments around the world are expanding their support systems in response to these developments. For Hitachi, promoting our business according to legislative policies and making effective use of governmental advice and support systems is enormously helpful to us in advancing our Social Innovation Business. We also increasingly receive requests for proposals from the Japanese government as they seek to identify solutions for social issues and craft infrastructure support policies to resolve unique regional challenges. Assisting with these requests, whether directly or through participation in an economic organization or industrial body, is one way Hitachi contributes to a better society.

*1 Communications and Information Network Association of Japan (CIAJ): A major ICT industry association consisting of manufacturers of communication network devices and terminals, communication operators, service providers, and user companies.
Framework for Promoting External Relations. 
Hitachi established the Government & External Relations Division in our corporate headquarters in fiscal 2009 to guide and accelerate the external relations of the entire Hitachi Group, and we have since worked to strengthen our relationships with government and industrial organizations.
In fiscal 2018, we established the Government & External Relations Group by integrating this division with the Sustainability Promotion Division to achieve our new goals of further enhancing the global expansion of our Social Innovation Business in terms of external relations.
The Government & External Relations Group is not only active in Japan but also works with the Hitachi Corporate Office in Washington DC, the Hitachi Corporate Office, Europe, and other business locations in the Americas, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific. By dealing with governments and organizations as a unified Group in seeking mutual benefit with the communities we participate in, we explore new business opportunities for Hitachi in each community’s unique social issues and policies.
Policy Council Participation. 
As part of our dialogue with government officials, Hitachi executives and other representatives participate in a range of government-sponsored policy councils. We are particularly active in the discussion of how best to realize “Society 5.0” advocated by the Japanese government, exploring ways to simultaneously resolve social issues and achieve economic growth. Executive. 
Chairman Nakanishi has been a member of the governmental Council on Investments for the Future since its first meeting in September 2016. The council is a command post for the government’s growth strategy, chaired by the prime minister of Japan.

The government’s growth strategy, Investments for the Future Strategy, formulated based on discussions at the Council on Investment for the Future, outlines policies toward realizing “Society 5.0.”
Staff and senior management from the Hitachi headquarters and business departments have also participated in meetings and roundtable discussions that look into policy from the standpoint of expanding businesses, as well as cooperating in planning new policies for Japan, including specific recommendations for more effective policy planning and implementation. For example,
Hidenobu Nakahata, senior vice president and executive officer, is a member of the 2050.

Participating in Business and Industry Associations. 
Membership in business and industry associations is another critical aspect of our external relations. Hitachi is a member of Keidanren, where Executive Chairman Nakanishi was appointed chair in May 2018. Other executives and employees also participate in major Keidanren committees.
As the planning and coordination chair for the subcommittee on Europe, we also maintain close economic relations with European governments and economic organizations. In relation to the. 
United Kingdom’s decision to withdraw from the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit,” we have been communicating with both the United Kingdom and the European Union to continue maintaining stable business environment in the region as before.
President Higashihara serves as vice chair of the Japan Electronics and Information Technology. 
Industries Association (JEITA), whose mission is to achieve Society 5.0, including through the promotion of Connected Industries, and thereby optimize society as a whole. As a corporate member of the association, Hitachi has been active in various committees and working groups, examining and making proposals on the promotion of IT and data utilization, working on elementary and secondary education issues while arranging for lectures at universities and other advanced educational institutions, and offering insights into paradigms of international legislation and agreements in the era of global business.
As a member of the Japan Electrical Manufacturers’ Association (JEMA), Hitachi is committed to sustainable development of the electric machinery industry and contribution to a low-carbon society. To that end, we are working on various initiatives, including promotion of infrastructure systems exports, study of the impact of electric-power system reforms on the electric machinery industry and new business trends, improvement in the efficiency of industrial system devices, and promotion of the use of electricity storage systems, as well as actively communicating our views by participating in many committees and working groups.
United States: Hitachi Corporate Office in Washington DC. 
The Hitachi Corporate Office in Washington DC has three missions: (1) Enhancing Hitachi’s presence in the United States; (2) Contributing to the growth of business in the United States; and (3) Gathering and analyzing geopolitical intelligence. The North American market plays an important part in our business, accounting for 13% of our total revenue and more than 21,000 employees. The US political and economic climate has been rapidly changing in recent years, significantly impacting our business globally. We must monitor these changes closely in order to make critical business decisions, not just for the US but for other markets as well. Building reliable relationships and networks with influential leaders and experts including government representatives in the United States and enhancing our presence in those circles provide valuable feedback for our management and an emergency safety net.
As part of our efforts to expand our Social Innovation Business, the Hitachi Corporate Office in. 
Washington DC is engaging in dialogue with and lobbying US government representatives and regulatory authorities to facilitate a favorable business environment. In recent years, particular focus has been placed on establishing relationship with state-level government authorities, who have decision-making power over regional infrastructure investment plans, as well as federal government officials, by working closely with regional Hitachi Group companies. By proactively enhancing engagement in many areas, including security and trade issues, new technologies such as IoT and AI, energy policies, and infrastructure investment, the Washington office will strive not only to support Hitachi’s business growth but also to contribute to US society and the community.

Innovation Business and, in fiscal 2019 we plan to hold discussions with policymakers and other diverse stakeholders about how business can use IoT technology to help achieve SDGs and resolving social issues, examining the very place of our Social Innovation Business in society.
Through these activities Hitachi actively communicates with European stakeholders.
Asia-Pacific Region: Hitachi Asia Ltd., APAC Office. 
The Asia-Pacific region is replete with challenges in areas including the environment, energy, transportation, and healthcare that call for urgent solutions. At the same time, however, it offers a wealth of business opportunities. At Hitachi Asia, a core team made up of top-level managers from each national and regional office monitors legislative policies and legal regulations impacting businesses across the Asia-Pacific region and ensures that business activities remain suitable to each location’s individual circumstances. On matters such as trade policies and data flow issues that have cross-border implications, solutions are sought through cross-border collaboration.
The Asia-Pacific region is known for its religious, political, and economic diversity. To expand our Social Innovation Business in this region and contribute to solving the social issues it faces, cooperation with national and local governments and involvement in policymaking throughout the region, including Japan, is crucial. For this reason, we sponsor regional events like the Hitachi. 
Social Innovation Forum (HSIF) and Hitachi Young Leaders Initiative (HYLI) and endeavor to advance long-term and organic involvement in international scholarship programs through the. 
Hitachi Global Foundation as part of our strategy to raise understanding and awareness of our values and vision for the future among those involved in formulating policy.
Hitachi has long emphasized information exchange and communication between Group companies on a national basis. Starting in fiscal 2017, we brought in outside specialists as external relations advisors to strengthen our voice in regional policymaking. As One Hitachi, we will continue to seek dialogue with policymakers across a variety of forums in order to resolve social challenges through policy contributions and business.

To globally enhance the Hitachi brand, we have held the Hitachi Social Innovation Forum in locations worldwide, including Japan, the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, the Philippines, and. 
India, showcasing examples of the Social Innovation Business being conducted in each region.
Through keynote speeches, panel discussions, and exhibits, we present a wide range of stakeholders—including customers and government officials—with solutions to social issues that countries and regions around the world face today.
Engagement with Employees Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
Since fiscal 2012, we have held town hall meetings as forums for direct dialogue between senior management and employees. In fiscal 2018, President and CEO Toshiaki Higashihara attended a total of 20 town hall meetings in Japan, the United States, Thailand, India, the Philippines, and other countries. Our executive vice presidents responsible for the four focus business domains also held more than 30 town hall meetings, engaging in discussions with our employees.
Ordinary business meetings and conferences are limited in agenda, and company communications with employees via our intranet and other channels tend to be one-way. Town hall meetings, however, are forums for direct dialogue where employees can gain a real sense of the senior management’s way of thinking and what is needed for Hitachi to make the next leap forward, as well as occasions for reaching a shared understanding of the work in which everyone is involved. These interactions help drive mindset reform within Hitachi. For example, at one town hall meeting, a participant pointed out that existing structures and procedures made it difficult for junior-level staff to propose new business ideas. This ultimately led to the creation of an entirely new way for employees to make business proposals: an internal “New Ideas Contest” called “Make a Difference!”
In the town hall meetings, we believe that it is important for senior management to hear the thoughts of frontline employees and for both sides to share their awareness as they engage in dialogue on diverse topics, such as how we can grow our business.
Dialogue with Shareholders and Investors Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
Hitachi conducts extensive investor relations (IR) activities, focusing on dialogue with stakeholders, including institutional investors and analysts.
In fiscal 2018, we held quarterly financial results briefings as well as corporate strategy meetings on the progress of our 2018 Mid-term Management Plan. We also hosted the ninth consecutive annual Hitachi IR Day, where divisional management teams from each business explained their business strategies and management policies under the plan.
We held briefings on Hitachi’s R&D Group, a source of value creation, Hitachi executives visited institutional investors and analysts in North America, Europe, and Asia to explain our management strategies for mid- and long-term growth, for a combined total of around 550 meetings. We are doing our best to reflect feedback in management and operations to enhance our corporate value.
On the Hitachi IR website, we post briefing materials and videos as well as business performance and stock price trend charts in a timely manner. As part of our efforts to enhance our information disclosure, we have introduced a new responsive design to allow smartphone and tablet users to browse our website with ease.

The Information & Telecommunication Systems Segment’s Contribution to SDGs. 
In March 2019, the Systems & Services Business, a section of our Information &
Telecommunication Systems Segment, hosted a dialogue between Hitachi executives and external experts on the theme “Appreciation and Expectations Toward Hitachi Building. 
Infrastructure for a Society Where People Can Live a Safe, Secure, and Comfortable Life with. 
Digital Technologies.” The discussion, led by the CEOs of the Financial Institutions Business Unit,
Social Infrastructure Systems Business Unit, and Service & Platforms Business Unit and the CSO of the Systems and Services Business, was focused on how these three business units can promote the SDGs as part of corporate culture and connect them to business opportunities.
One external expert commented, “Each business unit’s business could positively or negatively affect society. Taking proactive steps toward the SDGs will not only contribute greatly to the sustainability of society, it could also be a growth driver for Hitachi.” Another said, “The Social. 
Infrastructure Systems Business Unit’s information platform for regional comprehensive care is an initiative contributing to resolving the issues of an aging society with a declining birthrate as well as supporting the human rights of children and the disabiled, helping achieve. 
Goal 16 of the SDGs.”
The dialogue was concluded by the following closing remarks from Hitachi: “We are committed to helping realize a sustainable society through social innovation, in accordance with our corporate mission. We will continue our efforts to raise awareness of this commitment among our employees and promote our business through collaborative cooperation along the value chain based on our policy of contributing to the SDGs.”
The stakeholder dialogue held by the Information & Telecommunication Systems Segment.
Europe: AI and the Future of Work in the EU. 
In February 2019, Hitachi organized a European stakeholder dialogue in Brussels on the responsible development of digitalization for the future of work. Facilitated by CSR Europe,*1 24 people attended, including representatives from the European Commission, International. 
Labour Organization, NGOs, academia, and the wider tech sector.
Hitachi Rail STS’s chief technology officer opened the event by outlining Hitachi’s experience of digitalization and co-creating solutions with customers. The subsequent discussion focused on the potential impacts of digitalization, providing greater understanding of the issues leaders must consider. Attendees were generally optimistic about future scenarios, but some took a more cautious view. Any approach, it was agreed, must remain human-centric. Participants also discussed how policy and smart regulation could ensure that technology is applied responsibly in the context of the future of work. The emerging themes highlighted a need for corporations to lead with strong ethical platforms, integrated and transparent decision-making, and diverse workforces to drive innovation without bias. Participants were also clear on the importance of taking a collaborative approach with multiple stakeholders, particularly employees, if business is to adapt responsibly to the rapid changes caused by digitalization. Hitachi will use the results of this dialogue to guide its internal and external engagement on the future of work.

The dialogue’s first session focused on the sub-theme “Perspectives on Balancing Growth and Sustainability,” examining sustainability reporting by listed firms and challenges in sustaining national infrastructure development programs. The second session’s sub-theme was “Opportunities for Collaboration in Different Sectors.” A senior representative from Hitachi clarified the meaning of “smart city” as human-centric rather than technology-focused, and government programs for multistakeholder collaboration were highlighted.
Participants learned about efforts by government, business and civil society in support of sustainable urbanization, and built trust to facilitate greater collaboration in future.

Unilever Australia Ltd., SunRice, Fujitsu Australia Ltd., Insurance Australia Group Ltd. (IAG),
Transurban Ltd., and National Roads and Motorists’ Association Ltd. (NRMA).
In preparation for the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan and its accompanying sustainability strategy, Hitachi Australia sought to understand how other Australian companies approach the. 
SDGs and to what extent their business strategies and targets are influenced by these global goals. Participants agreed that making SDGs central to business strategy will soon be the norm.
During the half-day discussion, participants shared insights into how to better engage employees in the development and achievement of these strategies and how to measure the outcomes and impact of planned actions.
The group also emphasized the strong need for business and government to work more closely than ever to realize the benefits of these initiatives.
The key takeaways were summarized in a report which was shared with Hitachi. 
Australia’s management and can be leveraged during further development of regional sustainability strategy.
India: The Business Contribution Toward the SDGs in India. 
Working toward developing a sustainable society, Hitachi India held the CSR India Stakeholder. 
Dialogue 2018 on October 25 in New Delhi. The event was attended by 32 external and internal stakeholders, including Hitachi Asia’s Chairman Kojin Nakakita and Hitachi India’s Managing. 
Director Bharat Kaushal.
The dialogue focused on the role of the private sector and how business can contribute to the. 
SDG agenda in India, particularly in the areas of e-Education, e-Governance, and urban transportation. Participants shared their understanding and experiences of how companies can align their way of working with the SDGs. During the discussion, the need to inculcate sustainability into one’s business model to ensure long-term impact was emphasized. It was also acknowledged that, given the size and complexity of the challenges, a collaborative approach rather than an individual effort will be required to achieve the SDGs.
Based on the key learnings from the dialogue, Hitachi will persevere in its ambitious efforts to incorporate sustainability into its business. By proactively responding to social issues, and through collaborative creation with various stakeholders, Hitachi will continue contributing to achieving the SDGs.

Advancing Our Environmental Vision and Long-Term Environmental Targets. 
Hitachi’s Corporate Credo is to “contribute to society through the development of superior, original technology and products.” We seek solutions to environmental issues, which are of serious concern to society, through our business operations and promote environmental management from a long-term perspective. Meeting society’s expectations with innovations that mitigate environmental issues also presents major business opportunities. Guided by our Environmental Vision defining our future environmental goals, in September 2016 we announced a set of long-term environmental targets called Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 aimed at achieving a low-carbon society, a resource efficient society, and a harmonized society with nature. To achieve these targets looking toward 2030 and 2050, we promote Group-wide environmental activities in line with our Environmental Action Plan that is updated every three years. We will make steady efforts to achieve the targets set forth in Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 to help resolve environmental issues and to conduct environmental management in a manner that meets the expectations of society.

The Environmental Vision and Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 Policy. 
As climate change, resource depletion, ecosystem destruction, and other environmental issues grow more serious, the responsibilities and contributions of companies are growing, given the increasing demands and expectations for reductions in the environmental burden of their business activities.
The 2013 Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that limiting global warming “below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels” would require “40 to 70% global anthropogenic GHG emissions reductions by 2050 compared to 2010.” The. 
IPCC’s 2018 Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, moreover, emphasized that many of the consequences of climate change can be averted if the increase in temperature is maintained below 1.5°C. The 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP24) held in December 2018 adopted guidelines for the implementation of the Paris Agreement, which entered into force in 2016. And in addition to climate change, such environmental issues as those involving the water supply, resources, and the ecosystem are being debated around the world.
In response to global demands for a reduced environmental burden, we created a management strategy called the Environmental Vision, which declares, “Hitachi will resolve environmental issues and achieve both a higher quality of life and a sustainable society through its Social Innovation. 
Business in collaborative creation with its stakeholders.” We have clearly stated our aim to achieve a low-carbon society, a resource efficient society, and a harmonized society with nature— the components of a sustainable society—in accordance with this Vision. To guide our efforts toward 2030 and 2050, in September 2016 we established long-term environmental targets called Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050. We are steadily promoting environmental activities to achieve these long-term goals in line with our Environmental Action Plan, which is updated every three years. Currently, we are further strengthening our environmental activities in working toward the targets of the Environmental Action Plan for 2021 (covering fiscal 2019–21), formulated in line with the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan.
Our environmental strategy, centered on the Environmental Vision and our long-term environmental targets, is deliberated by the Executive Sustainability Committee, chaired by the president and CEO, and advanced by the Hitachi Group as a whole.

Environmental Management System Frameworks and Systems. 
Enhancing the Environmental Management System. 
Hitachi has built an environmental management system to promote activities aimed at attaining the goals of the Environmental Action Plan.
We have established globally applicable environmental classification criteria to conduct environmental management properly and efficiently in accordance with the environmental load and compliance risk levels of Group business sites, both large and small. We assign a score for each classification item, such as the amount of power consumed, the volume of waste generated, and whether or not legal restrictions apply. All Group business sites are then classified into A, B, or C, and environmental management is conducted according to the respective level of risk. Of our approximately 1,200 business sites, about 200 major manufacturing sites are classified as A, a category accounting for more than 90% of the Group’s total environmental load.
The business units and Group companies with category A manufacturing sites participate in. 
Eco-Management Meetings to draw up the Environmental Action Plan. The plan is then disseminated throughout the BUs and Group companies by environmental strategy officers, chosen from among the heads and general managers of those organizations.
The corresponding BUs and Group companies formulate their own environmental action plans based on the Hitachi Group plan. Our environmental management system is thus a product of a Group-wide effort, extending from the stage of formulation to implementation.
In addition to adhering to an in-house environmental management system, all our global category A manufacturing sites have acquired external certification, such as ISO14001. By seeking the opinions of external experts, we have developed a framework for Group-wide improvements in our environmental activities.

The collected data is aggregated and analyzed by the Sustainability Promotion Division, as well as by the administrative division of each business unit and Group company, and is used to identify environmental management issues, share instructive examples within the Group, and apply the PDCA cycle to improve environmental practices.
At the approximately 200 Hitachi manufacturing sites that have been prioritized for monitoring under our environmental classification criteria, we aggregate and analyze data on such key items as energy, waste materials, and water on a monthly basis, implementing measures to reduce the environmental burden and achieve the targets of our Environmental Action Plan.

GREEN 21 is used as a system for evaluating and managing our achievements made over three-year periods toward the targets set in our Environmental Action Plan.
GREEN 21 uses the environmental load data registered in our Environmental Data Collection. 
System (Eco-DS) to convert the success shown by each of approximately 200 major manufacturing sites at reaching the targets of the Environmental Action Plan into green points (GPs), then evaluates each site’s progress on a category-by-category basis. A perfect score for any category is 100. 
GPs. Meeting the Environmental Action Plan’s first-year targets is worth 40 GPs, meeting the second-year targets 60 GPs, and meeting the final-year targets 80 GPs. Points are also awarded for particularly ambitious and motivated activities, as an incentive, and progress made on the three-year Environmental Action Plan is comprehensively evaluated. Representing this progress as GPs shows how much each site has achieved in each category, and allows sites to be compared with each other, the results of which are in turn used in the Environmental Action. 
Plan’s PDCA (plan-do-check-act) cycles.
The Sustainability Promotion Division also uses the results of the GREEN 21 evaluation as a condition for awarding its Eco-Factories & Offices Select certification for business sites that promote activities demonstrating a high level of environmental consciousness and produce notable results in that area.
From fiscal 2019, progress will be evaluated and managed for individual categories newly created based on the Environmental Action Plan for 2021, and this will be used to promote further environmental activities.

In China, 73 people from 41 companies attended working-level courses in Beijing (September 2018) to not only deepen understanding of regulatory amendments but also to learn about the initiatives taken at Group business sites to save energy, recycle water, and reduce volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
In addition, they deepened their understanding of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at a seminar organized by an external consulting company.
The enforcement of China’s environmental laws and regulations has been growing more stringent under the guidance of the central government, and the number of charges and penalties has increased sharply. An environmental management training program—attended by 44 people from 36 companies—was held in Beijing, China, in March 2019 to reduce environmental risks and raise the knowledge of working-level employees. The program featured lively group discussions on various issues, including points worth noting in environmental compliance.
In addition to Hitachi Group training, individual companies and units provide education tailored to their own business area.
Environmental Compliance. 
In conducting business activities around the world, Hitachi seeks to minimize environmental risks to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations of each country and region.
One such effort is by setting and monitoring compliance with voluntary management criteria that are more stringent than regulatory requirements. In the unfortunate event that we do find a 37.

In addition to the internal audits set forth under ISO 14001, the major global business sites are audited by the Sustainability Promotion Division and the Internal Audit Office—which are corporate divisions of Hitachi, Ltd.—around every three years. Business units and Group companies have their own environmental audit programs. In the three years from fiscal 2016 to 2018, they conducted environmental audits at 70 of the 78 overseas business sites that have been prioritized for monitoring under our environmental classification criteria. The business sites identified as needing improvements were requested to submit action plans and provided with follow-up and advice until the plans were fully implemented. In these ways we comprehensively implement and enhance our environmental compliance framework.
In fiscal 2018, we received a worldwide total of 16 notices of regulatory violation concerning water quality, air quality, or waste matter and complaints about noise or odor. Of these, 3 were complaints from nearby residents regarding noise or odor, but they were all promptly addressed.
Hitachi will continue to implement enhanced environmental management in order to prevent repeated or new contamination occurrences.

Efforts to Achieve a Low-Carbon Society Policy. 
In line with the scenario in the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report to keep the increase in global temperatures below 2°C, we have established long-term reduction targets for CO2 emissions of 50% by fiscal 2030 and 80% by fiscal 2050 (compared to fiscal 2010 levels) throughout the value chain.
Approximately 90% of the value-chain emissions of our products and services—from the procurement of raw materials and parts to production, transportation, use, disposal, and recycling—result from the use of our products and services after they were sold. For this reason, to reduce emissions across the value chain and achieve our long-term targets, it is crucial that we reduce CO2 emissions not just during production but also during the stage of use.
Ratio of CO2 Emissions at Each Stage of Hitachi Value Chain. 
We will not only further enhance the energy efficiency of our products and services to contribute to emission reductions during their use but also seek to globally expand our decarbonization business that utilizes IT and other innovative technologies. We are also actively implementing measures to reduce CO2 emissions during production; in fiscal 2018, for example, we introduced the Hitachi Internal Carbon Pricing (HICP) framework to raise production efficiency at factories and offices and to promote energy-saving initiatives, and we are taking a variety of steps to accelerate the shift to renewable energy sources.

Improved Environmental Performance in Products and Services. 
Under the Environmental Action Plan for 2018, Hitachi set a target of reducing CO2 emissions during usage per product and service function. Our goal was to reduce CO2 emissions by 40% in fiscal 2018—the final year of the action plan—compared to fiscal 2010 for a group of products capable of making a big contribution to resolving environmental issues. Our actual rate of reduction in fiscal 2018 was 34%. We attribute the shortfall to the fact that, among our broad array of products, those featuring high environmental performance failed to reach their sales targets, resulting in a lower reduction rate for the Group as a whole.

Improving Environmental Performance Through Environmentally Conscious Design Assessments. 
We conduct independently developed Environmentally Conscious Design Assessments for all products and services involving a design process to steadily improve environmental performance throughout the Group. To reduce the environmental burden in multifaceted ways, 30 environment-related areas are assessed for their impact on climate change, resource depletion, and environmental pollution (ecosystem degradation) at each stage of our products’ and services’ life cycle.
In addition to implementing these assessments, to meet the IEC 62430*1 criteria for environmentally conscious design, we are integrating environmentally conscious design and development of products and services into our existing management system, including by meeting environmental regulatory requirements and ascertaining the environment-related needs of our stakeholders.
For our main, priority products, we conduct not only Environmentally Conscious Design. 
Assessments but also Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) to quantitatively evaluate their burden on the global environment in such areas as the consumption of mineral resources, fossil fuels, and water resources, as well as their impact on climate change and air pollution.

Participation in the Carbon Footprint Communication Program (Services & Platforms Business Unit, Hitachi, Ltd.)
The carbon footprint of products (CFP) is the CO2 equivalent of the total amount of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted over the entire life cycle of a product or service—from procurement of materials through to disposal and recycling. Making the GHG emission amount visible in this way encourages efforts to reduce the amount of carbon emitted by products over their whole life cycle. Countries and regions around the world use the CFP approach.
Hitachi launched CFP assessment in 2009. We participate in the Carbon Footprint. 
Communication Program of the Japan Environmental Management Association for Industry (JEMAI) and are working to expand the number of Approved CFP Products.*1 The program calls for the calculation and disclosure of CO2 emissions throughout the life cycle of approved products.

“Chatbot Service” to Facilitate Digital Communications (Systems & Services Business, Hitachi, Ltd.)
To support workstyle reforms, Hitachi, Ltd. developed and launched in June 2018 “Chatbot Service,” a digital communications tool that can advance operational reforms and create new value. The service uses a chatbot*1 to improve the efficiency of responses to inquiries for a variety of businesses. In responding to inquiries via chat, it automatically draws on operational scenarios and FAQs created from knowledge accumulated within a company.
This can lighten the work burden of help desks and contact centers that handle internal and external inquiries.
A chatbot service was developed following trials within Hitachi’s general affairs division, where it was used alongside human operators to respond to inquiries. This helped reduce the number of inquiries handled by operators in fiscal 2018 by 20% compared to fiscal 2017.
The improved efficiency in both workload and energy consumption from equipment use resulted in reducing CO2 emissions by 40% (equivalent to 1,280 kg-CO2) from the previous fiscal year, as calculated using the SI-LCA method*2 developed by Hitachi. This method assesses CO2 emissions over the entire life cycle of services and solutions, from design and development to use and disposal.
Hitachi will strengthen its chatbot functions and expand the range of digital communications services, developing them into solution cores for Lumada. We will thereby support the creation of new value and reform of workplace operations, while also contributing to reducing the environmental burden, such as through lower CO2 emissions.

UNIPARA-mini Series Uninterruptible Power System (Hitachi Industrial Products, Ltd.)
Hitachi Industrial Products provides an uninterruptible power system (UPS) to supply electricity in emergency situations, such as a power outage or malfunction, to manufacturing equipment, public facilities, and a range of other fields. In fiscal 2018, a new series of compact systems was launched called the UNIPARA-mini (10 to 50 kVA) providing high energy efficiency.
The UNIPARA-mini is the first small- to medium-capacity model in the industry to fully use a silicon carbide (SiC) element as the main circuit. The series takes advantage of the high-temperature operation features and high-speed switching capabilities of SiC elements to miniaturize the cooling unit and filter, reducing the weight by up to around 40% and the installation area by roughly 60%, compared to the previous model. In addition, thanks to the low level of electricity loss, the series offers an energy efficiency rating of 93.5% at 20 kVA (and maximum efficiency of 94.3%),*1 which is top-class for the industry, helping reduce. 
UPS power consumption. Through these improvements, annual energy reduction has increased to 8,744 kWh and CO2 reductions have risen to 4.6 t-CO2,*2 compared to Hitachi’s previous Hiverter-MP model.
*1 The efficiency rating is based on the 20 kVA UPS (20 kVA/16 kW output) and maximum efficiency on the 20kVA UPS (10 kVA/10 kW output), calculated using the UPS efficiency: measurement method of the JIS C 4411-3 2014 Annex J (standard). *2 Calculations for both the UNIPARA-mini and the previous model (H-MP) are based on an efficiency rating of 20 kVA, 24-hour continuous operations 365 days a year, an air-conditioning performance coefficient of 2.0, a power factor rating of 0.8, and a load factor of 100%.

Reducing CO2 Emissions at Factories and Offices. 
In order to achieve our long-term environmental targets, we are aiming to reduce CO2 emissions from our factories and offices 50% by fiscal 2030 compared to fiscal 2010 levels, and working to promote thoroughgoing energy savings and encourage the deployment of renewable energy.
Specifically, at our factories we are advancing initiatives to improve equipment efficiency by introducing and upgrading to high-efficiency equipment as well as to reduce energy use during production by raising efficiency through IoT-based measures such as installing smart meters.
At our offices, we are making efforts to reduce CO2 emissions by building new high-efficiency facilities and combining and integrating existing facilities.
We are also proceeding with plans to install solar power generation systems at our factories and offices and purchase renewable energy as well as advancing the adoption of renewable energy credits.*1 In fiscal 2018 we introduced a new solar power generation scheme. This is an off-balance-sheet self-consumption scheme in which solar power generation equipment is installed at facilities without becoming an asset of Hitachi itself, and under which electricity is paid for according to the amount generated. We are also advancing our purchasing of renewable energy, with wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal power already accounting for 100% of the electricity purchased at two business sites.
As a result of these initiatives, in fiscal 2018, 0.3% of the energy used across Hitachi was renewable energy generated at our factories and offices. We will continue to deploy renewable energy at our factories and offices, aiming to generate 2% of the total amount of electricity used by the Group by fiscal 2030.

Low-Carbon Roadmap for Factories and Offices. 
Introducing the Hitachi Internal Carbon Pricing Framework. 
We started operating the Hitachi Internal Carbon Pricing*1 (HICP) framework in fiscal 2018 in order to promote increased investment in low-carbon equipment at our factories and offices.
The HICP framework makes CO2 reduction due to investment in low-carbon equipment visible, and by adding the effects of such investment to previously calculated evaluations of the effects of energy reduction through investment, it helps to facilitate internal judgments on investment in equipment that take low-carbonization into account.
Specifically, with reference to emissions trading and carbon taxes inside and outside Japan, we establish company-internal carbon prices, convert into monetary value the effect of CO2 reduction due to investment in low-carbon equipment, add this to the value of energy reduction effects, and use the result to evaluate the effect of our investment. By applying incentives like these, we are expanding our investment in low-carbon equipment still further.
As the climate change issue deepens, we anticipate risks like increased burdens from carbon taxes and new emissions trading frameworks to emerge. By incorporating those risks into our equipment investment decisions, we can not only make low-carbon equipment investment a 50 0

Actions and Achievements. 
In fiscal 2018, the final fiscal year of the Environmental Action Plan for 2018, the reduction in energy use per unit, one of the environmental goals for factories and offices, was 14% against a target of 17% (from a base year of fiscal 2005). Part of the reason for not hitting the target was an increase in energy use due to the in-house manufacture of products that had been outsourced and a lower efficiency of facility use due to a decrease in sales. There were also some business divisions that could not achieve expected reductions in energy use per unit due to a failure to appropriately respond to a reduction in the fixed power allocation linked to sales. Because. 
Hitachi’s operations cover many different areas, reductions in energy use per unit at factories and offices are assessed using an activity amount*1 at each business site as the denominator.
The Environmental Action Plan for 2021 calls for even higher goals around the world, and we will continue to harness our expertise in control and IoT technologies to actively pursue energy conservation measures at our factories and offices.
We report the total amount of CO2 emissions from our entire Group, including CO2 emissions from power plants selling electricity. Total CO2 emissions in fiscal 2018 decreased by approximately 200 kt-CO2 compared to fiscal 2017. This is due largely to a reduction in the operation rate of power plants, as annual CO2 emissions by region, excluding that from these power plants, remained almost the same with that in fiscal 2017. In the Americas, a materials company that became a consolidated member of the Hitachi Group in fiscal 2016 accounts for a large portion of CO2 emissions, and we will look into ways to promote the use of inexpensive renewable energies.

Achieving Low-Carbon Factories Through Photovoltaic Power Generation (Tata Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. Pvt. Ltd.)
Tata Hitachi Construction Machinery in India, a consolidated subsidiary of Hitachi. 
Construction Machinery, is actively introducing renewable energy at its business sites.
India’s supply of electricity is chronically unstable, as rapid economic growth is causing demand for electricity to expand by an average of 4.9% a year. In response, the company is proactively introducing large-scale photovoltaic power generation facilities, which helps to not only stabilize the supply of electricity and operations at its plants but also reduce CO2 emissions and electricity costs.
A large-scale, 5,000 kW photovoltaic power generation facility was established on the grounds of the company’s Kharagpur Works in West Bengal State, generating around 7,000 MWh of electricity per year, or around 30% of the plant’s energy consumption.
This lowered CO2 emissions by around 3,500 tons in fiscal 2018 and also lowered electricity costs by some 25%.
The company’s Dharwad Works in Karnataka State, meanwhile, consumes around 7,500 MWh of solar energy generated offsite to meet approximately 75% of its annual electricity needs. The electricity is supplied through a power purchase agreement under.

Climate-related Information Disclosure (Based on TCFD Recommendations)
The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), established by the Financial. 
Stability Board (FSB), published its final report on information disclosure in June 2017 noting that investors needed more clarity in corporate disclosures on climate-related risks and opportunities and governance measures. In June 2018, Hitachi announced its endorsement of the TCFD’s recommendations.
The following contains key climate-related information in line with the TCFD’s recommendations.
Governance. 
Hitachi sees climate change and other environmental issues as important management issues.
In September 2016, after discussions at the Board of Directors, we established and announced long-term environmental targets called Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 containing CO2 reduction targets for 2030 and 2050.
In April 2017, we established the Executive Sustainability Committee, chaired by the president and CEO and staffed by other top executives, as the highest-ranking body to discuss and reach decisions on the Group’s sustainability strategy in accordance with our management and business strategies. Members meet twice a year to discuss material environment-related policies and measures, including those in response to climate change, to share progress reports and achievements, and to set the course for further improvements and new initiatives.
We have adopted a committee system to separate the responsibilities for management oversight from the execution of business operations. Under this system, the Audit Committee of independent directors conducts an audit of sustainability-related operations once a year. Reports on climate-related material issues are made to the committee by Hitachi executive officers.

Hitachi Sustainability Report 2019. 
Strategy. 
We established long-term environmental targets called Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 in September 2016 based on our Environmental Vision defining the goals of environmental management from a broader perspective. Wishing to fulfill our responsibilities as a global company in achieving a low-carbon society and taking note of the total CO2 reductions required globally— as projected under the RCP 2.6*1 and RCP 8.5*2 scenarios in the Fifth Assessment Report of the. 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)—we have set long-term CO2 reduction targets for our entire value chain of 50% by fiscal 2030 and 80% by fiscal 2050, compared to fiscal 2010.
Our 2021 Mid-term Management Plan announced in May 2019, meanwhile, calls for reducing. 
CO2 emissions throughout the value chain by more than 20% by fiscal 2021, compared to fiscal 2010.
*1 A Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenario under which, at the end of the 21st century, the increase in global temperatures from preindustrial levels is kept below 2°C. *2 An RCP scenario that assumes that emissions continue to rise, resulting in an approximately 4°C rise in global temperatures compared to preindustrial levels.

Identification and Assessment of Climate-related Risks and Opportunities. 
Climate-related Risks. 
As for climate-related business risks, we have followed the TCFD’s classification in considering (1) risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy in the 2°C scenario and (2) risks related to the physical impacts of climate change in the 4°C scenario, which assumes that efforts to reduce global CO2 emissions have failed. Risks are categorized into short term, medium term, and long term, defined as follows:
Short term: Over the next three years from fiscal 2019 to 2021 (corresponding to the three-year management period covered by the 2021 Environmental Action. 
Plan, in line with the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan)
Medium term: Through fiscal 2030 (time span of our fiscal 2030 long-term environmental targets)
Long term: Through fiscal 2050 (time span of our fiscal 2050 long-term environmental targets) (1) Risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy (applying mostly to the 2°C scenario)
Category Major risks Time span Main initiatives. 
Policy and legal Increased business costs from the introduction of carbon taxes, fuel/energy consumption taxes, emissions trading systems, and other measures. 
Short to long term Avoid or mitigate increases in business costs, such as from carbon taxes, by further enhancing production and transport efficiency and promoting the use of non- or low-carbon energy sources. 
Technology Loss of sales opportunities due to delays in technology development for products and services. 
Medium to long term Contribute to reducing CO2 emissions by developing and marketing innovative products and services that lead to the achievement of long-term environmental targets and expanding the decarbonization business. 
Promote the development of low-carbon products by implementing Environmentally Conscious Design Assessments when designing products and services. 
Market and Reputation Impact on sales due to changes in market values or assessment of our approach to climate issues. 
Medium to long term In the light of rising investor and market interest in climate change and growing expectations of the business sector, clearly identify the reduction of CO2 emissions in our management and business strategy by incorporating reduction targets for fiscal 2021 in the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan in line with our long-term environmental targets 51.

Category Major risks Time span Main initiatives. 
Acute and chronic Climate-related risks to business continuity, including increased severity of typhoons, floods, and droughts (acute risks) as well as rising sea level and chronic heat waves (chronic risks)
Short to long term Take into account the possibility of flood damage when deciding on the location or equipment layout of a new plant. Measures tailored to the water risks of each manufacturing site will be strengthened in the future based on the results of a water risk assessment now being conducted. 
Initiatives to Build a Water Efficient Society. 
Climate-related Opportunities. 
CO2 emissions during the use of our products and services by our customers account for approximately 90% of total emissions in our value chain. To achieve the CO2 reduction targets set forth in our long-term environmental targets and 2021 Medium-term Management Plan, it is therefore essential that we reduce emissions associated with the use of our sold products and services. Developing and providing products and services that emit zero or very little CO2 during their use can satisfy customer needs and help meet society’s demands for reduced emissions.
This represents a business opportunity for us in the short, medium, and long term and constitutes a major pillar of the Social Innovation Business that we are promoting as a management strategy.
We believe that our business opportunities will expand over the long term as we leverage the strengths of our operational technology (OT), IT, and products, as well as our expertise in R&D, to create such specific solutions as high-efficiency, energy-saving products; high-efficiency production systems using digital technology; power generation systems using non-fossil energy that do not emit CO2; environment-friendly mobility; and the building of smart, environmental cities.
Society’s need to adapt to climate change also presents business opportunities, as we can tap our technological capabilities to provide solutions in preventing and responding to natural disasters.
Climate-related opportunities. 
Category Major opportunities Main initiatives. 
Products/services and markets Increased market value and revenue from expanded sales of products and services with innovative technology that can contribute to the mitigation and adaptation of climate change. 
Expand the decarbonization business, develop and market products and services that contribute to a low-carbon society, and promote the development of innovative devices and materials that contribute to reducing the environmental burden. 
Resilience Provision of solutions to address climaterelated natural disasters. 
Provide disaster-mitigation solutions, such as high-performance fire-fighting command systems. 
Contributing to a Low-Carbon Society Through the Decarbonization Business. 
Responding to Business Risks and Opportunities of Climate Scenarios. 
To identify specific climate-related risks and opportunities, we examined the business impact of and responses to the 2°C and 4°C scenarios for five businesses that have a relatively high likelihood of being affected by climate change, namely, railway systems, automotive systems, water systems, power generation and power grids, and IT systems. These businesses contribute to improving people’s quality of life and enhancing value for our business customers and thus play an important role in our Social Innovation Business. Across all of these businesses, technologies that fuse our strengths in IT and OT, along with energy-related technologies, in particular, are deemed helpful in creating social and environmental value for our customers and society and in adding great value to climate change responses.
Upon examination of the five areas of the Social Innovation Business, we believe that by paying close attention to market trends and developing our business flexibly and strategically, we have high climate resilience in the medium to long term under either the 2°C or 4°C scenario.

Innovations in energy-saving technologies will further expand demand for energy-saving equipment and services. 
Climate change will lead to tighter CO2 emission regulations in each country and region and changes in the market environment, prompting shifts in customers’ business portfolios and IT investments. 
The development of and demand for energy-saving, high-efficiency IT and data analysis technologies will further expand. 
Demand will increase for high-efficiency IT systems utilizing CO2-free non-fossil energy. 
Investments and loans for low-carbon businesses, green bond issues, and other financial businesses will expand. 
The business environment under the 4°C scenario. 
Transport-related energy regulations will remain weak, discouraging a shift to railways, and conventional modes of transportation like automobiles and motorcycles will persist in some areas. 
The risk of flood damage to railways and related facilities will increase due to a rise in such natural disasters as typhoons and floods. 
Fuel efficiency laws and regulations will remain lax globally, and internal combustion engine vehicles will remain a major mode of transport; the modal shift will be slow, as conventional automobiles and motorcycles will remain predominant. 
The risk of damage to vehicles will increase due to a rise in such natural disasters as typhoons and floods in various areas. 
Demand for clean water will increase due to an increase in abnormal weather phenomena like floods, intense heat, and drought. 
Rising temperatures will cause a rise in the volume of required cooling water, the growth of bacteria and algae, and a deterioration in water quality due to floods. 
The risk of damage to water-related equipment from such natural disasters as typhoons and floods will increase. 
The cost competitiveness of non-fossil energy will increase and demand for renewable, nuclear, and other non-fossil energy will increase as the expansion of energy consumption pushes up the price of fossil fuels. 
The risk of damage to power plants and networks will increase due to such natural disasters as typhoons and floods. 
Demand for new, high-efficiency technology will expand as damage to information equipment from such natural disasters as typhoons and floods increases and as energy demand for multiplex IT systems in response to BCP increases. 
Investment in social and public systems to reduce damage from more frequent natural disasters will increase. 
Non-environmental factors (neither the 2°C nor 4°C scenario) and market conditions. 
Economic growth, urbanization, and population growth will drive the railway business globally as an efficient form of public transport for large numbers of passengers, regardless of whether CO2 regulations are tight; market size in Japan will remain flat, but other markets in Asia and elsewhere will expand. 
Major railway manufacturers will expand their business to meet global demand. 
Economic growth, urbanization, population growth, and infrastructure development like road construction will expand the global market for automobiles as a flexible and personal means of transport. 
Carmakers will have varying degrees of enthusiasm in promoting electrification. 
Non-environmental factors like safety, security, and comfort will drive competitiveness, as demand increases for new functions like autonomous driving and advanced safety features, and new mobility services like car sharing grow. 
Economic growth, urbanization, and population growth will push up demand for water in some areas. 
In Japan, local governments and other entities will accelerate wide-area collaboration and privatization in building water systems and improving the efficiency of their management. 
Replacement demand for aging water treatment facilities will increase in developed countries. 
Economic growth, urbanization, and population growth will push up demand for energy, especially electricity, mainly in developing countries. 
Energy source will be chosen from the perspective of not just CO2 emissions but also environmental burden, economic performance, safety, and supply stability. 
Stability and efficiency of the power supply will increase through the use of digital technology. 
Both companies and individuals will seek to diversify their energy supply and demand. 
Further digitization will exponentially increase the volume of data circulated, accumulated, and analyzed. 
New services and businesses utilizing big data, IoT, AI, and other digital technology will expand rapidly. 
Responses to future business risks and opportunities.

Total greenhouse gas emissions (Scope1, Scope2, and Scope3) across our consolidated value chain are calculated based on GHG Protocol standards and have been published since fiscal 2013. Total CO2 emissions can fluctuate greatly due to the restructuring of our operations, but given the nature of our business, some 90% of our emissions come from the use of sold products in Scope 3. Among our products and services featuring equivalent value, therefore, we give priority to providing customers and society with those that emit less CO2. At the same time, we will seek to further reduce CO2 emissions during production.

Risk Management. 
The Hitachi Group is engaged in many different businesses around the world, with each having its own set of risks and opportunities. Climate-related risks are evaluated and monitored for each business unit and Group company as part of a process of assessing risks and opportunities in accordance with the Environmental Action Plan, updated every three years. The results are tabulated by the Sustainability Promotion Division of Hitachi, Ltd., and their importance is checked at Sustainability Promotion Meetings. Those risks and opportunities perceived as being particularly important for the Group as a whole are deliberated by the Executive Sustainability. 
Committee, chaired by the president and CEO of Hitachi, Ltd.
Metrics and Targets. 
Our environmental activities are managed through the Environmental Action Plan, whose indicators and targets are updated every three years, including those to measure and manage climate-related risks and opportunities.
Under the 2021 Environmental Action Plan (covering fiscal 2019–2021), each business unit and Group company established their respective CO2 reduction targets in line with the 2021. 
Mid-term Management Plan, announced in May 2019, calling for a reduction of at least 20% in. 
CO2 emissions across our value chain by fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2010, and environmental activities are being advanced to achieve those targets. To enable the setting of targets and monitoring of progress across our many Group businesses and services throughout the value chain, we use the reduction rate of CO2 emissions compared to fiscal 2010 as an indicator.

Initiatives to Build a Water Efficient Society. 
As a resource, water is unevenly distributed across the world, and wide gaps between supply and demand are sometimes found even in the same region or country. In addressing water problems, therefore, region-specific risk measures must be developed that take the respective water stress*1 levels into account.
We examined water risks at each of our major manufacturing sites around the world, of which there are approximately 200, by using our Environmental Data Collection System (Eco-DS) and such globally recognized tools for water risk assessment as the Aqueduct, developed by the.

Efforts to Achieve a Resource Efficient Society Policy. 
According to the OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050 released by the Organization for Economic. 
Cooperation and Development (OECD), global water demand in 2050 is expected to increase by about 55% compared to 2010, and consumption among manufacturers, in particular, is projected to jump by 400%. In the light of these trends, expanding supplies of water for agricultural use will prove very difficult. As access to freshwater sources becomes increasingly limited, farming and urban areas will face serious threats should groundwater dry up.
The 2017 edition of the UN World Population Prospects predicts that the world’s population will increase from 7.6 billion in 2017 to 9.8 billion in 2050, resulting in a twofold rise in the consumption of material resources worldwide. The higher volumes of resources that are collected, extracted, used, and eventually emitted as waste are expected to have a severe impact on the economy, society, and the environment.
Hitachi’s business operations will respond to these issues by working with our customers and society to help build a society that uses water and other resources efficiently. We have set a fiscal 2050 target of improving the usage efficiency of water and other resources by 50% compared to fiscal 2010 levels. We will create higher economic value using less water and other resources and pursue production activities with a low environmental burden.

Nature (WWF) and the German development finance institution DEG; and the Flood Hazard Map of the World produced by the European Commission. We analyzed and evaluated water risks for each business unit and Group company, per country and region, and for the entire Group using approximately 50 risk assessment items, including physical risks like water stress, water pollution, and floods; regulatory risks leading to higher water and discharge costs or new taxes; and reputation risks that can negatively affect communication with stakeholders.
The results of the analysis and evaluation will be used to promote Group-wide activities to improve water use efficiency and to strengthen measures specific to the water risks of each manufacturing site.
Hitachi is also addressing water shortages at the society level through its global business operations by creating new sources of water supply. We provide customers in and outside Japan with a wide range of water-related products and services, such as wastewater recycling systems and seawater desalination systems. We also provide machinery, electrical equipment, and services for water infrastructure. To date, we have installed approximately 700 water purification plants and 900 sewage treatment plants in Japan, as well as over 200 plants in some 40 countries and regions around the world. In addition, we offer comprehensive digital solutions for water and sewage treatment operators by drawing on our experience and know-how of Operational. 
Technology (OT), IT, and products that have been cultivated over the course of many years as a comprehensive water service provider.
In fiscal 2019, we will conduct a study on applying big data to forecast water demand in collaboration with the city of Osaka. And we plan to start providing water suppliers with a system capable of instantly and accurately detecting leaks in water pipes in fiscal 2020.
Going forward, we will continue to help build a society that uses water efficiently by supporting the effective maintenance and management of social infrastructure, the optimum utilization of finite resources, and the provision of water environment solutions to enhance people’s quality of life.
*1 Water stress occurs when demand for water outpaces availability. The maximum volume of available water supply per capita is used as an index to measure levels of scarcity. The minimum volume of water required for living, agriculture, industry, energy, and the environment is considered to be 1,700 cubic meters per person per year, and regions below this level are said to experience water stress. According to the WRI Aqueduct risk analysis, when the ratio of total annual water withdrawn to average annual water supply within an area is 80% or more, it is defined as extremely high risk.

Reducing Water Use with a Closed-Loop Water Cooling System (Waupaca Foundry, Inc.)
Plant 1 of Waupaca Foundry (WFI) in the United States produces more than 3,000 types of castings, mainly automotive parts. At casting plants, water is required in large quantities to cool running machinery and cupola furnaces used in the melting process.
After introducing a closed-loop water cooling system, the amount of water intake in 2018 was reduced by approximately 454,000 cubic meters compared to 2015.
Prior to the initiative, cooling water flowed through industrial equipment only once before being discharged. The new closed-loop system reuses non-contact cooling water, leading to significant improvements in water use efficiency. The system is capable of reducing water intake by more than 80% and may, under certain conditions, virtually eliminate any water discharges.
WFI is aiming to reduce water intake by 72% compared to 2010 levels on a company-wide basis by fiscal 2021. It achieved a 52% reduction in 2018.

Reducing Water Use by Optimizing Ion-Exchange Water Treatment (Hitachi Chemical [Singapore] Pte. Ltd.)
Hitachi Chemical (Singapore) manufactures printed circuit boards for electronic devices and uses large volumes of deionized water to rinse the boards during the production process.
Such water is generated by first purifying industrial water through a process of reverse osmosis, separating purified water from concentrate, and then removing unwanted ions from the purified water through ion exchange. The concentrate is not utilized in the manufacture of printed circuit boards but can be used for other cleaning purposes and then discharged.
By optimizing the filters, sealants, and additional tanks used in reverse osmosis, water consumption has been reduced, with the ratio of purified water to concentrate rising from 60% to 85%, leading to greater efficiencies in the generation of deionized water. In fiscal 2018, the company was able to reduce water consumption by 8,045 cubic meters per month.

Improving Efficiency in the Use of Resources Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
Initiatives to Build a Society that Uses Resource Efficiently. 
To help build a recycling-oriented society, Hitachi is advancing measures at its business sites to improve resource use efficiency by 50% compared to fiscal 2010 by fiscal 2050. We are contributing to the solution of resource-related problems by promoting the utilization of recycled materials, manufacturing that is oriented to resource saving and long product life, reduction and recycling of factory waste, refurbishing*1 and remanufacturing,*2 and recycling of end-of-life products. These are advanced at each stage of the value chain, namely, procurement, development and design, production, distribution and sales, use, and disposal. Our Environmental Action Plan contains detailed three-year activity targets for improvements in the waste and valuables generation per unit and the achievement of zero waste to landfill. We have established indicators to measure our progress and are promoting activities throughout the Group to achieve these goals. In recent years, we have also been addressing the global problem of plastic waste, such as by finding efficient uses for the plastic waste generated in our business activities and by replacing one-way (disposable) plastic containers and packaging with paper. We will further strengthen our efforts to reduce our plastic waste.

Hitachi Sustainability Report 2019 and communication equipment in Japan received the METI Minister’s Prize at the 3Rs (Reduce,
Reuse, and Recycle) Promotion Merit Awards, sponsored by the 3Rs Promotion Council.
We are also promoting the refurbishing and remanufacturing of collected used products. In the. 
United States, when a customer replaces a large-capacity storage unit with a new model, parts of the end-of-use device are cleaned, inspected, and refurbished as warranty-backed Hitachi components, used in servicing older units. After collecting malfunctioning electric components from automobile dealers and repair shops, we disassemble, check, clean and restore, reassemble, and inspect those components, remanufacturing and marketing them as equipment featuring the same performance as new products. Used construction machinery like large hydraulic excavators and dump trucks are similarly remanufactured so they function like new and offered as high-function, reasonably priced products. We also collect end-of-use medical and industrial equipment (such as pumps, motors, distribution boards, transformers, refrigeration equipment, and air conditioners) and promote activities to reuse them as resources.
In an effort to use resources more efficiently, we also promote the use of recycled materials.
In fiscal 2018, recycled materials accounted for 2,415 kt (55%) of our total raw materials input of 4,403 kt. The share of recycled plastic used for the plastic parts of Hitachi appliances was 7%.
In addition to purchasing materials from manufacturers of recycled plastic, Hitachi Global Life. 
Solutions assigns a group company to process the plastic materials of end-of-life home appliances and plastic containers, reusing them as parts for washing machines and refrigerators and as packaging materials for ceiling lights. As a result of these efforts, it manufactured or used 926 tons of recycled materials in fiscal 2018.

Using IT to Manage Waste. 
Hitachi has developed and operates a waste management system aimed at efficient management and reduced compliance risk.
The generation and disposal of waste produced not only at our factories and offices but also during our contract operations are visualized and centrally managed. The information is added to our environmental performance data and linked to the Environmental Data Collection System (Eco-DS). In fiscal 2018, entries were made to the system regarding waste produced at approximately 1,500 business and construction work sites in Japan and at approximately 600 business sites in 41 countries. For waste generated at our 200 major business sites, information is sorted into three categories—hazardous, solid, and domestic—and data on disposal method, disposal contractors, recycling rates, and export status is collected and analyzed. This information is utilized to strengthen and promote measures aimed at reducing waste volume and improving.

Recycling of Amorphous Metal Materials (Hitachi Metals, Ltd., Hitachi Industrial Equipment Systems Co., Ltd.)
Hitachi Industrial Equipment Systems Nakajo Division manufactures amorphous transformers using amorphous metals to improve the electrical properties of the iron core, thereby greatly reducing energy loss.
Amorphous metals are high functional materials manufactured by Hitachi Metals. Unlike normal metals and alloys, they inhibit power conversion loss because of their random atomic structure, and the no-load loss of the core is approximately one-fifth of conventional materials, such as silicon steel plates. Transformers are used over long hours, for many years, and in large quantities, so the adoption of the amorphous core, which inhibits per-transformer electrical conversion loss, can significantly reduce energy consumption.
To promote the efficient use of resources, the amorphous metal scrap generated in the transformer manufacturing process at Hitachi Industrial Equipment Systems Nakajo. 
Division and the amorphous cores taken from end-of-life transformers are collected and recycled by Hitachi Metals Metglas Yasugi Works. In fiscal 2018, about 120 tons of amorphous metal waste were used to manufacture amorphous metal materials.

Reducing Landfill Waste and Increasing Recycling Through Sand Recycling (Waupaca Foundry, Inc.)
Waupaca Foundry (WFI) of the United States produces castings that are mainly used as automotive parts. Large volumes of spent green sand*1 is generated in the casting process. In order to reduce landfill waste disposal and increase recycling, the company installed a sand recycling system at Plant 5 in September 2016. In 2018, about 75% of some 26,000 tons of spent green sand generated was recaptured and reused. Moving forward, WFI plans to reuse 55,000 tons of sand annually.
The sand that can no longer be reused finds new life in applications in construction and agriculture and as fill material. WFI recycles some 460,000 tons of sand in such ways on a company-wide basis. Aiming to achieve zero landfill disposal, it has set a goal of reducing spent green sand by 30% in 2020 compared to 2010 levels. The company regards these initiatives as valuable opportunities to partner with the local community.

Efforts to Achieve a Harmonized Society with Nature Policy. 
To adequately preserve the ecosystem and achieve a harmonized society with nature so that we may continue to enjoy nature’s benefits, we have established targets to minimize our impact on natural capital as part of our long-term environmental targets. Specifically, we classify our activities into those that have either a negative or positive impact on natural capital with the aim of minimizing any negative impact by 2050.
We perceive our negative impact activities as including the emission of greenhouse gases and chemical substances into the atmosphere and the generation of waste materials. We make a positive impact, meanwhile, by providing products and services that contribute to ecosystem preservation and by undertaking social contribution activities to protect the environment through the preservation of biodiversity and ecosystems.
By classifying Hitachi’s activities across the value chain into those with positive and negative impact and then quantifying such impact, we are advancing initiatives to reduce our negative impact and maximize our positive impact.
A Timetable for Minimizing Impact. 
Initiatives to Minimize Impact on Natural Capital. 
Hitachi has identified and quantified the negative impact our business activities have on natural capital with the aim of reducing such impact. According to our estimates, approximately 40% of our negative impact in fiscal 2018 was related to climate change, and 20%, respectively, to waste materials, resource consumption, and urban air pollution. These results suggest that we need to further reduce our environmental load to minimize our impact on natural capital, such as by increasing the energy efficiency of our products and services, advancing factory efficiency, using resources more effectively, and properly managing chemical substances. Going forward, we will step up our environmental efforts to achieve our long-term environmental targets for a low-carbon society, a resource efficient society, and a harmonized society with nature.

Hitachi Sustainability Report 2019. 
As for our positive impact activities, we have been advancing social contribution activities like forest conservation and business activities that directly contribute to ecosystem preservation, such as building water treatment plants. We are also looking to quantify the impact of these activities.
We began such an effort in fiscal 2018 by estimating the benefits gained through forest conservation, which is a major positive impact activity for the Group. We focused on 24 business sites for which forest areas targeted for conservation activities could be ascertained. Using evaluation methods commonly used in forestry public works, we calculated the benefits in terms of flood prevention, water impoundment, water purification, soil loss prevention, and carbon fixation. We will share the results within the Group and continue to promote our activities going forward.

Managing Chemical Substances. 
The results of Hitachi’s identification of the negative impact on natural capital caused by its business activities in fiscal 2018 showed that around 20% of that impact was urban air pollution.
We believe that control and reduction of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), one of the causes of urban air pollution, and other chemical substances are important to minimizing our impact on natural capital.
In fiscal 2005, Hitachi formulated the Regulations for Environmental CSR-Compliant Monozukuri to manage chemical substances at all stages of its operations—from design and development, procurement, and production to quality assurance and shipping. Chemical substances in our products are divided into two categories, prohibited substances and controlled substances, for separate management to respond to legal and regulatory frameworks at shipping destinations.
With regard to chemical substances used in our business operations, we reduce risk by assigning three ranks to the use of such substances: prohibited, controlled, and reduced, as well as by educating chemical substance handlers and managers on laws and regulations and on proper risk assessment.
Managing Chemical Substances in Our Products. 
Hitachi designates the chemical substances in our products requiring management as Voluntarily. 
Controlled Chemical Substances. Within this category, we distinguish between prohibited substances (Level 1), which are basically illegal to use inside and outside Japan in products (including packaging) but which might be found in products from suppliers, and controlled substances (Level 2), which includes substances we are required to track and manage the use of and substances requiring attention to recycling or appropriate disposal methods. The list of managed substances and levels is regularly revised based on updates to Europe’s REACH*1 and other regulations.

Hitachi Group’s Voluntarily Controlled Chemical Substances. 
Working with the Supply Chain to Manage Chemical Substances. 
To ensure that we understand what chemical substances are used in our products—from design and development, procurement, and production to quality assurance and shipping—and to respond to legal and regulatory frameworks at shipping destinations, since fiscal 2005 we have worked with suppliers to gather and manage information on chemical substances in materials, components, and products via the Integrated Management System for Chemical Substances. 
Contained in Products. As of March 31, 2019, chemical substance information for more than 1.54 million parts and products was registered under this integrated management system.
The Integrated Management System for Chemical Substances Contained in Products was upgraded in April 2017 to incorporate the chemSHERPA format.*1 Accordingly, between July 2018 and March 2019, we held 13 briefings on chemSHERPA tools and our system for suppliers using the system at Healthcare Kashiwa, Omika Works, Mito Works, and Hitachi IE Systems. The briefings were attended by approximately 1,500 persons and helped to deepen understanding of these tools.
*1 chemSHERPA: A standard developed by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry to facilitate the management of chemical substances in products by creating a shared transmission scheme throughout the supply chain.
Integrated Management System for Chemical Substances Contained in Products. 
Managing Chemical Substances in Our Business Operations. 
Since fiscal 2016, we have been cutting emissions of chemical substances from our factories and other sites through stricter management, such as by expanding the number and scope of controlled chemical substances. Initiatives in fiscal 2018 to reduce emissions of chemical substances included switching from paints containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to water-soluble and powder paints as well as expanding their use and altering the painting and washing processes. These efforts enabled us to successfully achieve our reduction targets.
Information on our efforts has been translated into English and Chinese and shared globally with. 
Hitachi Group members. We also follow legally prescribed procedures in measuring and managing emissions of sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx),*1 whose measurement is required under the laws and regulations of our business site locations, and are advancing efforts to further restrict emissions.

Reducing VOC Usage and Emissions (Hitachi Rail SpA)
Hitachi Rail manufactures technologically advanced rolling stock, ranging from high speed trains to driverless metros. It works metal sub-components, welds car bodies, applies paints, assembles equipment and interiors, and conducts electrical and functional tests.
At the Pistoia and Reggio Calabria Plants in Italy, painting products were switched many years ago to a high-solid paint that emits fewer volatile organic compounds (VOCs), thereby minimizing VOC usage in the production process.
Over the past year, the solvents used for the pre-painting degreasing treatment of metal surfaces were substituted by a new ecological product that is completely VOC-free.
VOC usage was further significantly reduced through the adoption of a low-VOC cleaning solvent and solvent-reutilizing equipment for the cleaning of spray guns.
These new technologies have helped reduce total VOC usage in 2018 by about 16 tons compared to 2017, corresponding to a reduction of about 40 % in the total. 
VOCs used at the two plants.
Pre-painting degreasing treatment using a VOC-free solvent.
Reducing VOC Emissions (Hitachi Chemical Group)
The Hitachi Chemical Group produces a diverse array of functional materials and advanced components and systems. This requires the use of around 130,000 tons of chemical substances every year as raw materials for its products and as additives in the production processes. The chemicals used include around 60,000 tons of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are the cause of photochemical oxidants and suspended particulate matter.
Hitachi Chemical (Nantong) mainly produces functional resin and chemical raw materials.
Nearly 100% of the VOCs volatilized during the production process are detoxified by a combustion deodorizer and then discharged into the atmosphere. In fiscal 2018, its entire plant engaged in Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) activities to further reduce the emission of VOCs. A simplified VOC measurement device was used to identify leaks from valves and piping joints, and appropriate repairs were made, leading to the detection and sup- pression of minute VOC emissions that had been overlooked in the past. As a result, atmospheric emissions were reduced by 1.3 tons compared to the previous fiscal year.
Moving forward, efforts will actively be made by the Group as a whole to further limit emissions.

Preserving Ecosystems. 
Initiatives to Preserve Ecosystems. 
At Hitachi, we seek to reduce the burden (negative impact) on natural capital caused by business activities and to promote the positive impact, such as by undertaking social contribution activities to protect nature and providing products and services that help preserve the ecosystem, thereby minimizing our impact on natural capital by fiscal 2050 and realizing a harmonized society with nature.
In fiscal 2016 Hitachi created an Ecosystem Preservation Activities Menu citing the specific activities to be undertaken to promote the preservation of the ecosystem, including not only CO2 emission reductions, resource recycling, and chemical substances management but also activities that are difficult to quantify but are nonetheless important, such as the protection of rare species and efforts to make biodiversity a criterion when making investment decisions. We are encouraging each business site to advance their own initiatives. This menu was created by referencing the pioneering activities of other corporations and organizations and consists of 116 items covering all aspects of our business operations, including the value chain. Each business site selects those activities it will undertake from the menu, and the total number of initiatives becomes the. 
Group’s target for ecosystem preservation. Our goal for new initiatives in fiscal 2018 was 600, and 953 were actually launched.
Initiatives based on the Ecosystem Preservation Activities Menu have now become well-established, so no new Group-wide goals will be set for fiscal 2019 and beyond. Rather, ecosystem preservation activities will be advanced in accordance with the goals set by each business site.

Hitachi Building Systems supports the activities of the Arakawa Clean Aid Forum, a specified nonprofit organization that promotes cleanup activities along the Arakawa riverbed to restore its rich natural environment. The Arakawa River is one of the major water sources for the Kanto Region, which includes Tokyo.
The Arakawa Clean Aid Forum examines the kinds and volume of trash that are collected to ascertain the causes of litter and to identify amelioration measures with the aim of reducing damage to the ecosystem.
These cleanup activities, organized jointly by the Arakawa Clean Aid Forum and the. 
Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism, are held at more than 100 locations each year and attract a total of more than 10,000 participants.
Hitachi Building Systems initially participated with a handful of employees, but since 2015, when the riverbed cleanup became part of a new employee training program, more than 400 people have participated over several days each year. The cleanup is followed up with group work, including a meeting where the results of analysis and the opinions of participants are reported. Such meetings allow new employees to experience the full meaning and impact of CSR. In 2017 and 2018 Hitachi Building Systems employees accounted for some of the largest volume of trash collected and were honored with awards from the Arakawa Clean Aid Forum.
Much of the plastic waste in the ocean flows in from rivers. Hitachi Building Systems views the riverbed cleanup as contributing directly to resolving this increasingly serious global concern and will continue to support.

Globally, however, the situation around IP has been changing and the change is accelerating.
Attention has been drawn to liabilities and ethical issues arising from the application of AI, robots, autonomous driving, and other advanced technologies. The issuance of AI Ethics Guidelines in. 
Japan, the United States, and Europe is just one example of the growing demand for a response to these new technologies. There is also a growing trend toward data localization, as seen in the. 
European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). And, of course, handling IP has become one of the issues in the trade war between the United States and China. Under the circumstances, we must consider the geopolitical risks when we engage in IP activities. In addition, we are prompted to develop IP strategies based on a balance between competition and collaboration, responding to the rise of IT platform giants, increasing global M&As, and the advance of open innovation.
With all this in the background, we will accelerate our IP activities for a new era by accumulating findings and knowledge about new technologies and national and regional rules and regulations, aiming to create solutions that will deliver value to customers and resolve social issues in line with initiatives like the SDGs and Society 5.0. Regarding IP highly public in nature, for example, we will actively work on making it more publicly accessible, contributing to designing a future society in order to establish “IP for Society,” a new IP strategy for a new era.
Hitachi’s IP Activities for a New Era Policy. 
In the Social Innovation Business, Hitachi plans and implements IP strategies appropriate to each area of its product and digital solution businesses.
In the product business, where IP strategies are crucial for competitiveness, we are actively working toward obtaining and using patent and other intellectual property rights (IPRs), and enhancing our competitive edge by planning and implementing an “IP Master Plan” customized to the nature of our business.
In the digital solution business, on the other hand, we have promoted collaborative IP strategies.
As opportunities to co-create with our customers and partners using the Lumada IoT platform 82.

Hitachi Sustainability Report 2019 increase, we believe it is important to use IP to promote partnerships and to build ecosystems.
In order to leverage our IP activities and create solutions, we take a broader view of “intellectual property,” which goes beyond patents, copyrights, and trade secrets to include data and information assets as well.
Moving forward, we will make continued efforts to create solutions through IP activities.
Our Intellectual Property Division will participate in developing ways to promote new methods of collaborative creation, turning patent information into new technologies and cultivating data scientists capable of utilizing data for IP activities.
Additionally, in order to advance our open innovation activities designed to create solutions, such as the Ideathon and Hackathon, we have formulated the “Kyōsō-no-Mori” IP Guidelines, and will further evolve our IP Master Plan with the aim of combining our product and digital solution businesses.

Protecting Our Designs and Brand Policy. 
Protecting Hitachi’s designs and brand is crucial for promoting our Social Innovation Business and supporting our global operations. We operate a rigorous regime against such infringements as making and selling counterfeit goods copying our designs or carrying the Hitachi brand and illegally applying for or registering trademarks similar to the Hitachi brand.
Until recently, most counterfeit goods were manufactured in China, but over the past several years manufacturing methods and sales routes have become more sophisticated and diverse, which has spurred us to take further action.
Framework for IP Activities Frameworks and Systems. 
As of fiscal 2018, we had IP offices in New York and Santa Clara, California, in the United. 
States, Beijing and Shanghai in China, and London in the United Kingdom to cover our globalized business. As a “control tower” for reviewing and implementing new IP activities based on the focus sectors and regions for investment under the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, in fiscal 2019 we established the IP Strategy Department within the Intellectual Property Division.
Going forward, we will make efforts to seek cooperation with major sites around the world, forming global human capital networks in which the new department plays a central role, and building close ties with our newly established Corporate Venturing Office in addition to our strategy planning division and the government and external relations division in Hitachi, Ltd.
To develop globally minded IP human capital, since fiscal 1964 the Intellectual Property Division of Hitachi, Ltd. has operated an international job training system, sending trainees to IP law firms and Group companies in Europe and the United States to study abroad. In fiscal 2018, one employee went to the United Kingdom and one to Singapore for business training, while one employee was sent to Hong Kong in China to study.
Hitachi protects innovations generated from R&D activities under this framework. Specifically, we increased our patent application ratio outside Japan from 47% in fiscal 2009 to 58% in fiscal 2018. We will make further efforts to increase the number of solution patent applications in the. 
United States and China during the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, aiming to become one of the top patent holders in terms of quality and quantity in the field of social innovation. Going forward, we will continue to efficiently build and maintain our global patent portfolio.

Reward System for Employee Inventions Frameworks and Systems. 
We motivate employees in the R&D field with an ample reward system for new inventions.
To make this reward system as fair and transparent as possible, we set standards to evaluate inventions and disclose these standards to employees. We also have a mechanism for receiving inquiries about the rewards, as well as opinions on the reward system.
We have established a special division within the Intellectual Property Division to plan and operate this system, while an internal Invention Management Committee made up of R&D, legal affairs, personnel management, and IP experts ensures that the system operates effectively across the whole Group. The system includes an invention information channel to promote communication between inventors and the business divisions implementing the resulting patents.
Inventors can ask the business divisions for information about patent implementation and check the evaluation standards used to calculate the rewards for their inventions. To ensure transparency and inventor satisfaction, we also set up an Arbitration Committee for Invention Rewards, composed similarly to the Invention Management Committee. Inventors can appeal to this committee if they disagree with the amount they have been awarded.
From fiscal 2005, we have given President’s Awards to the top 100 inventors. Since fiscal 2006, we have also given awards to the top 50 young inventors (under 35 years old) based on patent application rewards received within five years of their joining Hitachi.
Achievements Through IP Activities Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
Our active promotion of IP activities, including efforts to formulate an IP Master Plan and plan. 
IP activities for collaborative creation with customers, have been highly acclaimed by external organizations. In recognition of these efforts, Clarivate Analytics included Hitachi in its Top 100.

Innovation presented Hitachi with the 2019 Imperial Invention Prize for our design of the Class 800 high-speed train for the UK. This is the third consecutive year that we have received high honors from the National Commendation for Invention, a prestigious Japanese award for invention established in 1919, and the first time that the Imperial Invention Prize, the highest prize offered by the National Commendation for Invention, has been awarded in recognition of outstanding design. Hitachi, Ltd. has been honored by the organization eight times in total, more than any other recipient. 84.

Human Capital. 
The source of sustained growth in the global and digital era is diverse talent to engender innovation and create new value. We at Hitachi seek to attract, develop, and organize our employees by building good relations with them, respecting their fundamental rights, providing equal opportunities, ensuring occupational health and safety, and optimizing the work-life balance. We also actively engage in dialogue regarding compensation and career development.
Hitachi’s Approach 2021 HR Strategy Policy. 
With a mission to contribute to business through talent and organization, Hitachi’s human resources division formulated its 2021 HR Strategy, based on the 2021 Mid-term Management. 
Plan that was announced in May 2018. The strategy sets out goals for our diverse employees around the world to grow through their work, to feel proud and happy about working at Hitachi, to respect diverse values, and to contribute to the creation of safe and vibrant workplaces each in their own way.
We are working to build a company where talent with diverse cultural backgrounds, experiences, and ideas can play an active role. We are cultivating a common Hitachi Group Identity in all employees worldwide so they may share the values of Harmony, Sincerity, and Pioneering Spirit that comprise the Hitachi Founding Spirit, working as One Hitachi across countries, regions, and divisions to contribute to society. We are visualizing talent and organizational data to achieve optimized placement, promoting communication and collaboration among employees, applying analytics featuring HR technology*1 to the accumulated data, and improving the efficiency of our operations.
Toward fiscal 2021, we will promote the following enhanced measures around the four key themes of “Talent,” “Culture,” “Organization,” and “HR Transformation.” *1 Technology that creates new value by applying big data analytics, AI, and other IT approaches to the domain of human resources.

Developing Global Human Capital. 
Hitachi’s Approach to Global Human Capital Management Policy. 
The source of innovation and corporate growth is human capital. In seeking to become a world leader in the Social Innovation Business, we at Hitachi implement a global, Group-wide strategy for the management of our diverse and highly engaged human capital, encouraging them to work across countries and regions and companies and maximize both personal and organizational performance. Further growing the Social Innovation Business on a global basis requires an optimized system for the hiring, promotion, and development of human capital. We thus have globally unified criteria for the evaluation of performance and offer a common leadership development program for employees around the world. In 2015 we announced a new theme for our efforts to build a corporate culture leading to enhanced global competitiveness that focuses on stirring the mindset and heightening awareness of each and every employee.
Developing Global Human Capital Frameworks and Systems. 
A major component of our strategy for managing global human capital is the Global Human. 
Capital Database of full-time, regular Hitachi Group employees. This database enables us to visualize our worldwide Group human capital and to understand the human resources data in macro terms. We have also built a grading system that applies to all managers and higher, using it as a common platform for job evaluations throughout the Group and as a common standard for assessing the value of management duties. In addition, we are implementing a global performance management system to align business objectives with individual goals and to promote the sustained improvement and growth of both individuals and businesses.
We are also working to develop the human capital to drive global business growth. We implemented “Hitachi University,” the global common platform for learning opportunities throughout the Group, where everyone is encouraged to learn for growth. In addition, with an eye to supporting the recruitment of full-time, regular employees as our operations expand globally, we have adopted a common recruitment support system worldwide to secure talented human capital, boost efficiency, and reduce hiring costs.
In addition, as a way of integrating the various existing measures for the management of global human capital, we have built a platform containing an array of information about the skills, career orientations, and other aspects of our human capital. The platform will enhance the visualization of our organization and human capital, leading to globally optimized placement, the identification and nurturing of management leaders of the future, and stronger manager- employee communication. This will help us build a human capital management system more aligned with the career and skills development orientation of individual employees.
Ensuring Fair Evaluation and Compensation Frameworks and Systems. 
With the globalization of business, there is an increasing need to establish a fair system of employee evaluation and compensation on a worldwide basis. Hitachi is building a management system based on consistent principles across all areas to attract diverse and highly engaged human capital regardless of nationality. In terms of compensation, for example, we have established a Global Compensation Philosophy shared by all Group companies based on the principles of ensuring market competitiveness, pay for performance, and maintaining transparency.
86. 
Human Capital. 
Contents Introduction Management Environmental Social Governance Data


Hitachi Sustainability Report 2019. 
We have developed a performance-based compensation system for full-time, regular employees that is fair and competitive in the context of the labor market for each national or region industry. Every year, the individual achievements of all employees are reviewed to set their compensation, and feedback on their evaluation results is provided to inspire them to develop and grow even further.
We ensure compliance with the laws and regulations of each country and region in which we operate when determining compensation. Starting pay for new graduates in Japan—who represent about half of all new employees hired each year across the Group’s global operations— is roughly 20% higher than the weighted average of Japan’s regional minimum wage.
Developing Human Capital for Frontline and Digital Operations Policy. 
In order to grow the Social Innovation Business, we reorganized our operations in April 2016 to enhance frontline functions and accelerate collaborative creation with customers. Frontline personnel are expected to work closely with customers and draw on Hitachi’s technology and know-how to develop new services and facilitate their implementation. We have thus bolstered our efforts to develop the human capital needed to lead the Social Innovation Business as frontline staff.
While many companies understand the need for a digital transformation involving digital technologies like AI and IoT and the utilization of big data, there is a global shortage of data scientists with specialist knowledge of data analysis. So in addition to offering digital solutions by combining our operational technology (OT) and IT—the core strength of our Social Innovation. 
Business—we have also launched an initiative to develop the human capital needed to drive such a digital transformation. We have set a goal of bolstering our Group-wide, worldwide force of data scientists to 3,000 by fiscal 2021 to strengthen our support for customers and to advance the global expansion of our digital solutions business.
Framework for Developing Human Capital for Frontline and Digital Operations Frameworks and Systems. 
Before reorganizing our frontline operations in 2016, we established a committee of officers and business unit managers in 2015 to identify the frontline functions, roles, and human capital to be strengthened going forward. Based on these discussions, in 2016 we created a four-phase. 
Social Innovation Business Front Talent Development Program covering everyone from top leaders to on-site staff. The program includes many forms of instruction, including action learning, group training, and e-learning. The first two phases for leaders of Hitachi’s collaborative creation business focus on action learning based on actual projects. Building on these results, the third and fourth phases offer training for all Hitachi Group employees worldwide.
Aiming to further develop and strengthen our frontline and other personnel engaged digital operations, in April 2019, we consolidated our various training institutes into the Hitachi Academy, a new company charged with developing the human capital to drive the digital transformation.
The academy will establish a new training system for digital operations and implement measures incorporating on-the-job training to accelerate the global growth of our Social Innovation Business.

Future Activities in Developing Human Capital for Frontline and Digital Operations Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
Since the fiscal 2016 launch of the Social Innovation Business Front Talent Development Program, some 1,300 employees have undergone group training in the three years up to fiscal 2018.
An additional 42,000 employees have taken e-learning courses that summarize the basic concepts of the Social Innovation Business. The content of the training provided in phases III and. 
IV will henceforth be used to give all human capital in digital operations a common, basic grounding in the Social Innovation Business. Some e-learning courses will be translated into English and. 
Chinese and broadly made available at Group companies worldwide.
Globalizing Management Training Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
Along with the rollout of global human capital management, we are also globalizing our programs to develop management-level human capital.
We began to thoroughly revise our training of management candidates in fiscal 2015, implementing the Global Leadership Acceleration Program for Key Positions (GAP-K) to accelerate their development. GAP-K helps participants to look at themselves objectively through three modules and to gain a deeper understanding of the Hitachi Group Identity and their own role in maintaining it. They commit themselves to vigorously and fully resolving business issues and challenges with a sense of mission and purpose, share values and goal-oriented thinking while inspiring others, and declare, in their own words, how they will put their skills into practice.
Participants also discuss strategies for global business expansion, with special reference to emerging markets, and explore how these strategies can be applied to Hitachi’s existing businesses and further growth. In fiscal 2018, 31 people were selected to participate in GAP-K over a three-month period in Japan and India.
Additionally, Hitachi has held the Global Advanced Program for Leadership Development (GAP-L) in Singapore every year since fiscal 2012. The program mainly targets local human capital with potential for leadership at the respective overseas subsidiaries. It is aimed at fostering a deeper understanding of the Hitachi Group’s global growth and developing the leadership, thinking, and skills needed for such growth. In fiscal 2018, GAP-L was expanded into a biannual program, and 52 leaders from around the world took part.
We also held the Global Leadership Acceleration Program for Managers (GAP-M) and the Ready to Lead (R2L), the standard leadership training courses for general managers and new managers that started in fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2018, around 3,100 people worldwide took part in these courses across our Group. As a result, the total number of participants has exceeded 17,000.
In fiscal 2019, we plan to launch the Global Group Executive Development Course (Global. 
GEC) for new leaders of Hitachi subsidiaries outside Japan. This e-learning course fosters a basic understanding of Hitachi’s management and provides the latest information on relevant topics.
We will continue to cultivate global leaders to guide Hitachi’s business by strengthening and expanding training programs for management personnel.

Providing Younger Employees with Overseas Experience Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
Hitachi maintains a broad array of programs to systematically cultivate and secure people who can succeed in global business. To develop the careers of people capable of understanding and adapting to local cultures and lifestyles, we offer a program enabling younger employees to live outside Japan. We have dispatched around 5,000 Group employees over eight years beginning in fiscal 2011, allowing them to take part in more than 80 programs designed to promote understanding of other cultures and to engage in language studies, local field studies, and internships, as well as to provide opportunities to work with local people to resolve social issues.
In fiscal 2015, we shifted our focus to a practical, work-related model of overseas postings instead of the former emphasis on language learning and cross-cultural activities. And in fiscal 2019, we moved to encouraging employees to engage in opportunities for leadership training to accelerate the development of employees ready to take on global challenges.
Skills Development of Chinese Employees Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
The Hitachi Group in China is working to improve the expertise and overall skills of local employees through the Hitachi University curriculum, on-the-job training, and e-learning. The content and timing of the training program is determined scientifically in accordance with employee workplace and job classification. In addition to these programs, in fiscal 2018, the Hitachi Group conducted 60 group training sessions in China to improve and develop the skills of its employees; over 1,000 people participated in these sessions.
Hitachi’s Approach to Career Development Support Policy. 
There are differences among individual employees with regard to what they find fulfilling in their lives and careers. Bearing this in mind, Hitachi has developed a broad range of career development support that focuses on employees’ “internal careers,” namely, their individual values and views on the significance and meaning of their work. In addition to ensuring that these individuals can fulfill their potential and maximize their creativity, our aim is also to link that individual growth to the positive outcomes and growth of the organization, thereby enhancing our corporate value.
Along with promoting self-understanding and fostering strong individuals with the independence and autonomy to think and act for themselves, we are also providing support to create a framework that will capitalize on the engagement and motivation of individual employees and to enhance mutual understanding as a way of fostering the teamwork needed to enhance organizational strength and performance.
In pursuit of becoming a major global player, we are upgrading individual and organizational performance as one of our top priorities. We respect employees’ individuality and personal aspirations in promoting career development and implement Hitachi’s Global Performance. 
Management (GPM) grounded in diversity and the individual. We are also committed to supporting career development by fostering communication and mutual understanding between employees and their organizations based on programs encouraging individual employees to take greater control of developing their own careers. In these ways, we provide the resources and tools that enable a wide range of people to work together with enthusiasm.
Career Development Management Frameworks and Systems. 
For Hitachi, the center of career development is the work that employees perform daily in the workplace. Based on GPM, we implement a cycle aimed at the growth of each employee through a process in which goals for daily tasks are set and then pursued, followed by the evaluation of the results to formulate the next objectives. Every fiscal year we also conduct “performance planning,” in which individual employees work with supervisor guidance and support, consulting with their supervisors to reach a consensus regarding short-term objectives. These consultations include discussions about past work and evaluations of the content of the work performed to 89.

Hitachi Sustainability Report 2019 date and the degree to which employee goals were met, followed by the setting of goals for the next fiscal year. Repeating the GPM cycle improves individual performance and further increases motivation and creativity, spurring individual growth and improving organizational results. Along with GPM, employees also take part in career consultations with their superiors to discuss their medium- and long-term career plans regarding such matters as requests for transfers or overseas postings.
In addition, Hitachi administers the Career Counseling Center as part of career development support, in order to provide employees with professional counseling services to help them proactively address concerns related to such issues as their jobs, career plans, or personal relations.
Conducting Career Development Workshops Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
Along with our workplace career development, we also provide direct support for individual career development through our career development programs. Our key program is the Hitachi. 
Career Development Workshop (H-CDW), launched in fiscal 2002 as a Group-wide initiative in. 
Japan. Around 12,600 people have participated in the program so far (as of March 31, 2019), with a focus on technicians, managers, and researchers in their 30s. Participants use self-analysis to deepen their self-understanding with an emphasis on their “internal careers,” affirming their career direction, goals, and paths so that they can direct the development of their own career and skills. H-CDW has gained recognition as a high-quality program for in-house career development that has built up research and improvements during a period of over 40 years.
According to the survey conducted of the participants for fiscal 2018, about 90% of the answers agreed that “H-CDW has been helpful to my career development and work.” Specific responses received include “Reflecting on my inner career reaffirmed my view of career development (working life) and the meaning of the work I do,” “I learned more about myself and began to seriously think about where I want to be 5 or 10 years from now,” “I gained a renewed awareness of the importance of my position and responsibilities,” and “I was able to make concrete plans for my future steps.”
In addition to those programs, Hitachi also offers programs targeting specific age groups, such as career education for younger employees and training for middle-aged or older employees to help them prepare for the changes ahead in their careers. Regarding training for employees aged 50 and over, a survey conducted between October 2017 and March 2019 found that 90% of participants felt that the training had been beneficial. One respondent noted, “I was able to grasp my current situation and look at myself with fresh eyes,” while others said, “It was a good opportunity to rethink my attitude toward work and financial planning” and “I would like to make the most of and nurture my career and strengths.” “Make a Difference!” Project Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
Hitachi believes that raising awareness of each and every employee holds the key to achieving the corporate reforms needed today to remain strong 10 years from now. We thus launched a three-year “Make a Difference!” project in fiscal 2015 involving all Group employee to cultivate an “I will” mindset in line with the 2018 Mid-term Management Plan. In fiscal 2015, the first year of the project, we organized a contest for new business and internal-reform ideas with the aim of encouraging employees to think and act independently. More than 600 entries were submitted from around the world. In fiscal 2016, the second year, the contest evolved into one of proposing business plans, as many expressed a desire to actually implement their ideas. We believe this helps employees gain new insights as they put their ideas into action, and the experience can be an opportunity to think on one’s own, make decisions, and see a project through to completion.
Even those applications that did not pass the screening stage were given feedback on how they could be improved to encourage further growth in the applicant.
We received numerous applications from within and outside Japan during the three-year project, including proposals from teams spanning business units and divisions. Some award-winning projects have actually been adopted as in-house pilot programs. Examples include Mobile Subscriber Analytics, a cellphone analytics program that can help carriers acquire or retain customers; and MyLifePal, a healthcare app that not only manages sleep and diet data but can also measure pulse and stress level by analyzing facial images.

Conducting a Global Employee Survey Frameworks and Systems. 
Since fiscal 2013, we have been conducting the annual global employee survey, Hitachi Insights, as a way of measuring employee engagement.*1 In September 2018, the survey was administered for the sixth time. Around 210,000 employees worldwide were sent the survey in one of 14 different languages, and roughly 180,000 responses were received.
According to the aggregate results, the overall rating has improved for the fifth consecutive year. Scores were particularly high for “pride in your company,” “delegation of authority,” and “management of supervisors,” suggesting that employees are proud to be part of a company that is aiming to digitally transform the social and business infrastructure and advance the Social. 
Innovation Business to become a global leader. On the other hand, scores for “resources and support” remained low from fiscal 2017, although there was a slight improvement. We will continue to address this issue through work-life reforms, introduction of new tools, and deepening of communication with employees.
Survey results are sent directly to immediate section and department heads so that they can confirm the survey results and communicate with team members. This can lead to concrete initiatives through the PDCA cycle, further enhancing the level of engagement within Hitachi as a whole.
*1 Hitachi uses the term “engagement” to refer to employees’ understanding of the company’s strategies and policies, as well as their job satisfaction and desire to take actions on their own initiative to bring about results.
Diversity and Inclusion. 
Statement on Diversity and Inclusion Policy. 
Diversity and Inclusion Open Our Future. 
Diversity is the wellspring of our innovation and our growth engine. Hitachi regards personal differences such as—gender, nationality, race, religion, background, age, and sexual orientation— as well as other differences, as facets of people’s individuality. By respecting our employees’ individualities and positioning them as an advantage, Hitachi frames its diversity and inclusion as conducive to both the individual’s and the company’s sustainable growth. With a diverse workforce, strong teamwork and broad experience in the global market, we will meet our customers’ needs.

The Diversity Development Project, launched in fiscal 2006 under the president’s direct control, was replaced in fiscal 2009 with the Diversity & Inclusion Development Center, which currently operates under the direct supervision of the Human Capital Group of Hitachi, Ltd.
Hitachi, Ltd. and 15 Group companies jointly operate the Advisory Committee and the. 
Diversity Development Council to accelerate awareness across Hitachi as a whole, including support for diverse human resources and work-life management. The Advisory Committee ensures follow-through on our diversity management policy, while the Diversity Development. 
Council discusses specific activities and shares best practices. Both meet every six months.
Group companies and business groups/sites have also set up their own diversity-promotion organizations and projects, such as those to help develop women’s careers, in order to enhance initiatives geared to the challenges faced by individual workplaces.
Alongside diversity management promotion within each Group company according to its individual challenges and circumstances, we are also accelerating Group-wide global initiatives such as the Global Women’s Summit.
We also hold regular meetings to exchange opinions on diversity with labor unions.
Accelerate promotion throughout Group, including outside Japan 92.

Toshiaki Higashihara and outside director Cynthia Carroll. There was also a lively exchange of opinions at a panel discussion among female leaders from the Hitachi Group, and three different workshops on unconscious bias, career development, and leadership. A subsequent networking reception gave the participants an opportunity to share stories about their careers and the challenges at their workplace and deepen mutual relationships. At this Global Women’s Summit, not only did the participants realize a range of challenges, but they also gained a better understanding of the.

Recruiting Local Human Capital for Senior Management Positions Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
The railway business is an important business field for which growth is expected in overseas markets, particularly Europe and Asia. To further solidify our position in this industry, we shifted the primary site of our railway business to London in 2014 and built a global operations framework managed by Hitachi, Ltd. and several other Group companies, with 40% of senior management positions held by European personnel. The CEO of global operations is a London local who previously served as president of a Group company in the United Kingdom and has since become an executive officer at Hitachi, Ltd. as well. Our railway business is a crucial one, driving. 
Hitachi’s growth, and we have grown it steadily through M&A and other strategic activities.
Global Recruiting and Globalizing Human Capital Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
As a means of developing markets worldwide, we have been accelerating the globalization of human capital in Japan through three initiatives: (1) recruiting “global business personnel” who can promote global operations, (2) providing younger Japanese employees with experience outside Japan, and (3) providing globally unified management training.
Given the globalization of our business, our hiring activities are designed to secure the right personnel. In principle, we categorize all employees graduating from universities and technical colleges as global business personnel who can contribute to driving our global operations. Our priority in employing such personnel is to attract those who are eager to build their foreign language skills and relish the challenge of working in different cultures, social settings, and work environments.
Expanding Hiring of People with Disabilities Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
Hitachi, Ltd. and Group companies in Japan have worked hard to employ people with disabilities, such as by holding a special hiring fair and study meetings for Group companies to share information. We have also worked to expand the range of employment opportunities for people with disabilities, coordinating with special subsidiaries to develop new positions for such individuals in IT—specifically, robot process automation (RPA). As a result, as of June 2019 the employment ratio of people with disabilities was 2.26% at Hitachi, Ltd.*1 and 2.33% for the entire Group in. 
Japan. Both of these figures exceed Japan’s legally required employment rate of 2.2%. We will maintain our Group-wide drive to hire more people with disabilities.

Hitachi’s Work-Life Management Approach Policy. 
The aim of Diversity & Inclusion is to maximize our employees’ performance, and to enhance our organizational capabilities as well as to create new synergies, thereby improving productivity and expanding our business. It is necessary to have a comfortable working environment that embraces flexible and diverse workstyles, allowing our diverse workforce to perform at their best.
Hitachi has built on its work-life balance initiative, which promoted a balanced lifestyle, and now promotes work-life management, which encourages employees to proactively take charge of improving the quality of both their work and private lives. We believe that practicing work-life management will enrich employees’ work and private lives, enhance professionalism and build personal character, resulting in both individual and organizational growth over the long term.
Hitachi’s Work-Life Reform Approach Policy. 
In December 2016, Hitachi, Ltd. launched a companywide work-life reform initiative, “Hitachi. 
Work Life Innovation,” to promote workstyles allowing talent from diverse backgrounds to work with enthusiasm and demonstrate strong performance.
Hitachi seeks to expand its Social Innovation Business, which aims to resolve its customers’ and society’s increasingly diverse and complex challenges, and to improve people’s quality of life on a global scale. In order to realize this, we need to have talented, active human capital with diverse values.

Hitachi Sustainability Report 2019. 
With the decline in the working-age population due to low birthrates and aging, as well as workers’ diversifying needs, work-life reform is a pressing issue across all of Japan. We too are striving to realize our vision of Hitachi’s future by promoting work-life reform.
Framework for Work-Life Reform Frameworks and Systems. 
Under the Hitachi Work Life Innovation initiative, labor and management at Hitachi, Ltd. work together to realize work-life reform. In the 2018 spring labor-management negotiations, it was decided to promote time- and location-independent working practices, and we are moving forward creating systems and working environments in which employees can continue producing results while maintaining work-life balance.
In order to put work-life reform into practice, it was determined that reform of administrative operations at the company’s headquarters was necessary. Based on requests from business units and departments and other considerations, Hitachi created three subcommittees to review both its headquarters’ business operations and processes that affect the whole company: the. 
Budget Innovation Subcommittee, the Internal Audit Innovation Subcommittee, and the Meeting/
Reporting Innovation Subcommittee.
In 1999, Hitachi implemented telecommuting and satellite office work programs. Today, 70% of all full-time, regular employees are covered, including managerial-level employees, flex workers, and career-track employees who need to balance work with child care or nursing care.
The programs do not require the applicants to come into the office for a certain amount of time, nor are there any limitations on the number of times for doing so, allowing employees to work from wherever they need to be for child care, nursing care; or, if posted away from their families, they can work from their family home. We are also rolling out location-free work for managerial-level employees, allowing them to perform their duties from anywhere when approved by the company.
Security environments equivalent to the company’s are being prepared at multiple business sites in the Tokyo metropolitan area as we expand our satellite office facilities for the use of business units, departments, and Group companies.
Work-Life Reform Initiatives Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
Hitachi, Ltd. is currently addressing work-life reform in three areas: improving work processes, augmenting management, and promoting time- and location-independent work practices.
Regarding improving work processes, the Meeting/Reporting Innovation Subcommittee has reduced meeting time by about 60% by cutting down on the number and duration of regular meetings attended by business units and general meetings. It has also begun using a support tool designed to improve meeting efficiency and optimize meeting durations and numbers of participants.
On augmenting management, the company is increasing operational transparency using in-house consultants and an experience-oriented approach to discover issues. Countermeasures are taken and results are being produced. In fiscal 2017, the experience-oriented approach was applied to about 80 teams prone to excessive working hours, resulting not only in fewer overtime hours but also improvements in such areas as collaboration among team members and work instructions from team leaders to staff. In fiscal 2018, the initiative was scaled up to about 260 teams. The company is also improving its attendance management system for compliance enforcement.
As for promoting time- and location-independent work practices, the company is promoting use of its telecommuting program and has distributed around 30,000 IT tools such as headsets, mic speakers, and LCD monitors to create environments where the in-house wireless local area network (LAN) can be accessed safely, as well as holding paperless and online meetings. Since 2016, we have been expanding the number of our satellite offices, and as of March 31, 2019, we have 49 business sites used by more than 50,000 people from across the Group each month.
Additionally, in July 2018, some 2,750 employees participated in Telework Days 2018, a national event sponsored by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications to promote work-life reform.

Enhancing Work-Life Management Support Systems Frameworks and Systems. 
Since the 1990s, Hitachi, Ltd. has been introducing and expanding an array of programs to support work-life balance, striving to create a more friendly working environment.
Following the introduction of our Allowance for Balancing Child Care and Work in fiscal 2016, in fiscal 2018, we launched “Hokatsu Concierge,” the information-providing service supporting the search for a nursery. With the rise in nursery schools’ waiting lists being a social issue, by providing this kind of support, the aim is to smooth the path for employees return from maternity and parental leave and create an environment where work and parenting can be balanced with peace of mind.
Additionally, with Japan’s society continuing to age, it is expected that more employees will be involved in caring for their elderly family members. We have, therefore, declared the years from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2020 a period to focus on reinforcement of work and nursing care balance support, and are expanding programs. In fiscal 2018, we established a new “Points for Balancing. 
Nursing Care and Work” system strengthening financial support for employees balancing work with nursing care. We also conducted awareness surveys and work-life balance seminars to encourage employees to prepare for this issue, emphasizing the importance of balancing work with nursing care and conveying practical know-how on the topic.

Policies. 
In accordance with our mission, “Contribute to society through the development of superior, original technology and products,” the Hitachi Group will endeavor to ensure safe and healthy workplaces under the principle of “Health and Safety Always Comes First.”
To accomplish this, we will: 1. Continually be involved in health and safety activities in order to prevent work-related injuries and sickness by designating the health and safety of employees as management’s top priority.
2. Comply with the local laws and regulations in each company regarding health and safety.
3. Develop a safe and comfortable work environment by encouraging employees to maintain their own health and taking a proactive stance on health and safety activities in the workplace.
4. Require an understanding of Hitachi’s principle and the promotion of health and safety awareness from all business partners of the Hitachi Group.
5. Contribute to the creation of a safe and pleasant society by emphasizing activities that make health and safety a top priority in all of Hitachi’s business activities.

Safety Management Framework. 
Initiatives for Preventing Work-related Accidents Frameworks and Systems Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
Hitachi views occupational health and safety as vital employment conditions for advancing its business. Based on the policy above, to prevent work-related accidents among our roughly 300,000 Group employees worldwide, we set and apply our own safety standards to be observed at manufacturing sites around the globe, where the risks of work-related accidents are high, as well as advancing health and safety measures tailored to the operations of individual companies. In particular, since the establishment in April 2019 of the Safety Management Division, we have worked to improve our safety measures in terms of both policy, by examining and improving our risk assessment frameworks, and technology, by using IT and digital technology to prevent accidents.
We had already introduced the Hitachi Group Key Safety Management Designation System, which promotes the improvement of safety measures and reinforcement of safety activities at. 
Hitachi Group companies and business sites that have experienced serious work-related accidents.
Under the leadership of top executives, these companies and business sites take on both management-driven and bottom-up initiatives to formulate specific plans, and the progress of these plans is monitored by safety officers, who also lead initiatives to prevent recurrence.
Additionally, because the risk of accident is higher for workers not yet accustomed to their work or environment, employees and temporary workers receive individual health and safety training and on-the-job training before work begins, to help prevent accidents by ensuring that they understand work procedures and dangers. At the same time, on occasions of business restructuring, we share the details of the health and safety management frameworks and initiatives of the organizations to be merged in advance, and, paying all due respect for the safety cultures on both sides, ensure that safety is always preserved during the execution of a smooth business launch.
Sharing and Using Information to Prevent Accidents Frameworks and Systems. 
Since 2012, the Hitachi Group Health and Safety Portal System has allowed every Hitachi. 
Group company in Japan to track the occupational health and safety performance of the entire. 
Hitachi Group.
When a work-related accident occurs in Japan, depending on its level, the results of analysis on its causes and examples of countermeasures are registered in the system and shared with the entire Group as part of the knowledge base. Know-how gained in this way is used globally.
By analyzing from many angles the detailed information about accidents gathered in the system, similar accidents can be prevented. In 2014, we also began surveying the number of accidents outside Japan in order to grasp the global situation regarding accidents. We intend to expand the use of the Hitachi Group Health and Safety Portal System globally in future.
Since 2018, in order to promote the management-driven reinforcement of Group-wide occupational health and safety activities, the state of occupational health and safety management has been reported regularly to the Senior Executive Committee and meetings of business unit and Group company presidents.
Additionally, the Safety Strategy Congress for safety officers from each Group company and representatives from each division has so far seen around 350 attendees in all. Activity promoters.

Actions and Achievements Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
In Japan, a health and safety commission—composed of business owners, labor union officials, and employees—is convened at each business site every month to discuss and share information related to such issues as work-related accident cause analysis and countermeasures and health and safety activities in light of the situation regarding employees who have taken sick leave.
This initiative allowed us to achieve zero fatal work-related accidents worldwide in 2018, but we have not yet eliminated accidents altogether. Taking an honest view of our present situation, we are continuously striving to improve our safety management system, making use of external consultants to bring in objective, third-party perspectives, improving our ability to determine the cause of accidents, and reviewing our risk assessments.

Approach to Improving Employee Health Policy. 
Hitachi believes that health is the foundation for employees being able to work with energy and peace of mind. The basic principle of the Hitachi Group Health and Safety Policy, shared by all. 
Group companies globally, is that “Health and Safety Always Comes First.” Based on this principle, we strive as one to create working environments that allow workers to do their jobs without anxiety over their mental or physical health. In particular, within Japan, we are promoting support for identifying employees struggling with physical and mental issues, not just work-related but also private, and work with the Health Insurance Society to promote the individual support provided to each employee.

Framework for Promoting Health and Productivity Management Frameworks and Systems. 
In Japan, occupational healthcare workers, human resources divisions, and the Health Insurance. 
Society work together to promote a range of health support and appropriate health management in accordance with Japan’s Industrial Safety and Health Act.
In Ibaraki, Tokyo, and Kanagawa Prefectures, where many Hitachi Group business sites are concentrated, a system of health-management centers has been put in place, staffed with occupational doctors, nurses, and other occupational healthcare personnel. The center promotes occupational healthcare activities unified at the regional level. In other location, occupational doctors and nurses work in cooperation with human resources divisions to maintain and improve the health of employees.
Additionally, Hitachi Group occupational healthcare workers and human resources officers provide opportunities for the qualitative improvement of occupational healthcare activities and the human capital development of occupational healthcare workers at all sites by regularly holding meetings, study groups, and training sessions to hold debates and report research results on the theme of maintaining and improving the health of employees.
Raising Health Awareness in Conjunction with Work-Life Reform Frameworks and Systems. 
Hitachi is conscious of the importance of employee health and the health of their families as the foundation of employee self-development in both their private and working life. This thinking has been refined within the concept of our “Hitachi Work Life Innovation” activities so that both the company and its employees can work to implement work-life management and improve their productivity with shared awareness of the importance of health.
Initiatives Toward Improving Employee Health Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
At each Hitachi Group company in Japan, the health maintenance of employees is supported through the provision of health maintenance measures based on periodic medical exams and other examinations to prevent serious disease, as well as medical interviews and advice to prevent mental and physical disorders among employees working long hours.
We are also taking steps to improve health awareness through consultations and guidance by occupational healthcare workers that can help relieve employees’ health concerns and encourage regular exercise.
In addition, we are proactively implementing the stress checks specified by law at all business sites in Japan—even those employing fewer than 50 employees, which are only required to make efforts toward compliance—to promote awareness of stress among all employees. Group analysis results from these stress checks will also be used by workplace health and safety committee members, occupational healthcare workers, and human resources divisions to improve work environments. In combination, these efforts are expected to help prevent mental health issues and revitalize workplaces.

In 2008, Hitachi began working with the world’s leading nuclear power plant vendors to develop voluntary, private principles of conduct covering the exportation of nuclear power plants and reactors. The “Nuclear Power Plant and Reactor Exporters’ Principles of Conduct” were formally revealed on September 15, 2011. They were adopted by all involved in its development, and we have also indicated our adherence to them.
Regarding our employees and other persons employed at nuclear sites under the Hitachi. 
Group umbrella, we perform exposure management based on our internal management systems, and perform evaluation of radiation damage (dose management).
For health management in particular, our management indicators for radiation exposure are stricter than those set by Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare. We monitor physical and mental health along with exposure dose even for employees of partner companies, and an occupational doctor from Hitachi visits sites to perform examinations and offer health advice.

Distributed CEO’s human rights message to. 
Approx. 258,000employees. 
In order to ensure respect for human rights not just among Hitachi’s employees but throughout its supply chain and among other stakeholders, Hitachi formulated the Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy, created an accompanying framework, and promotes educational and awareness-raising activities as well as the use of grievance mechanisms to address employee concerns throughout the Hitachi Group. In recent years, Hitachi has focused on human rights due diligence and continues to construct and refine systems for accurately grasping and minimizing risk. In fiscal 2018, too, we expanded our business and human rights initiatives both inside and outside Japan.
Hitachi’s Approach Respect for Human Rights Throughout the Value Chain. 
Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy Policy. 
Hitachi believes that respecting human rights is our responsibility as a global company and indispensable in conducting business. To this end, in May 2013 we formulated the Hitachi Group. 
Human Rights Policy. In this policy, we clarify our understanding of human rights as being, at a minimum, those outlined in the International Bill of Human Rights*1 and the International Labour. 
Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. This policy shapes. 
Hitachi’s approach to meeting the responsibility to respect human rights, including implementing human rights due diligence*2 in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human. 
Rights,*3 providing appropriate education to employees, adhering to laws and regulations in all the regions and countries where we operate, and seeking ways to honor the principles of international human rights when faced with conflicts between internationally recognized human rights standards and national laws.
In fiscal 2014, Hitachi added the perspective of business and human rights to its existing structures and policies and developed guidelines on human rights due diligence that explain procedures for everyday business practices. Based on these guidelines, we initiated human rights due diligence in such areas as procurement in fiscal 2015 and human resources in fiscal 2016, assessing and prioritizing the risks of human rights that Group employees and people in the supply chain are likely to confront as well as reviewing measures to reduce such risks.
We recognize the importance of risk assessment based on individual business environments, including business types and models, alongside cross-sectional risk assessment at the Group level. Accordingly, in fiscal 2018 we assessed and prioritized human rights risks at some business units and Group companies and laid the groundwork for a mid-term action plan.

We have also set forth in other relevant internal regulations our policy of respecting human rights, including the rights of children.

Framework for Human Rights Frameworks and Systems. 
Hitachi, Ltd. established the Corporate Human Rights Promotion Committee in fiscal 1981 to gauge the impact of business activities on stakeholders’ human rights and to deliberate on mechanisms and policies for preventing human rights violations. The executive officer in charge of human capital chairs this body, whose members include representatives from sales, procurement, human resources, CSR, and other corporate units. Hitachi is improving its. 
Group-wide human rights awareness based on the guidelines discussed and written by the. 
Corporate Human Rights Promotion Committee. Policies decided through these deliberations are shared with business unit and business site committees, led by business unit presidents and division heads. Each business site provides consultation services through which employees can seek consultation on issues such as sexual harassment and works to ensure that those who come forward are treated with respect and dignity.
As a result of initiating human rights due diligence in our human resources divisions, we reconfirmed the importance of grievance mechanisms. Not only do such mechanisms encourage employees to express concerns over working environments, they also help Hitachi grasp and identify violations of human rights and prevent the recurrence of such violations. In fiscal 2018 we explored ways of streamlining grievance mechanisms based on the common requirements across the Group in accordance with international standards, and from fiscal 2019 we will begin the process of rolling out changes globally.
In a practice launched in fiscal 2014, we distribute a human rights message by President and. 
CEO Toshiaki Higashihara every year on December 10, Human Rights Day. In fiscal 2018, approximately 258,000 executives and employees at Hitachi, Ltd. and Group companies in and outside Japan received an e-mail message regarding global trends in human rights, Hitachi’s human rights policy and activities, and the importance of individual employees respecting human rights in their work.

In accordance with these goals, the training is provided to all employees once every three years on average and regularly revised based on human rights trends worldwide.
Executive officers from Hitachi, Ltd. participate in annual officer training sessions on human rights. In July 2018, 32 executive officers participated in a session titled “From CSR as an Ethics to ESG as a Strategy—Based on the Perspective of Human Rights,” led by Mariko Kawaguchi, chief researcher, Research Division, Daiwa Institute of Research Ltd. The session covered a wide range of issues from an investor’s viewpoint, including the importance of human rights in the new framework of international society, the global-level challenges that we face, and the background to the growing ESG investment movement.
Human Rights Due Diligence Initiatives Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
In our Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy, we pledged to develop mechanisms for and to continue the implementation of human rights due diligence. Toward that end, in fiscal 2013 some business sites launched pilot programs for human rights due diligence to identify key issues that need to be clarified for Group-wide implementation while also analyzing and evaluating human rights risks in six ASEAN countries. Based on the results of these pilot programs, in fiscal 2014.

Hitachi Sustainability Report 2019 we developed a document offering guidelines for implementing human rights due diligence in collaboration with the nonprofit organization Shift.
In fiscal 2015, we initiated human rights due diligence in the procurement divisions, whose activities are at risk of negatively impacting the human rights of workers in the supply chain and local communities. In fiscal 2017, we incorporated the results of human rights due diligence into the revision of our CSR procurement guidelines for suppliers while also thoroughly revising the questions on the check sheet used in supplier CSR monitoring (self-checks), to better grasp the issues related to workers’ rights at suppliers as well as health and safety and the environment.
Fiscal 2016 also saw the launch of human rights due diligence for human resources divisions at Hitachi. The operations in those divisions touch on many issues connected to human rights for employees, including working hours, employee treatment, and health and safety. Human rights risks for employees were assessed and prioritized, and mitigation strategies were explored. They also investigated grievance mechanisms, analyzing existing procedures and exploring ideas for improvement. In fiscal 2018 we initiated human rights due diligence in some business units and. 
Group companies, assessing the risks of human rights violations for each operation, prioritizing action points, and reviewing measures to reduce such risks. Going forward, Hitachi will further promote human rights due diligence across the Group.

Addressing the Risks of Child and Forced Labor Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
The Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct clearly express Hitachi’s firm stance against the use of child labor or forced labor either in Group companies or along our supply chain. The company president’s human rights message for fiscal 2017 also addressed the issues of forced labor and human trafficking, clearly stating that Hitachi as a global company must take preventive measures in its business and supply chain. Recognizing the growing risks of forced labor amid the ongoing globalization of business, Hitachi also developed an e-learning program for all Group executives and employees on the subject of human rights. The program draws on specific case studies to convey the importance of preventing forced labor and human trafficking problems before they occur.
Hitachi’s CSR procurement guidelines for suppliers also clearly forbid the use of child labor or forced labor. As part of our efforts to raise awareness all along the supply chain, these guidelines are distributed to tier 1 suppliers of business units and Group companies. In fiscal 2016, a four-part webinar*1 series was also held for employees responsible for procurement and human resources in Southeast Asia, where the risk of forced labor is expected to be higher. Speakers from nongovernmental organizations and businesses implementing advanced countermeasures were invited to lead the webinars.
In fiscal 2017, we visited one of our suppliers in Malaysia with the US nonprofit organization. 
BSR (Business for Social Responsibility) to conduct an assessment on migrant workers, who are socially vulnerable and often said to be exploited by forced labor. The assessment was based on interviews with managers of human resources and production divisions, recruitment agencies, and migrant workers, along with inspection of the factories and dormitories.
In fiscal 2018 we assessed the risks of forced labor at about 100 offices of Hitachi Group companies located in seven Southeast Asian countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the. 
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam). The assessment was conducted with the cooperation of Verité Southeast Asia (VSEA), an internationally active nonprofit organization, using a checklist for suppliers revised in fiscal 2017 based on the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct, formerly the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC).

Value Chain Management. 
As an enterprise that engages in businesses activities in many regions around the world, Hitachi pays close attention to sustainability in the value chain from its suppliers to business partners and customers. Not only do we require that all suppliers strictly follow our CSR procurement policies, we also carry out CSR monitoring (self-checks) and audits to minimize procurement risks. Additionally, as well as developing products and services that all customers can feel secure using, we disclose information in a detailed and appropriate manner. We are also taking proactive steps on privacy protections for the use of personal data, a topic of much interest in recent years.
Hitachi’s Approach Responsible Procurement. 
Basic Procurement Guidelines Policy. 
We base our procurement activities on the Hitachi Guidelines for Procurement Activities, while sharing global supply chain issues within the Group. All Group companies follow these guidelines.
The guidelines were created in line with the United Nations Global Compact and include the elimination of discrimination in employment and occupation, the rejection of all forms of child and forced labor, and environmental protection activities. Suppliers are selected strictly in accordance with the Hitachi Guidelines for Procurement Activities. We intend to revise these guidelines in accordance with revisions to the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct and the new Hitachi Group.

Given the global reach of Hitachi’s business, there is a growing likelihood of supply chain risks creating management problems, and the Hitachi Group is working hard to identify and mitigate these risks beforehand as much as possible.
CSR supply chain management and green procurement policies and initiatives are discussed within Hitachi’s Value Chain Integration Division, which is headed by the chief procurement officer (CPO) and reports directly to the president of Hitachi, Ltd. Policies and initiatives adopted after this discussion are shared throughout the Group through the Hitachi Group CSR/BCP. 
Procurement Committee, which includes members from business units and CSR/BCP. 
Procurement Committees at key Group companies.
To address the issue of chemical substances in products, we have built A Gree’Net, an. 
Internet-based green procurement system for collecting information about substances and other environment-related data from suppliers as soon as it becomes available. The goal is to manage chemicals carefully. Under this system, in the past, we encouraged suppliers to use the. 
MSDSPlus*1/AIS*2 reporting templates published by the Joint Article Management Promotion. 
Consortium*3 to achieve smoother and more efficient transmission of information.
Because the reporting templates became invalid at the end of June 2018, we currently recommend the use of chemSHERPA*4-CI/AI, a common scheme that facilitates transmission of information on chemical substances in products throughout the supply chain.
*1 MSDSPlus: A format for reporting chemical substances contained in products created by upstream companies (chemical manufacturers) for midstream companies (molded product manufacturers, etc.). *2 AIS: A format for reporting chemical substances contained in products created by midstream companies (molded product manufacturers, etc.) for downstream companies (assembly manufacturers, etc.). *3 Joint Article Management Promotion Consortium (JAMP): Established in September 2006 as a cross-industry promotion association of 17 companies endorsing the idea that “it is essential for the enhancement of industrial competitiveness to ensure proper management of information on chemical substances contained in articles (parts and final products), and to establish and popularize a concrete mechanism for smooth disclosure and transmission of such information in supply chains.” *4 chemSHERPA: A standard developed by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry to facilitate the management of chemical substances in products by creating a shared transmission scheme throughout the supply chain. The chemSHERPA-CI standard is applicable to chemical substances contained in chemical products and chemSHERPA-AI to those contained in molded products.

Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
A key element of the Hitachi Group Vision is to improve the competitiveness of our value chain based on partnerships with our suppliers. Given our business aim to expand internationally, we need to extend our procurement globally, looking toward increasing local production for local consumption.
We have appointed procurement officers to oversee local procurement in China, the rest of. 
Asia, Europe, and the Americas. These officers carry out activities such as CSR audits, CSR monitoring (self-checks), and CSR procurement seminars in their respective regions. In this way, we are expanding our suppliers in emerging nations while also strengthening our response to. 
CSR-related risks expected to arise from the global expansion of our supply chain.
Local procurement officers are also responsible for addressing environmental risks in China.
Through the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, an environmental NGO, the officers obtain information about polluting enterprises made public by China’s central and regional government bodies. They use this information not only for screening businesses who have transactions with these enterprises but also for urging the enterprises themselves to make improvements.

Sharing Procurement Policies Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
To ensure that the Hitachi Group CSR Procurement Guidelines’ provisions are strictly followed, we distribute the fully revised fiscal 2016 edition to the approximately 30,000 suppliers of Hitachi business units and Group companies, from whom we request acknowledgment of suppliers’ understanding in writing. Tier 1 suppliers are further asked to confirm that tier 2 suppliers also follow the provisions in the guidelines. Additionally, recognizing the global nature of our suppliers, we make the guidelines available not only in Japanese but also in English, Chinese, and Thai, the latter language added in fiscal 2018 in response to increasing labor and human rights risks in southeast Asia.
To procure parts and materials manufactured with reduced environmental impact, so that suppliers help to protect the environment, in fiscal 1998, we led the industry in developing Green. 
Procurement Guidelines. These define our basic position on procuring parts and products that do not have a negative impact on the global environment, as well as our requirements of suppliers, so that we can work together to promote green procurement. The guidelines set out supplier requirements for environmental conservation, including building an environmental management system and acquiring certifications. There are also requirements for reducing the environmental impact of products supplied to Hitachi, such as conserving resources and energy in production, recycling, managing chemical substances, and fully disclosing related information.
There is a global trend toward tighter regulations on chemical substances. In fiscal 2013, we reviewed our categories for controlled chemical substances in our Green Procurement Guidelines to comply with the stipulations on restricted substances, authorized substances, and substances of very high concern (SVHCs) in the European Union’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation for managing chemical substances within the. 
EU. Specific changes include: (1) moving some chemicals to the prohibited substances list, (2) further breaking down the controlled substances list, and (3) adopting the industry association list. In preparation for the EU’s RoHS directive that banned four types of phthalates in July 2019, we banned their use from January of that year. We also distributed the latest version of the Green. 
Procurement Guidelines through Group companies and business units to suppliers to ensure that they are fully informed.
Hitachi Group CSR Procurement Guidelines. 
Hitachi Group Green Procurement Guidelines. 
Implementation of CSR Monitoring (Self-Checks) Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
To monitor how well Hitachi’s CSR supply chain management philosophy has been adopted by our suppliers, since fiscal 2007 we have asked key suppliers to conduct CSR Monitoring (self-checks) using the JEITA Supply Chain CSR Deployment Guidebook and detailed checklists.
After collecting and analyzing the results, we provide feedback for the business operations related to the suppliers, and then work with those involved in the operations to resolve issues related to the suppliers. Since fiscal 2011, we have expanded the scope to include suppliers in. 
China and the rest of Asia, and from fiscal 2017 all checklists were fully updated in accordance with the revisions made to the Hitachi Group CSR Procurement Guidelines. In fiscal 2018 we asked 345 suppliers inside and outside Japan to conduct CSR monitoring (self-check, although simplified in some cases) and received survey replies from them. The survey results allowed us to identify labor-related issues requiring attention, and we will take precautionary measures to prevent issues arising.
Implementation of CSR Audits Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
Since July 2012, Hitachi, Ltd. has been auditing the manufacturing bases of its and Group companies’ suppliers in China and the rest of Asia. In fiscal 2018, we conducted CSR and environment audits of 24 suppliers in China.
For these audits, we engaged external evaluators such as the experienced CSR auditing company Intertek Certification.*1 Our audits are based on the international SA8000 certification standard developed by Social Accountability International (SAI), an American CSR evaluation institution. These audits investigate our workplace practices, and an RBA-recognized auditor checks suppliers’ CSR initiatives from the perspectives of labor and human rights, health and safety, the environment, and ethics.
No major infringements were found at the suppliers audited in fiscal 2018, but some small areas needing improvement were noted, such as overtime work exceeding stipulated rules (18 suppliers), failure to conduct periodic inspections of machinery and equipment (5), and insufficient management of hazardous waste (3). The relevant suppliers were requested to submit 116.

Human Rights Due Diligence in Procurement Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
Starting in fiscal 2015, the Hitachi Group Procurement Division began implementing human rights due diligence based on the Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy. With the assistance of the consulting services of the nonprofit organization Shift, we have created a working group centered on the procurement and CSR divisions at Hitachi, Ltd., which serve as the corporate divisions overseeing activities throughout the Group, including the procurement and CSR divisions of two in-house companies, now called business units, four Group companies and the CSR division of. 
Hitachi Asia. The working group has evaluated human rights risks within the supply chain, set priorities, and considered measures for reducing risks.
In fiscal 2016, we published the fully revised Hitachi Group CSR Procurement Guidelines based on results obtained from human rights due diligence activities in fiscal 2015 as well as input from a range of sources and perspectives, including Hitachi Europe, Hitachi (China), and outside experts.
In fiscal 2017, Hitachi further incorporated input from various perspectives into the revised. 
CSR Monitoring (self-check) checklists for suppliers to prevent supply chain risks. As well as strengthening and improving existing initiatives in this way, we used the results obtained from the checklists to deepen our communication with suppliers. As part of our efforts to eliminate the use of forced labor, we visited one of our suppliers in Malaysia with members of nonprofit organization. 
BSR (Business for Social Responsibility) to conduct an assessment on immigrant workers, who are often subject to forced labor. The results of the assessment were shared with the supplier and related businesses, and we are urging the supplier to improve working conditions where such improvement is deemed necessary.
In fiscal 2018, procurement officers from European Group companies formed the Responsible. 
Supply Chain Working Group, sharing perspectives and issues on human rights relevant to procurement divisions along with Hitachi’s CSR procurement policies, and discussing plans for future activity.
In cooperation with outside experts, we will continue to enhance suppliers’ understanding of the expectations of Hitachi Group procurement departments and, at the same time, promote capacity building at suppliers and take other necessary measures.
Respect for Human Rights Throughout the Value Chain improvement action plans, and Hitachi, Ltd., together with Group companies, will work with and advise the suppliers until they complete the planned improvements.

Holding CSR Procurement Seminars Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
In order to share the philosophy of Hitachi among our suppliers, in fiscal 2015 we introduced a new initiative to provide suppliers directly with information in a face-to-face format, in addition to the information shared on the Hitachi website as well as our CSR monitoring (self-checks),
CSR audits, and other measures. The most recent of these face-to-face events was held in. 
March 2019 at our CSR and Green Procurement Seminar held for Hitachi Group partners in East and South China. The event was attended by 176 people from 126 companies. At the seminar,
Hitachi explained topics including its fundamental CSR philosophy, the CSR audit situation, regulatory trends under Chinese environmental laws, and Hitachi’s related policies. Feedback from participants included a comment from one person who was “impressed by the emphasis the company places not only on monozukuri craftsmanship but also on fulfilling its social responsibility in a range of areas.” Another participant “gained a sense that profitability is not the sole aim and that it is important to adhere to environmental laws.” As reflected in the comments, the seminar served to deepen the understanding of Hitachi initiatives related to CSR and green procurement.

Conflict Minerals Procurement Policy Policy. 
Hitachi released a Conflict Minerals Procurement Policy in September 2013. Our Request to Our. 
Suppliers, based on this policy, is published on our website as a clear statement of our position.
In fiscal 2016, we revised this policy to ensure that procurement of components incorporating conflict minerals does not benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or adjoining countries. The policy now explicitly lays out the measures to be implemented, including inquiries based on international guidelines, to ensure responsible procurement.
Hitachi Group Conflict Minerals Procurement Policy Conflict Minerals There are numerous types of mineral resources buried within the lands of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in central Africa, and its neighbouring countries. Ores containing minerals such as tin which is used in solders to secure electronic parts to printed circuit boards, tantalum which is used in capacitors, tungsten which is used in superhard materials, and gold which is used in lead frames can be found in this region. The locals extract these ores, which traders and brokers export to other countries in order to earn valuable foreign currencies, but part of those foreign currencies are forcibly collected and used as funds to purchase weapons by armed groups that repeatedly engage in conflict and violate human rights in the same region, which has become a major problem. As such, the minerals listed above are called “conflict minerals”.
Procurement Policy The policy for procurement departments in all Hitachi Group companies have always been and will continue to be to ensure that procurement activities do not result or aid in conflicts within the same region and that the armed groups described above do not benefit from those activities, while continuing responsible procurement activities of minerals that are not related to the conflicts in the region based on local laws. Additionally, we will continue to support the practice of due diligence based on the “OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas” among companies. With these in mind, Hitachi Group would like to request all our suppliers to utilise the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template developed by RBA/GeSI to continue checking the country of origin and supply chain of minerals, and also to procure from the CFS (Conflict Free Smelter)*1 listed within.
*1 CFS (Conflict Free Smelter): A list of smelters who have been identified as “not being involved in the conflict within the same region” by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), an organization that was founded by the RBA/GeSI, which is a group that aims to solve the conflict minerals problem.
Hitachi Group Conflict Minerals Procurement Policy. 
Conflict Minerals Response Framework Frameworks and Systems. 
Sales divisions, business groups, plants, procurement divisions, and other divisions within individual business units and Hitachi Group companies work together to respond to investigation requests and inquiries relating to conflict minerals. We also strive to grasp developments in conflict mineral-related laws and regulations in each country and region and what global society demands of enterprises, working to share information within the Group.

Response to the Conflict Mineral Issue Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
Based on the Guidelines for Procurement Activities, each Hitachi business unit and Group company investigates its use of conflict minerals and reports the results to customers when requested. Supply chain investigations are carried out with the cooperation of the relevant entities’ sales, procurement, and CSR divisions. In 2017, Hitachi, Ltd. and five key Group companies (Hitachi Metals, Hitachi Chemicals, Hitachi High-Technologies, Hitachi Automotive Systems, and. 
Hitachi Industrial Equipment Systems) performed investigations and replied to a total of 1,422 requests from customers.

Quality and Safety Management. 
Hitachi’s Approach to Quality Assurance Activities Policy. 
Providing products and services that our customers can use with confidence, along with meeting the requirements and quality standards of our customers in order to achieve this, are important values shared by all our employees and codified in the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct. Our fundamental philosophy for quality assurance activities is outlined in the Quality Assurance. 
Standards in our corporate regulations, and each of our employees pursues quality assurance activities according to this approach.
Maintaining the values of Harmony, Sincerity, and Pioneering Spirit that comprise the Hitachi. 
Founding Spirit, as well as adhering to basics and ethics and putting right and wrong before profits and losses, we place great emphasis on Sincerity in quality assurance activities as part of earning trust in our products.
One integral aspect of this is our unique and longstanding practice of ochibo hiroi, which means “gleaning” in English and involves learning from failure to further develop our technologies.
When an incident occurs, our executive officers take the lead in examining things from the cus- tomer’s perspective, not only investigating the technical causes but also thoroughly discussing the process, framework, and motivating factors leading up to occurrence, along with ways to prevent reoccurrence, in order to improve our product reliability and customer satisfaction.

Complying with Technical Laws Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
To supply our customers with products that they can use with confidence, we comply with all product safety and technical laws, including those covering environmental consciousness and safety labels. We distribute information on product regulations worldwide, along with amendment trends and enforcement dates, among Hitachi Group companies. We have also created guidelines for assessment of technical laws and quality assurance systems, sharing them throughout the. 
Group. The guidelines include information on the two themes of clarifying product-specific laws (the product-specific laws map) and regulatory compliance activities and continuous improvement of processes, based on our product compliance management system.
Product Safety Activities Policy Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
Hitachi’s Product Safety Assurance Guidelines state that our highest priority is the safety of our customers, and, based on these guidelines, we promote activities to ensure safety across the Group.
As changes in social norms and the environment bring about the need for higher standards of safety, we are crafting even higher safety standards through Group-wide activities to increase trust in Hitachi, sharing the latest practical cases within the Group, and cross-evaluating the product safety activities of each division.
We are also proactively working to disclose safety information on the use of our products and establish the Guide for Preparing User Instruction Manuals in order to improve risk communication with our customers.
Hitachi is committed to the delivery of safe products and services by combining expertise and technologies in such varied areas as planning, research, design, manufacturing, quality assurance, and maintenance. The safety of our customers’ life, health, and property is the top priority in product development. Therefore, we verify safety at every step, from development and production to sales and maintenance. We also conduct risk assessments from a wide perspective in collaboration with related business units and research laboratories. In responding to these risks, we ensure safety by means of measures to reduce risk through design (fundamental safety design), protective measures (safeguards), and usage information (product manuals), in order of priority.
To ensure that quality and reliability are maintained, we are strengthening our quality assurance activities from the perspectives of organization and management, technology, and human resources in every process—from planning and development to design, manufacturing, testing, delivery, and maintenance.
Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct. 
Framework for Quality Assurance Frameworks and Systems. 
To ensure full control over quality governance, we have separated the quality assurance division from the manufacturing division in every business unit and Group company, creating a framework for activity in which our customers’ safety and trust are the top priorities. Since fiscal 2018, in order to strengthen this framework further, we have reinforced the report lines from BU and. 
Group company quality assurance divisions to the quality assurance division at our head office, independent from all business divisions, establishing systems for close information sharing between the two. We have also strengthened governance by giving greater authority to the quality assurance division at our head office.
Furthermore, to share quality activities and current challenges in our expanding services business, we have newly established a Service and Software Quality Enhancement Division.
By bringing the software development capabilities and expertise in strengthening trust of our solutions divisions to our product divisions (embedded software development divisions), we aim to increase trust in our embedded software even further.
Accident Prevention Activities Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
Under our approach of making prevention the duty of quality assurance, we are working beyond recurrence prevention and striving toward preventing accidents from occurring in the first place.
Closely following the changes in a range of business activities, we anticipate quality issues on the horizon across the entire Group and plan our quality activities accordingly.

We conduct product safety risk assessment as well as testing worst-case scenarios—for example, deliberately setting a fire inside a consumer appliance to confirm that the fire will not spread outside it. Furthermore, along with each product’s full manual, we include a quick start guide summarizing key features and operations, and make step-by-step how-to videos available on our corporate website as well.
We will continue to make all our consumer appliances even safer, using our own voluntary action plan for product safety, so that customers can use our products with confidence.
Handling Product Accidents Frameworks and Systems. 
When a product accident occurs, the division responsible acts swiftly to resolve the problem and ensure absolute safety from the customer’s perspective. For an especially severe accident, we report to government agencies in line with legal requirements and publish the incident information on our website and through other channels. At the same time, we promptly submit a status report to top management, ensuring fast and appropriate action at all companies across the Group.
When we determine that retroactive action is necessary, we notify customers via newspaper advertising and websites in order to carry out the necessary repair or replacement program.

Responding to Personal Data Protection Laws Around the World Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
With the increasing risk of privacy violation in recent years due to the advent of the digital age following advances in IT and the globalization of socio-economic activities, lawmakers are actively seeking to create and modify relevant laws and legislation in countries and regions around the world. The Hitachi Group pays close attention to relevant laws and legislation on a global basis, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), making efforts to comply with them across the Group. It also monitors relevant legislation and social trends and takes action in response when necessary.
Use of Personal Data and Protection of Privacy. 
Hitachi’s Approach to the Use of Data and the Protection of Privacy Policy. 
The term “personal data” has come to be used to mean any data associated with individuals, such as location information and purchase history, irrespective of whether or not such data can legally be defined as “personal information.” The use of personal data can be expected to create value going forward, but the privacy of individuals must also be considered carefully. In addition, as the amount of personal data collected continues to increase in the IoT era, risks related to privacy are also likely to change.
In order to create value through safe and secure use of personal data, in 2014 we began efforts to protect privacy in the use of such data, mainly in departments related to information and telecommunications systems.
Framework for Implementing Privacy Protection Frameworks and Systems. 
In departments related to information and telecommunications systems, which lead our digital business, we have assigned a personal data manager responsible for managing privacy protection and established a privacy protection advisory committee to support risk assessments and develop countermeasures based on knowledge and expertise of privacy protection. Under this system, our employees implement privacy impact assessments for processes where personal data will be handled and take measures to prevent privacy violations. When employees find it difficult to assess risks on their own, or conclude that risks of privacy violation are high, the privacy protection advisory committee will extend support to deal with the case and help reduce risks.

Seeking to Ensure the Safety and Security of Consumers and Customers Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
To meet consumers’ expectations around privacy protection, Hitachi regularly conducts consumer opinion surveys on the use of personal data in big data businesses in order to understand changing consumer perceptions and take them into consideration when updating privacy protection measures.
Hitachi has conducted privacy impact assessments in many business fields. In fiscal 2018, we conducted 180 assessments in a wide range of fields, including finance, public services, social infrastructure, and industry/logistics. In order to leverage the expertise built on these experiences when conducting business with our customers and promote social consensus on the use of personal data, we have made publicly available a whitepaper on Hitachi’s privacy protection initiatives in the use of personal data, which summarizes our privacy protection efforts.
Customer Satisfaction. 
Hitachi’s CS Improvement Approach Policy. 
Using the Customer Satisfaction Management Guidelines, one of the pillars of the company’s business management, Hitachi continues to improve customer satisfaction (CS) with the goal of creating innovation through collaboration with customers.
Customer Satisfaction Management Guidelines 1. Listen to our customers, who determine the value of products and services 2. Review information from our customers is another source of improvement 3. Offer prices and quality that are competitive 4. Respond rapidly to keep our promises to our customers 5. Adopt systems that prevent accidents and minimize their impact. 
Formulated in 1994. 
Applying Advertisement Guidelines Policy. 
Based on its Customer Satisfaction Management Guidelines, Hitachi, Ltd. applies advertisement guidelines to ensure that its advertising activities comply with laws and regulations showing proper consideration for society as a whole. We will continue to create advertisements that reflect ongoing changes in society, that provide customers with clear and concise messages, and that are appropriate for a company committed to contributing to society.
As issues that arise from advertisement activities can have broad impact on the company, we have established in each business unit a framework for constantly evaluating the acceptability of expressions used in advertisements, in collaboration with a division that stands independent of the ad production line. Following this institutional check, we also evaluate advertisements to ensure that they are socially appropriate.
We designed our advertisement guidelines to be flexibly adjusted and applied to the entire. 
Hitachi Group’s diverse operations. At our business locations outside Japan, where languages and customs vary, we strive to ensure appropriate advertising activities by confirming all items on the checklist included in the guidelines.
Framework for Reflecting Customers’ Voices Frameworks and Systems. 
The sales and marketing divisions at Hitachi, Ltd. use customer input in developing management, product, and solution strategies. We identify key customers who will help grow our business, then assign an account manager (AM) to each one. The AMs serve as customers’ “portals” into. 
Hitachi Group companies in Japan, and the whole Group works with them to build closer relations with customers and to boost CS.
We hold executive seminars for local customers at our operations across Japan. Through direct dialogue with customers participating in these seminars and lectures, we incorporate their expectations for Hitachi and their opinions into product strategies.
To accelerate collaborative creation with customers in Hitachi’s evolving Social Innovation. 
Business, we also hold Hitachi Social Innovation Forums in and outside Japan, providing lectures, exhibits, and more. Our sales teams invite our customers to these events to deepen their understanding of Hitachi’s business. We also collect feedback from these events to improve our future operations.

Community. 
Our diverse operations span the globe and involve a wide range of communities. To build long-term relationships with all communities involved in our business and to contribute to their development, we carry out various social contribution activities in the key fields of human development, the environment, and community support. In recent years, we have focused on STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education to foster the next generation of human capital who will lead the future, and in fiscal 2018 we carried out a diverse range of activities drawing on the respective strengths of each Group company.
Hitachi’s Approach Social Contribution Activities. 
Policy on Social Contribution Activities Policy. 
In an effort to achieve the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, Hitachi is working to create social and environmental value through the Social Innovation Business. Social contribution activities lead to the creation of social and environmental value and can support the sustainable development of society and continued business growth. We thus actively promote activities in the key fields of human development, the environment, and community support, which are outlined in the policy on social contribution activities shared by the Group. As a company aiming to solve social issues through innovation, we believe we have an important mission to foster not only our own human capital but also people in the fields of science and technology more broadly. Also, as a global company, we believe it is essential for employees to actively volunteer their time to address local issues and needs, building trust with the local community as a good corporate citizen. Volunteering has benefits for employees as well, as it can heighten their awareness of social issues and—by helping resolve those issues—enhance their motivation to work. This can, in turn, become a driving force for the Social Innovation Business and our many other operations.

STEM Education to Develop Engineers in the United Kingdom (Hitachi Rail Ltd.)
In response to a serious shortage of engineers in the United Kingdom, Hitachi Rail launched a brand new educational program in October 2018, partnering with Primary Engineer, a non-profit organization that delivers STEM educational programs for education institutions, targeted at 5- to 10-year-old primary school pupils.
The program delivers training to teachers with the company’s engineers at about 50 primary schools in Ashford, Doncaster, Bristol, Newton Aycliffe, and West London, where Hitachi’s railway business sites are located. Approximately 3,000 pupils will benefit from this educational experience in the 2018–19 academic year.
This program is funded for three years by Hitachi Rail. In year two, the existing 50 schools will be supplied with the materials to continue with the program while a new cohort of 50 schools will be trained and enabled to run the rail-oriented engineering projects in the classroom. Within the three year program, over 16,000 pupils will have engaged with this program.
Hitachi Rail recognizes the importance of working with schools to raise children’s awareness of exciting career opportunities in engineering fields. Therefore, this STEM program is linked to the school curriculum, implemented by a team of school teachers and the company’s engineers.
Using rail train models, the children learn rail engineering directly from the engineers of Hitachi Rail.

There is a growing interest in programming in Japan, as courses in the subject will start in earnest at elementary and junior high schools under the education reforms of 2020.
Believing in the importance of STEM education to foster the next generation of IT personnel,
Hitachi Consulting has developed an original programming curriculum that draws on the company’s. 
IT skills and content to cultivate an ability to think logically. The classes, taught by volunteering employees, are for the children of Hitachi Group employees in grades three to six and are held at the offices of Hitachi Consulting and Hitachi, Ltd. Classes were held four times in 2018 with the participation of approximately 100 children and their parents.
Participating pupils celebrate the completion of the program.
Working with an original textbook, schoolchildren use tablets to learn a basic robot operating program. The program is then applied to run ball-shaped robots on a course the children themselves have created. This exercise is intended not only to stimulate interest in IT but, through the sharing of the programs the children created, to cultivate their presentation skills. Going forward, there are plans to fine tune the program for different age groups and to hold classes in cities other than Tokyo. Consideration is also being given to inviting the participation of children outside Japan by linking classrooms via the internet.

Corporate Governance. 
Hitachi not only strives to ensure the legality, soundness, and transparency of its business but also endeavors to respond rapidly to constantly changing economic and social conditions and efficiently conduct operations. We seek to increase corporate value by formulating and executing business strategies to enable the Group to demonstrate its collective strength, bolstering mutual collaboration within the Group, and improving management oversight of Group companies. We maintain and reinforce a management structure enabling us to fulfill our social responsibilities in line with the Corporate Governance Guidelines, formulated to provide a framework for corporate governance and direction for our reinforcement efforts.
Hitachi’s Approach Basic Approach Policy. 
Hitachi is a company with nominating committee, etc. under the Companies Act of Japan.
In June 2003, we changed our organizational design, separating the oversight of management from execution of management.

In June 2012, we ensured that 7 of the 13 members of our Board of Directors were independent directors*1, and that some of these independent directors were non-Japanese. These changes will help us to establish management that reflects diverse global perspectives and strengthen our supervisory functions.
Starting in June 2015, Corporate Governance Code of Japan (the “Code”) was applied to companies listed on Japanese stock exchanges. In 2012, Hitachi formulated and published. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines as a set of enhancing principles and as a framework for corporate governance that includes criteria for determining the roles and composition of the. 
Board of Directors, director appropriateness and the independence of independent directors.
Hitachi agrees with the basic approach of the Code, which is that the Code’s appropriate implementation will contribute to the development and success of companies, investors and the. 
Japanese economy as a whole through individual companies’ self-motivated actions, so as to achieve sustainable growth and increase corporate value over the medium- to long-term. Moving forward, Hitachi will work to further strengthen corporate governance.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting Frameworks and Systems. 
To ensure the reliability of its consolidated financial reporting, the Hitachi Group is establishing and implementing relevant internal controls. We evaluate their effectiveness by adhering to stan- dards for the evaluation of internal controls related to financial reporting that are generally accepted as fair and reasonable.
Furthermore, we have established the J-SOX Committee with the goal of raising the effectiveness of these internal controls. This committee evaluates internal control effectiveness and establishes frameworks designed to improve and strengthen them.

Enhanced Collaboration Through Tripartite Audits Frameworks and Systems. 
In pursuit of sustainable growth in corporate value, Hitachi’s Audit Committee and internal audit section collaborate with third-party accounting auditors to strengthen its “tripartite auditing,” which aims to increase the effectiveness of internal controls. Our Audit Committee takes the lead in this regard, as the three parties communicate closely to share risk information and assessments concerning risk response while securing transparency and ensuring appropriate checks and balances.

Building a More Effective and Efficient Auditing System Frameworks and Systems. 
Our Audit Committee formulates audit plans in accordance with its risk-based approaches and conducts audits for each consolidated business unit. Audit Committee members meet directly with business unit heads before the internal audit section’s audits are carried out. Then, these members inform the internal audit section about concerns and issues related to the implementation of business strategies aimed at achieving sustainable growth that require attention. At this time,
Hitachi also verifies matters that carry high levels of risk in terms of quality, measuring these risks through employee awareness surveys and thorough implementation of business strategies.
Hitachi’s internal audit section performs regular internal audits at each business site and location. This section reports directly to the CEO and is independent from organizations that are subject to its audits. The internal audit section also formulates audit plans based on past audit records and the most recent business circumstances. Additionally, this section performs audits upon receiving direction from the Audit Committee, ensuring their effectiveness.
The internal audit section at Hitachi is responsible for confirming the legality and appropriateness of all business operations, including those related to accounting, production management, sales, purchasing, IT systems, compliance and personnel labor. Furthermore, employees are well versed in the ideas and policies of our management and, acting on behalf of our management team, confirm whether operations are being carried out based on these ideas and policies and if business strategies are being implemented in a way that will efficiently lead to sustainable growth.
To further raise audit effectiveness, we implemented a “executive auditor” system in each of our 5 growth sectors (IT, energy, industry, mobility, smart life) in April 2019. We also established internal control systems which are headed by 139.

Hitachi Sustainability Report 2019 executive auditors who report to the vice presidents who manage each sector. Although these executive auditors do not act as legal agents under the Companies Act, they still assume responsibility for governance in each sector. They also function as a reporting line for statutory auditors at Hitachi subsidiaries who are legal agents under the Companies Act and are working to improve the efficiency of our internal control systems.
When conducting business audits, we use IT systems to expeditiously search for reference information contained within materials submitted prior to audit in an attempt to improve efficiency.
We are currently building a system that will allow our internal audit section to share information with professional accounting auditors using the Lumada platform’s data lake and expect it to be complete sometime in fiscal 2020. When reading audit reports submitted by the internal audit section, our CEO must be able to quickly understand the issues identified by these reports and make prompt judgments concerning whether immediate action is required. In the future, our internal audit section will continue to maintain its transparency and independence while working to improve audit efficiency as one member of our tripartite audit system.
Our accounting auditors perform audits that focus on the accuracy and reliability of our financial statements. First, they adopt a risk-based approach in response to the Group’s overall financial status. Applying this approach, they then determine the scope and methods of the audit, formulate an audit plan and share opinions with the Audit Committee. Next, based on the audit plan, they perform audits on each of the 5 growth sectors and the business units that comprise them, enabling effective and efficient understanding of data related to Hitachi’s finance department and each of its business segments. If, during the auditing process, our accounting auditors discover a degree of risk that could impact future financial statements significantly or issues that, even if monetarily small, could have a large qualitative effect, they share related information regarding these risks and issues and progress on response from related divisions with the Audit Committee and internal audit section. They also work to improve and raise the effectiveness of audits by submitting “management letters” containing points of concern and improvement suggestions through the accounting department. Recently, they have also been working to raise the efficiency of checks on the accuracy of numerical figures by using IT systems to investigate all cases, rather than performing test-checking through sampling.

Compliance. 
With the globalization of the economy, borderless corporative activities— spanning countries and regions with different governmental and economic frameworks, trade practices, and sets of values—are increasingly vital. Spreading understanding of and respect for norms among all Hitachi Group employees is a fundamental management issue as we seek to rigorously implement fair business practices and avoid risks around the globe. Hitachi has formulated in-house regulations in line with widely accepted international standards to govern important business practices such as bribery prevention and the ensuring of fair competition, and these regulations are conveyed and strictly enforced across the Hitachi Group. Additionally, as we pursue sustainable management, in order to realize value creation that contributes to the resolution of social issues, we disseminate and share both the Hitachi Group Identity, an integrated set of principles including our management vision and values, and the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct, which spell out decision-making procedures and actions for all Hitachi Group executives and employees.

Hitachi Global Compliance Program, a new integrated system of rules headed by the Hitachi. 
Group Codes of Conduct. This program is being implemented seamlessly across the global organization.
To implement this program, we have appointed a senior executive as the head of risk management for the entire Hitachi Group, to supervise management-level risk management executives from business units and key Group companies. Under this system, policies and measures are shared through the Compliance Management Conference, composed of these risk management executives. Each executive is assisted by a compliance manager who implements practical support measures. We also support Group companies outside Japan and have appointed compliance heads in 11 regions, responsible for implementing education and sharing information as well as arranging consultation services with outside attorneys.
Issues in the promotion of compliance measures are clarified through individual dialogue with business units and key Group companies, while the internal audit section regularly conducts. 
Group-wide reviews to verify that each area of compliance is being appropriately operated. In cases where these reviews identify necessary improvements, corrective measures are swiftly implemented. Hitachi, Ltd. also convenes an Advisory Committee of outside experts to gain new insights into compliance and apply them proactively in its own efforts.
Compliance Reporting System Frameworks and Systems. 
Hitachi has instituted a Compliance Reporting System allowing reports to be made to the compliance section or directly to external lawyers to prevent illegal and unethical behavior, to promptly address infractions, and to enhance its ability to self-regulate.
This system can be used not only by employees within the Hitachi Group but also by temporary staff and business partners, such as suppliers and distributors. Reports can be made about matters that contravene social justice, such as improper treatment—including acts that are illegal or against regulations—and human rights issues. Suspected violations of competition and. 
Sharing Our Codes of Conduct and Values Across the Group. 
The Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct Policy. 
Hitachi, Ltd. formulated the Hitachi, Ltd. Standards of Corporate Conduct in 1983, followed by the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct in 2010 that the entire Group pledges to uphold.
In April 2018, we revised the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct based on our philosophy that corporate activities should meet the needs of the times, such as the SDGs, toward a sustainable society, human rights and building a work environment, and various types of crisis management.
Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct. 
Ensuring Awareness of the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
The Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct are available in Japanese and 13 other languages— including English and Chinese—and shared with Hitachi Group employees around the world.
The Codes of Conduct are based on global standards in a range of areas, including the SDGs, and an e-learning tool has been made available in Japanese and 13 other languages to encourage a deeper understanding of them.
Additionally, the Hitachi Group performs an annual employee survey on awareness of matters such as business ethics and compliance as part of its efforts to cultivate a healthy corporate culture.
Compliance Framework Frameworks and Systems. 
As an organization with global business activities, Hitachi is expected to have a compliance framework based not only on the laws and regulations in the regions and countries where we operate but on global standards. In 2016, Hitachi reviewed and reorganized the regulations and guidelines including on compliance with competition laws, prevention of antisocial transactions, and prevention of bribery and corruption that had been set independently, and established the 142.

Thorough Export Controls Policy Frameworks and Systems. 
For basic export control policies, we have adopted the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct, which state: “We will help maintain international peace and security through compliance with all applicable laws and regulations concerning import and export, and will operate appropriately according to our internal rules and policies.” Hitachi, Ltd. has established Corporate Regulations concerning. 
Security Export Control based on this policy to carry out strict export control practices in line with relevant laws and regulations, screening all goods and technologies intended for export against such factors as destination countries and regions as well as intended end use and end users.
We provide guidance and educational support for the formulation of regulations and the establishment of frameworks to Hitachi Group companies in Japan and around the world to ensure that all Group companies follow the same export control policies in accordance with relevant laws and regulations.
At present, as part of our educational program for all Group companies within and outside. 
Japan, we host training sessions and workshops on export control in addition to the implementation of an e-learning program in Japanese, English, and Chinese. Moving forward, we will continue to make an effort so that export control is thoroughly enforced throughout the Group.
Solidifying the Hitachi Group Identity Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
To help us solve social issues through understanding and embodiment of the Hitachi Group. 
Identity, our brand management must engage everyone in the Group. We use channels, including our intranet, to ensure that Group employees are clearly aware of what needs to be done to express the Hitachi Group Identity. To promote understanding of and familiarity with the Hitachi. 
Group Identity and the Hitachi Brand, we launched the Inspiration of the Year Award in fiscal 2003 to share activities within Hitachi that have demonstrated the Hitachi Group Identity and anti-bribery laws can be reported anonymously.
The facts related to all reports are subject to thorough investigation and checking, and people who have identified themselves in the reports are informed of the investigation results. We make every effort to deal with situations as appropriate, including taking remedial action where necessary.
We will continue to maintain and review the system, prioritizing the protection of whistleblowers.
In fiscal 2018, in Japan, we applied for recognition under the Whistleblowing Compliance.

Policies for Preventing Bribery and Corrupt Practices Policy. 
Preventing bribery and corrupt practices is a big challenge for a company today. In 2008 Hitachi established rules against bribery and corruption for the HGCP along with guidelines indicating specific spending thresholds for entertainment, gifts, and other arrangements provided to public officials. We have striven to ensure strict compliance with these rules. In 2016 we introduced a policy banning facilitation payments, which had not been explicitly regulated, along with revisions including clarification of due diligence procedures for business partners.
Educational Activities for Preventing Bribery and Corrupt Practices Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
To ensure awareness of the HGCP rules and policies concerning prevention of bribery and corruption and compliance with competition law, we developed a global e-learning program about them and made it available in 12 languages—including Japanese, English, and Chinese— for use by Group companies worldwide. In fiscal 2018, more than 150,000 employees across the Hitachi Group, including executives, completed the e-learning program.
Competition Law Compliance Policy Policy. 
Hitachi engages in business based on the principles of conformance with the law and business ethics and fair and open competition. In 2015, we included business standards and guidelines related to these principles in the HGCP, in addition to rules concerning competition law.

(3) Group companies build sincere and positive relations of trust with the tax authorities in the regions where the companies do business, and strive to maintain and develop those relations.
Tax Compliance Initiatives Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
To ensure risk management for taxation in response to globalization, Hitachi follows relevant tax-related regulations applicable to the Group as a whole as well as rules for transfer pricing management. We also manage transfer pricing in accordance with the OECD Transfer Pricing. 
Guidelines and the laws and regulations on transfer pricing in each country or region where. 
Group companies are located.
Violations of Laws and Regulations Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
In fiscal 2018, there were no incidents in which Hitachi violated or was penalized under laws or regulations regarding bribery or corrupt practices and competition. Regarding tax compliance,
Hitachi acts in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations and did not have any significant fines or nonmonetary sanctions for noncompliance with tax laws and regulations.
Preventing Violations of Competition Law Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
As with our initiatives against bribery and corrupt practices, we are developing educational activities globally using e-learning material available in 12 languages—including Japanese, English, and. 
Chinese—while at the same time ensuring that we comply with the HGCP’s rules concerning competition law and other related business standards and guidelines.
In 2017, to enhance awareness of ethical principles and practices globally, we created a global version of our standards regarding contact with competitors based on the standards originally prepared for use in Japan.
Eliminating violations of competition laws is among our top priorities for regaining trust, and so Hitachi will continue its efforts to prevent the recurrence of any such incident. We have been providing a collection of case studies for workplace discussion to Group companies since 2012, and in 2018 we added case studies about competition law in three languages, Japanese,
English, and Chinese, to raise employee awareness.
Hitachi’s Tax Compliance Approach Policy. 
The global expansion of Hitachi’s business activities has made it necessary for the Group as a whole to build a system of tax governance in order to comply with indications made by the tax authorities in each country and respond to risks concerning taxation, such as tax-related legal proceedings. In January 2016, we established a set of tax-related regulations with which the entire Group must comply, and in April 2017 we set rules for Group transfer pricing management.
In connection with the globalization of our business, we are implementing risk management for taxation that focuses in particular on the points listed below: (1) Group companies strictly comply with all relevant laws and implement tax management when pursuing their business activities, bearing in mind such international tax-compliance standards as the Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations of the.

Risk Management. 
Hitachi launched an Investment Strategy Committee in 2017 to ascertain and minimize risks and to strengthen the quantitative risk management of its investments. The Executive Sustainability Committee deliberates the social and environmental impact of our business activities to clarify any negative impact our business has on society and the environment and to identify countermeasures. We are reinforcing business continuity plans (BCPs) and further tightening our information security to ensure the stable supply of our products and services and to prevent threats to our networks that could severely disrupt business operations.
Hitachi’s Approach Addressing Risks and Opportunities. 
Risks and Opportunities Policy. 
Hitachi’s 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, beginning in fiscal 2019, focuses on expanding our business while making the best use of the Company’s competitive advantages. In particular, we target investment for growth in select, focused areas over the three years through fiscal 2021 of ¥2.0–¥2.5 trillion, compared to investment of about ¥500 billion in the three years through fiscal 2018. We believe taking advantage of growth business opportunities and implementing aggressive management requires a solid risk management system.
Hitachi established the Investment Strategy Committee to strengthen investment risk management in 2017 and continues to work to better understand risk and take appropriate action. The Company in the same year established the Executive Sustainability Committee to focus on the company’s policies in regard to social and environmental issues. Our efforts in this area also included a move to identify issues that could be seen as business opportunities, as well as the negative effects on society and the environment from our business activities and the mea- sures Hitachi is taking to address them.
Risk Management System Frameworks and Systems. 
The business environment is changing day by day, impacted by the continued advance of information and communications technology, as exemplified by IoT, and geopolitical risks arising from complex shifts in political and economic conditions around the world. Hitachi aims to create new revenue opportunities while controlling risk. To do this, we maintain a clear understanding and analysis of the operating environment, taking into account social issues as well as our competitive advantages and management resources, and conduct risk management with an eye toward the many risks the Company should be prepared for as well as opportunities for growth.

Understanding and Responding to Quantitative Risk Frameworks and Systems. 
In regard to quantitative risk, assumed maximum risk (value at risk) is calculated using statistical methods based on the type of asset held. More specifically, value at risk measures the maximum expected loss based on price movements over a specified period of time (observation period) at a given confidence level for a defined period of time moving forward. Visualizing the strength of a company’s balance sheet and whether that company has the potential for growth, including by focusing on whether the maximum expected loss is within the range of net assets or whether there is room to invest in growth, limits the likelihood that opportunities for growth will be missed, while continued monitoring ensures that risks do not exceed management capabilities.
Moreover, analyzing risk by country and sector, while also taking into account future trends, allows a quantitative understanding of the concentration of risks in a given country or sector relative to profitability.

Social and environmental issues, including climate change, resource depletion, the curtailment of business activity due to significant disasters, and social instability due to growing inequality, are having a substantial impact on corporate value creation and business models.
Amid such a drastic change in the business environment, companies must have a clear understanding of opportunities and risks and take appropriate measures if they are to achieve sustainable growth over the long term.
Hitachi is able to gain a clear understanding of sustainability-related risks, and accordingly take appropriate action, thanks to the efforts of the Executive Sustainability Committee and other related committees. We remain actively engaged in promoting our own sustainable growth while contributing to the realization of a sustainable society by seeking out business opportunities con- tributing to the resolution of important domestic and overseas issues, including those relevant to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Society 5.0.

Stable Provision of Products and Services. 
Hitachi’s Thinking on BCPs Policy. 
Given the close relation of our business to social infrastructure, we are enhancing our business continuity plans (BCPs) to ensure that the impact of risks does not disrupt our business and thereby significantly affect society. In December 2006, we issued the Hitachi Group Guidelines for. 
Developing Business Continuity Plans (Overview) in Japanese. In fiscal 2010 this was translated into English and Chinese for distribution to all Hitachi Group companies worldwide to ensure our response readiness for large disasters and other risks.
Creating BCPs in Key Operations Worldwide Frameworks and Systems. 
When the Great East Japan Earthquake struck in March 2011, quick responses and swift decision making were enabled by the BCPs that we had developed based on the Hitachi Group. 
Guidelines for Developing Business Continuity Plans (Overview). However, issues emerged, including identification of secondary and other suppliers, cloud storage and multiplexing of production information, and the need to secure alternate transportation and fuel sources.
Based on the lessons learned from this disaster, in October 2011 we released and distributed new versions of the Hitachi Group Guidelines for Developing Business Continuity Plans (By Department) to further improve our BCPs.
By the end of fiscal 2011, Hitachi Group operations in Japan had completed their preparation and review of BCPs for both large earthquakes and novel strains of influenza as appropriate to their operations.
On top of these efforts, Hitachi, Ltd. has held annual earth-quake drills simulating a major seismic event at key operations in Japan since fiscal 1998. In March 2018, we held initial response drills at our headquarters under the direction of our head of Major Earthquake. 
Countermeasures Office simulating a large earthquake in the suburbs of Tokyo, striving to promote understanding of each department’s role and strengthen cooperation among departments. As part of countermeasures against large earthquakes striking the suburbs of Tokyo, in December 2017 we developed action plans including setting up substitute headquarters in the Kansai region in case our Tokyo headquarters cease to function temporarily due to such earthquakes. In March 2019, based on the scenario of an earthquake striking the Tokyo metropolitan area and significantly damaging its infrastructure, we established a substitute headquarters at our Kansai Area. 
Operation and conducted initial response drills and joint drills with the response headquarters at our Tokyo headquarters according to our action plans.
Hitachi appointed personnel with responsibility for risk-response policies at its main overseas bases in fiscal 2013. By the end of that year, around 300 companies prepared BCPs with the goal of completing them for key operations. These BCPs are aimed at strengthening our ability to respond to business risks, including large disasters, novel strains of influenza, political instability, and social disruption, as well as acts of terrorism. Moving forward, we intend to further expand the scope of our BCPs.
Hitachi’s Approach to Procurement BCPs Policy. 
We have a deep involvement in social infrastructures in places where the suppliers who are our business partners can be affected by major earthquakes and other natural disasters.
These disasters can heavily impact not only our business operations and those of our suppliers but also society as a whole. To minimize this impact, the procurement divisions in business units and key Group companies in Japan have created procurement BCPs that (1) standardize and use generic parts to make procurement as flexible as possible; (2) cultivate multiple suppliers;

Creation of Procurement BCPs Frameworks and Systems. 
To see whether or not procurement BCPs would be effective, we held desktop exercises to discuss in a group what should be done during and after a disaster, making further improvements as a result.
In fiscal 2018, all major Group business sites with production lines (approximately 210 sites in total) took steps to maintain and strengthen the procurement BCPs they had created by the previous fiscal year, thereby contributing to the continuation of Hitachi’s global operations.
Improving Safety for Employees Sent to Dangerous Regions Frameworks and Systems. 
Responding to the hostage incident in Algeria in January 2013, then President Hiroaki Nakanishi reinforced his policy in February 2013 of ensuring the safety of employees sent to countries and areas at higher risk. Survey missions of in-house and outside experts are now sent beforehand to areas at high risk of war, terrorism, and other threats. Even after employees are dispatched to such areas, we conduct additional local surveys every six months as a means of confirming the effectiveness of our safety policies. In fiscal 2018, against the threat of terrorism expanding around the world and infectious diseases spreading regionally, we had in place a range of safety measures, including providing timely alerts to employees. This underscores our commitment to ensuring the safety of our employees working around the globe. Hitachi is also contributing to safety measures at other Japanese corporations operating outside Japan. To help enhance collaboration between the private and public sectors in this area, Hitachi executives participated in the Council for. 
Public-Private Cooperation for Overseas Safety organized by Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Since 2014 Hitachi has taken part in public-private kidnap incident preparatory training exercises.
Information Security. 
Information Security Policies Policy. 
The increased connections between things due to development of IoT are creating new value.
At the same time, increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks are widening their focus from traditional. 
IT to include the IoT/OT field. Managing information security risks is one of the most critical issues for companies to minimize the risk of business disruption due to factors such as leaks of information or operational stoppages.
The development of the Social Innovation Business has highlighted for Hitachi the vital importance of information security governance as a key management issue. The Japan Business. 
Federation’s Declaration of Cyber Security Management that was published in March 2018 also placed emphasis on cyber security measures as a critical management challenge from the aspects of both value creation and risk management. Hitachi approaches the issue of information security governance based on the same concept.
At the same time, as a global company, we regard cyber security risk as one of our management risks. Accordingly, to allow us to declare both internally and externally Group policies for addressing this risk, we have formulated Information Security Policies in line with our corporate management policies and based on our cyber security risk management.
Information Security Policies 1. Formulation and continuous improvement to information security management regulations 2. Protection and continuous management of information assets 3. Strict observance of laws and standards 4. Education and training 5. Incident prevention and management 6. Assurance of fair business practices within the corporate group 151.

Three Principles for Preventing Leakage of Confidential Information Policy. 
Hitachi, Ltd. has formulated the Three Principles for Preventing Leakage of Confidential Information to ensure the highest level of care for such information and to prevent leaks and other related incidents. Our policies specify that if an incident does occur, damage must be promptly minimized by contacting customers, reporting to government agencies, investigating causes, and acting to prevent any recurrence.
Three Principles for Preventing Leakage of Confidential Information. 
Principle 1: In principle, no confidential information shall be taken outside of the company’s premises.
Principle 2: Any person taking confidential information out of the company’s premises when necessary for conducting business shall obtain prior approval from the Information Asset Manager.
Principle 3: Any person taking confidential information out of the company’s premises when necessary for conducting business shall carry out the necessary and appropriate measures to prevent information leakage.
Framework for Promoting Information Security Frameworks and Systems. 
At Hitachi, Ltd. the senior executive with ultimate authority and responsibility regarding the handling of information security and personal privacy issues is appointed by the president and. 
CEO. Hitachi established a position of chief information security officer (CISO) to oversee promotion of information security for all Hitachi products and internal facilities. In fiscal 2018, the CISO role was performed by an executive vice president.
Chaired by the CISO, the Information Security Committee determines all policies and procedures for information security and personal information protection. These decisions are conveyed to all Hitachi Group business sites and companies, and are implemented by the relevant information security officers.
Framework for Promoting Information Security. 
Information Security Management Frameworks and Systems. 
Hitachi Group companies worldwide reinforce their information security in line with our Global. 
Information Security Administration Rules, which conform to the international ISO/IEC 27001 standard. These rules are globally distributed from the parent company in Japan to Group companies worldwide. Other measures include the provision of shared security services and related support for information security by the regional headquarters in the Americas, Europe,
Southeast Asia, China, and India.

Security Monitoring. 
In Hitachi, the Security Operation Center (SOC) monitors security on a 24/7 basis so cyberattacks can be detected and countermeasures initiated right away. The Incident Response Team (IRT) collects and develops threat intelligence*1 and manages the response to any security incidents.
*1 Threat intelligence: An approach to countering cyber attacks using knowledge of new threats gathered from a range of information on cyber security.
Implementing Rigorous Information Security Frameworks and Systems. 
The Information Security Committee determines policies and procedures for information security and personal information protection. The Information Security Promotion Council and other bodies convey decisions internally and to other companies in the Hitachi Group. Information security officers at business sites and companies ensure that these decisions are implemented in the workplace.
The Hitachi Group emphasizes two points in information security and personal information protection: (1) Precautionary measures and prompt security responses. 
We clarify the principal systems and assets to be secured, using vulnerability and risk analyses to formulate companywide business continuity plans (BCPs) for cyber incidents and to implement safeguarding measures.
We also have an emergency process manual for security breaches, based on the assumption that these are inevitable, and not just possible.
(2) Promoting stronger ethical and security awareness among data users. 
We have prepared a program tailored to Hitachi’s various personnel levels and are working to raise the prevailing sense of ethics and security awareness through Group-wide e-learning. We are also conducting audits to identify and address problems early on.
Details, including a message from the CISO and a list of third-party assessments and certifications, are contained in Information Security Report 2018.

Preventing Information Leaks Frameworks and Systems. 
Hitachi takes the following IT steps to prevent information leaks: encrypting devices; using thin clients;*1 employing electronic document access control and expiration processing software; maintaining ID management and access control by building an authentication infrastructure; and filtering e-mail and visited websites. In response to the recent spate of targeted e-mail attacks and other cyberattacks, we are participating in an initiative to share information between the private sector and the government. We are also enhancing our IT organization by adding more layers to our leak prevention procedures.
To ensure the secure exchange of information with our suppliers, we review their information security measures based on Hitachi’s own standards before allowing them access to confidential information. We have provided tools to suppliers (procurement partners) for security education and for checking business information on computers. In addition, we require suppliers to check and remove business information from personal computers to prevent leaks.
*1 Thin client: A terminal with the minimum necessary software. Thin client computing significantly enhances cyber security by storing applications and data on the server.
Education on Information Security Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
Consistently maintaining information security requires all employees to continually develop their knowledge of information handling and to remain strongly aware of the issues. For this reason, we hold annual e-learning programs on information security and personal information protection for all directors, employees, and temporary employees.
Nearly all of the roughly 40,000 employees at Hitachi, Ltd. participate in these programs. We offer a variety of courses that have different goals and are tailored to different target audiences, including new employees, new managers, and information system administrators. In 2012, we also began simulation training to educate employees about malicious targeted e-mail attacks and other cyberattacks. Employees are sent examples of targeted e-mail to heighten their awareness of security through direct experience.
Our educational programs, available to Hitachi Group companies in Japan and other global regions, provide Group-wide education on information security and personal information protection.
Thorough Information Security Audits and Inspections Objectives, Activities, and Achievements. 
The Hitachi Group has developed its approach to security based on the “plan-do-check-act” (PDCA) cycle for its information security management system. We conduct annual information security and personal information protection audits at all Group companies and business units.
The president of Hitachi, Ltd. appoints officers to conduct independent audits. These officers are not allowed to audit their own units, underlining our commitment to fairness and objectivity in auditing. There are 220 Hitachi Group companies in Japan, including Hitachi, Ltd., that conduct audits in the same way as Hitachi, Ltd., and all results are subject to confirmation. For Hitachi. 
Group companies outside Japan, we use a “common global self-check” approach to ensure. 
Group-wide auditing and inspections. We implement Confirmation of Personal Information. 
Protection and Information Security Management annually for the voluntary inspection of Hitachi,
Ltd. business unit workplaces. We conduct monthly Confirmation of Personal Information. 
Protection and Information Security Management assessments at 606 operations (as of March 2019) that handle important personal information. This regular control mechanism ensures ample safety management and implementation.
