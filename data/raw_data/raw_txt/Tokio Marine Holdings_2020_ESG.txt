In August 2019, Tokio Marine Group celebrated the 140th anniversary of its founding. Since our founding in 1879, we have set customer trust as the starting point of all our activities and have supported customers and society in times of need and continuously helped them meet challenges that take a new step forward. This is both our role and mission. By building up the trust of customers across the world, we have achieved steady growth and this spirit continues to be handed down today throughout the Group.
Recent years have witnessed frequent occurrences of major natural disasters, and Tokio Marine Group is working as one to provide support in these disaster- stricken regions, beginning with our on-site customer response. Moreover, amid breathtaking changes unlike those seen in the past such as shifting demographics and the dramatic advance of technologies, companies are being asked to contribute even more to the creation of a sustainable society. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are attracting attention and there are expectations that companies together with governments and municipalities, non-profit organizations (NPOs) and citizens will contribute to the attainment of the SDGs. Our important role as a company is to cherish the bonds of trust we have built to the present with customers and society while meeting the expectations of a continuously evolving society. Tokio Marine Group will discover new opportunities within these changing times.
Tokio Marine Group believes corporate social responsibility (CSR) is synonymous with the implementation of our Corporate Philosophy and that promoting efforts to solve societal issues will lead to the Group’s sustainable growth. Under our Mid-Term Business Plan “To Be a Good Company 2020,” we have set “Providing Safety and Security,” “Protecting the Earth” and “Supporting People” as our core CSR themes and are working to solve social issues through the participation of all employees globally. Our ever more self-motivated employees will act with integrity and compassion, and as this spreads throughout organizations and the entire Group, we believe that it will create a virtuous cycle of developing innovative products and services along with contributing to local communities and society as we work toward the creation of a sustainable future and to contribute to the attainment of the SDGs. By implementing these initiatives, we aim to become a “Good Company” that is trusted by all people and society.
Toward a Safe, Secure and Sustainable Future.

It is necessary to develop appropriate risk management solutions and build safe and secure communities to mitigate damages from natural disasters and other causes and to respond to rising geopolitical risks. To ensure it can properly support customers and society even amid these changes, Tokio Marine Group provides safety and security throughout all its business activities. This includes carrying out industry-academia collaborative research, offering a variety of products and services, participating in international initiatives, continuously supporting reconstruction of disaster-stricken regions in collaboration with partners and conducting on-site Disaster Prevention Lessons for school children.
Industry-Academia Collaborative Research Responding to climate change and natural disasters is a high-priority issue for Tokio Marine Group from the perspective of enterprise risk management. Accordingly, Tokio Marine & Nichido has been promoting research on climate change and natural disaster risk through industry-academia collaborative research in cooperation with The University of Tokyo (since 2005), Nagoya University (since 2007), Tohoku University (since 2011) and Kyoto University (since 2012). In undertaking this research, Tokio Marine & Nichido strives to ascertain details of forecasts for damage caused by any natural disasters that could possibly occur in the future in order to share the outcomes of this research with society and promote disaster prevention awareness and education.
Going forward, we will continue and enhance industry-academia collaborative research and strive to utilize our research outcomes for sophisticating hazard maps in local communities and for other uses to raise safety and security in regional communities.
Creating Value through Products and Services Tokio Marine Group strives to quickly provide security to customers and communities through insurance and various services when disasters or accidents occur. Tokio Marine Group has begun distributing to customers personalized videos with customized information on necessary insurance in preparation for disasters. Tokio Marine Group provides its corporate customers with expert advice to expedite business resumption and assist corporate customers in designing optimal business continuity plans (BCP). Tokio Marine & Nichido also offers the products that provide safety and security to people who had not necessarily been insured. These products include One Day Auto Insurance, which is aimed at reducing auto accidents involving uninsured drivers by encouraging young drivers who do not own vehicles to sign up for insurance. Tokio Marine & Nichido is moving ahead in offering products and services that meet changes in customer needs and social issues. These include Drive Agent Personal, which ensures smooth responses when an accident occurs by using Tokio Marine & Nichido’s original driving recorder, as well as “Cyber Risk Insurance,” which responds to a variety of security needs.
Participation in International Initiatives To raise the resilience of society as a whole to natural disasters and contribute to problem-solving in time of disaster and mitigating damages, Tokio Marine Group participates in the United Nations.

Earthquake Reconstruction Support and Disaster Prevention Awareness and Education Tokio Marine & Nichido is continuing to provide support to the Tohoku Region affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake through a variety of activities that include support of the Ten-Year Restoration Project of the Coastal Forests of Tohoku Region, volunteer reconstruction support activities by employees and agents in affected areas and offering lunch menus from disaster-stricken regions at employee cafeterias with charitable donations. These support efforts are driven by our determination to “never forget the event at any cost and continue to do whatever we can do even in any small way.” Additionally, to ensure future generations are prepared for the next disasters and can protect themselves, Tokio Marine & Nichido also actively holds Disaster Prevention Lessons conducted by employees who visit schools as volunteer instructors targeting mainly elementary school children.
There are hopes that initiatives will be implemented such as for solving environmental and energy problems, preserving biodiversity, ecosystems and wetlands and creating a sustainable recyclingoriented society. Tokio Marine Group undertakes environmental protection activities in Japan and overseas through its products and services together with its customers and NGOs. Additionally, Tokio Marine Group has implemented the ISO 14001 environmental management system and our unique Green Assist environmental management system to continually work to reduce the environmental footprint in our business activities. Tokio Marine Group will continue to promote a variety of initiatives for protecting the earth.
Creating Value through Products and Services Tokio Marine & Nichido initiated the Green Gift Project*1 in 2009 based on the concept of “implementing environmental protection activities together with customers,” and this project has been the driving force for mangrove planting. In October 2013, the scope of this project was expanded to include natural conservation activities throughout Japan. In this manner, we are supporting environmental protection activities in Japan and abroad as a member of society together with residents in each community. In October 2016, we changed the name of these environmental activities in Japan to the Green Gift Planet GENKI Program. In doing so, we aim to carry out activities that are close to our customers and local communities and make further efforts to promote environmental protection. The Group’s initiatives for protecting the earth’s environment through our main businesses also extend across various nations. As one example, in 2015 U.S.-based Philadelphia Insurance Companies (PHLY) newly commenced the “PHLY 80K Trees” tree-planting program, which contributes to disaster prevention and mitigation in areas with frequent forest fires, inspired by Tokio Marine & Nichido’s Green Gift Project.
Promoting Environmental Management—Reducing CO2 Emissions and Becoming Carbon Neutral Tokio Marine Group promotes such initiatives as conserving electricity and energy, raising business efficiency by using tablet devices and promoting paperless operations. At the same time, the entire Group (consolidated basis) achieved carbon neutral status*2 in fiscal 2011 as well as in the six consecutive years from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2018 by offsetting the CO2 emissions generated by its business activities with CO2 absorption and fixation through means such as the Mangrove Planting. 
Project and acquisition of Tradable Green Certificates. In the future as well, Tokio Marine Group will continue efforts to reduce CO2 emissions and to realize carbon neutral status.
Our Passion Embodied in Mangrove Planting This year the Mangrove Planting Project marked its 21st year following its launch in 1999 together with an NGO involved in tree planting. It has now become a project that symbolizes the Group’s CSR with the participation of Group employees in domestic and overseas volunteer tree-planting tours. As of the end of March 2019, a total of 10,930 hectares of mangrove forest have been planted, which in fiscal 2018 absorbed and fixed 150,000 tons of CO2, having generated total economic value exceeding 118.5 billion yen and brought positive effects to the mangrove forests and the approximately 1.41 million people living in the surrounding regions. Mangroves play a diverse range of roles. These include mitigating the advance of global warming by absorbing and fixing CO2, preserving biodiversity and serving as a habitat and cradle of life for shellfish, shrimps, crabs and fish, and also functioning as green levees that protect communities from tsunamis and storms. Mangroves also provide fishery, forestry resources and other resources indispensable to the lives of residents in local communities and contribute to stabilizing and improving standards of living. Tokio Marine Group aims to continue the Mangrove Planting Project, which serves as “insurance for the future of the earth,” for 100 years.
Environmental Awareness and Education Tokio Marine Group promotes an array of environmental awareness and education activities that include Green Lessons that teach elementary school children about global environmental protection while enjoying mangrove-related themes. We also hold the Children’s Environmental Award program that solicits essays and paintings from children across Japan and recognizes the winners. Other activities include holding the Marunouchi Citizens Environmental Forum, a social and environmental awareness seminar.
The insurance business has been called a “people’s business.” For those of us who handle the intangible product of insurance, our employees and the trust built between people are everything. Valuing and continually supporting people are essential for Tokio Marine Group to earn the trust of all people and society, achieve sustainable growth and continuously create value for society. Therefore, Tokio Marine Group will make efforts to support a diverse range of people with initiatives that include creating value through products and services, promoting awareness and education for children who are responsible for the future of the earth and creating a symbiotic society by supporting the elderly, persons with disabilities and athletes.
Creating Value through Products and Services Tokio Marine Group is taking the knowledge in health management cultivated through its businesses and applying this at companies as insurance solutions and providing products to customers that support healthy and secure lives. Examples of such products include products related to “Life Insurance Revolution to Protect One’s Living” that respond to needs associated with longer lifespans accompanying the declining birth rate and aging population and Aruku Hoken that uses wearable devices with the concept of preemptively protecting customers from illness. In India, we provide weather insurance and microinsurance targeting farmers and low-income earners who suffer from poverty.

For Children, Who Will Lead the Future of the Earth Tokio Marine Group undertakes a variety of initiatives for children, who will lead the future of the earth. For example, Tokio Marine & Nichido is promoting youth development through a variety of programs. These include developing junior swimmers through support of the Japan Swimming Federation; helping young people grow, encouraging international cultural exchange and promoting sports in the local community through the Tokio Marine Kagami Memorial Foundation, Tokio Marine & Nichido Educational Development Fund and the Tokio Marine Sports Foundation; and providing support for the education of girls in low-income communities in India and Bangladesh via the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Room to Read. Through Group Work on Managing Risks and Opportunities, a career education program for junior high school and high school students, Tokio Marine & Nichido is also providing them with Group Work on Managing Risks and Opportunities led by employees who are dispatched to schools and are accepting these students for company visits. In the future as well, Tokio Marine Group will promote initiatives for children, who will lead the future.
Support for the Elderly, Persons with Disabilities and Athletes by Creating a Symbiotic Society Tokio Marine Group supports the creation of a society where the elderly can live with a sense of security and where persons with disabilities can overcome their disabilities to play active roles. Examples of this support include conducting courses for employees to foster dementia care supporters, providing support for the Special Olympics through volunteers from Group companies in Japan and overseas, and supporting the Japan Deafblind Association. Additionally, since 2016 Tokio Marine Group has been supporting the Japanese Para-Sports Association and the Japan Inclusive Football Federation. Through initiatives in which employees “learn about,” “watch” and “experience” sports for persons with disabilities, we aim to promote the further spread and development of sports for persons with disabilities and thus help create a symbiotic society.
Tokio Marine Group supports and respects the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, ILO Core Labour Standards, UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, as well as ISO 26000. Tokio Marine Group endorsed the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) in 2005 and has promoted initiatives based on the UNGC’s ten principles in the areas of human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption. We also place great importance on the social role and responsibilities that the insurance industry is expected to fulfill, while Tokio Marine & Nichido is a signatory to the Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI) advocated by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and is undertaking initiatives to create a sustainable society through its insurance business. Additionally, Tokio Marine Asset Management and Tokio Marine & Nichido are signatories to PSI supported by the UN, and are also contributing to creating a sustainable society through investments.
Tokio Marine Group will continue responding to environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues as well as continue to be a company that serves a useful purpose during times of need. Accordingly, we have defined our Diversity Policy as the creation of an environment that enables employees, who are working to solve social issues worldwide, to play active roles regardless of their nationality, gender, age or whether they have disabilities to further raise corporate value and realize sustainable growth. We will implement the Diversity Policy to promote diversity across the entire Tokio Marine Group. Although only at the midpoint, a variety of our initiatives have already been recognized. For example, Tokio Marine Holdings was selected by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Tokyo. 
Stock Exchange as a Nadeshiko Brand for fiscal 2018.
Based on the concept that “health and productivity management is the starting point for creating a “Good Company,” Tokio Marine Group formulated the Tokio Marine Group Wellness Charter and is creating mechanisms that enable customers and employees to live healthily both physically and mentally. These efforts were widely recognized and Tokio Marine Holdings was selected as a “2019 Health & Productivity Stock” (fourth consecutive year since 2016) by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
With the aim of fostering a corporate culture in which each and every employee strives to solve social issues as his/her own issue and ensure this helps raise corporate value and create social value, the “Tokio Marine Group CEO Recognition for CSR” was established in 2015 and commends and announces outstanding CSR initiatives by Group companies and their employees in Japan and overseas. By promoting CSR with the participation of all employees, in fiscal 2018 the employee participation rate (total) in community social contribution activities for Tokio Marine Group (domestic) was 135%. We therefore achieved the fiscal 2018 annual target of 100%.
Tokio Marine Group also enhances CSR/ESG information disclosure, which includes the publication of its Integrated Annual Report mainly targeting investors in August 2019 as it communicates its initiatives for the Group’s sustainable value creation. I hope that the Tokio Marine Group Sustainability Booklet 2019 “Together into the Future,” which explains the Group’s CSR story in an easy-tounderstand manner, along with the 2019 Sustainability Report, which provides a detailed explanation of CSR strategies together with data, are helpful in enhancing your understanding of Tokio Marine Group’s initiatives toward ESG.
Tokio Marine Group is a global insurance group with a dedicated, energetic and proactive workforce and organization, which is the wellspring of its competitiveness in each country and region and a crucial asset for contributing to the development of a sustainable society. My mission is none other than to make Tokio Marine Group a “Good Company” that works to resolve issues facing society and earns the widespread trust of its customers and society. This can only be achieved by harnessing the comprehensive power of the Group together with its employees in Japan and overseas and interacting and cooperating with its various stakeholders.

Strengthening CSR Management *1 Green Gift Project: This project offers customers an option to choose web-based insurance contracts (clauses) on our website rather than paper-based contracts in brochure form to reduce paper consumption. Tokio Marine & Nichido donates a portion of the amount saved through reduced paper use to support environmental protection activities in and outside Japan. *2 Carbon neutral means that CO2 emitted in the course of a company’s business activities is equivalent to the converted volume of CO2 reduced by the use of natural energy and the acquisition of emissions credits by such a company and absorbed and fixed by way of mangrove planting.

Tokio Marine Group’s self-motivated employees act with integrity and compassion, and as this spreads throughout organizations and the Group, we believe that it will create a vir tuous c ycle of developing innovative products and services along with contributing to local communities and society. Moreover, this cycle will lead to the sustainable growth of the Group. These efforts will serve as a bridge to our children and to future generations as we seek to transform risks into opportunities and create value for a safe, secure and sustainable future.
Tokio Marine Group has set the three core CSR Themes of “Providing Safety and Security,” “Protecting the Earth” and “Supporting People” under its Mid-Term Business Plan “To Be a Good Company 2020” (FY2018 – FY2020). Initiatives to address social issues are being promoted with the participation of all employees based on these core themes.
Accordingly, we have been implementing CSR ac tivities across a wide range extending from the provision of products and services to corporate citizenship activities. We will also communicate our principal CSR initiatives to society through this Sustainability Report while also promoting easily understandable measures to permeate these initiatives within the Group.
Tokio Marine Group's CSR Approach in Aiming To Be a “Good Company”
Addressing Social Issues Based on Three Core CSR Themes with the Participation of All Employees ◉ Core Theme 1：Providing Safety and Security ◉ Core Theme 2： Protecting the Earth ◉ Core Theme 3：Supporting People. 
The world is now facing various social issues, inflicted by frequent large-scale natural disasters, demographic shifts, income disparities and poverty. In Japan as well, issues are becoming prevalent also in relation with technological innovation as well as community resilience (disaster prevention and mitigation) and the country’s declining birth rate and aging population. These issues may induce drastic changes in risks surrounding the insurance business.
To protect customers and society from these risks, Tokio Marine Group has selected “Providing Safety and Security” as one of its three CSR core themes and is making efforts toward a safe, secure and sustainable future throughout its entire business operations.
The global issues of “climate change and natural disasters” and “depletion of biodiversity and wetlands” pose serious risks for the children not only of today but also of the future and at the same time have a significant impact on the business of Tokio Marine Group.
Having set “Protecting the Earth” as a core CSR theme, Tokio Marine Group works to provide products and services that are designed to mitigate or adapt to climate change and protect biodiversity, reduce environmental footprint in business activities, become carbon neutral, conduct environmental protection activities in Japan and overseas, and promote environmental awareness raising and education. Our aim is to contribute to preservation of the global environment and the creation of environmental value.
In Japan, the importance of responding to the nursing and health needs of the elderly is increasing due to the low birth rate and aging society. There is also growing demand to create societies in which people in underprivileged circumstances and those with disabilities can live with peace of mind in the community as economies and societies become more sophisticated and globalization progresses. In addition, there are calls for the acceptance, promotion and utilization of diversity in such areas as gender, age and nationality. On a global scale, the reality is that there is growing income disparity, increasing unemployment among youth, poverty and unequal opportunities for education based on gender.
Tokio Marine Group has set “Supporting People” as a core CSR theme in order to take up the challenge of resolving these issues. To this end, we will promote local community and social contribution activities supporting people through the growth of young people and support the elderly, persons with disabilities and athletes as well as contribute to the realization of a symbiotic society in which everyone can live with peace of mind by promoting diversity and inclusion.

8 ◉ Governance ~A Resilient, Highly Sound and Transparent Management Structure~ ◉ CSR Management. 
Tokio Marine Group is implementing initiatives throughout its entire business activities that are focused on its three core CSR themes. To earn the trust of all people and society and achieve sustainable growth, Tokio Marine Group must raise the quality of initiatives for “business strategies,” “governance” and “social responsibility” and build a structure for resilient, highly sound and transparent management as a global insurance group.
Accordingly, as initiatives serving as the basis of such a management structure, Tokio Marine Group is making efforts for compliance, fraud prevention, information security, privacy, respect for human rights, CSR in the value chain and sustainable investment.
Through these initiatives, Tokio Marine Group will meet the expectations of stakeholders, beginning with continuously enhancing shareholder value.
Tokio Marine Group is implementing initiatives throughout its entire business activities that are focused on its three core CSR themes and to earn the trust of all people and society and achieve sustainable growth it must strengthen CSR management with the aim of becoming a “Good Company.” Tokio Marine Group is promoting CSR management from the four perspectives of customers, the environment, health and human resources.
With the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in September 2015, there are rising expectations that companies will work toward realizing an even more sustainable and highly resilient world. In collaboration with stakeholders, Tokio Marine Group is leveraging its expertise and knowhow in insurance and risk management to contribute to the resolving of various societal issues that include the frequent occurrence of large-scale natural disasters, shifting demographics, the changing environment resulting from technological innovation and poverty.
Tokio Marine Group’s CSR Materiality (Material Issues) Tokio Marine Group identified CSR issues for each of the three core CSR themes and governance and specified their CSR materiality (material issues). We will promote initiatives by reflecting the identified CSR materiality in the Group’s CSR strategy and CSR targets.
Group Core CSR Themes and Materiality ~What Types of Issues Are We Addressing?~
Process for Identifying Tokio Marine Group’s CSR Materiality. 
Tokio Marine Group uses the following process to implement the “Disclosure 102-46: Defining report content and topic Boundaries” in “Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards.” 1. Identifying Related Issues The Group identified CSR issues that are subject to examination giving consideration to ways of contributing to CSR issues unique to the insurance and financial businesses and meeting the expectations of stakeholders in the future. In this examination, we analyzed the Group’s value chain and identified CSR issues in each core theme giving consideration to stakeholder interests and expectations brought up during stakeholder engagement.
Value Chain and CSR Issues >> Stakeholder Engagement >> CSR Library (Related Materials) Tokio Marine Group’s CSR Materiality >> 2. Prioritization of Issues Tokio Marine Group identified Group CSR initiatives by analyzing “Feedback from stakeholder engagement (CSR dialogue) with customers, shareholders, investors, employees, agents, business partners, local communities and societies,” “CSR issues and responses to a changing business environment surrounding the Group,” and “Relation to Tokio Marine Group’s corporate principle and management vision” from the dual perspectives of “significant impact on stakeholder evaluations and decision-making (impact on stakeholders)” and “significant impact of organizations on the economy, the environment and society (impact on business)” and then identified the priority of material CSR issues and CSR issues subject to disclosure.
Value Chain and CSR Issues >> Stakeholder Engagement >> CSR Issues and Responses to a Changing Business Environment Surrounding the Group >> 3. Confirming the Validity of Material Issues The comprehensiveness of CSR issues subject to examination, the relevance to core CSR themes, CSR Materiality (Material Issues) and the validity of CSR issues subject to disclosure are confirmed at CSR dialogues (meetings for dialogue and opinion exchanges between experts and Group management) and ultimately the approval of management is obtained.
Stakeholder Engagement (CSR Dialogue) >> 4. Review The CSR Board, which consists of presidents of major Group companies, periodically reviews the state of initiatives for CSR Materiality (Material Issues). Third-party assurance will be obtained from an independent external verification authority for core CSR themes and information will be disclosed in the Sustainability Report.
*Tokio Marine Group classified G4 “Material Aspects” into “CSR Materiality (Material Issues)” and “CSR Issues Subject to Disclosure.”

CSR Issues and Responses to a Changing Business Environment Surrounding the Group. 
We expect the insurance business environment to change significantly over the medium to long term due to a number of factors including the unprecedented pace of technological development, more frequent natural catastrophes, demographic shifts in the Japanese market and an increase in global oversight and regulation.
By proactively grasping these changes in the environment, we plan to refine our business strategy and advance our business platform that supports the creation of corporate value. Furthermore, by offering solutions to issues faced by stakeholders arising from changes in the business environment, we will provide safety and security to our stakeholders while striving to raise the competitiveness of the Group.
From such a perspective, we analyzed and prepared responses to CSR issues and changes in the business environment surrounding the Group to deepen discussion of ways to resolve issues faced by stakeholders arising from changes in the business environment from the perspective of CSR matters.
With these prepared responses serving as a starting point, we will further sophisticate our CSR activities.

Tokio Marine Group’s CSR Promotion Structure and Plans and Results of CSR Initiatives. 
Tokio Marine Holdings has established a dedicated CSR Division (CSR Division, Strategy and Synergy. 
Department) to identify material CSR issues and to formulate and implement Group CSR strategies. The division supports the CSR activities of each Group company through dialogue and cooperation with. 
CSR key persons appointed to promote CSR within the divisions in charge of CSR at the respective. 
Group companies.
Tokio Marine Group regularly convenes the CSR Board, comprising the president of Tokio Marine. 
Holdings (board chairman) and presidents of major domestic Group companies, as well as the. 
CSR Key Persons Conference, which consists of Tokio Marine Holdings and Group companies’ CSR divisions. These bodies evaluate various types of CSR initiatives and discuss response measures for. 
CSR issues (important issues to be shared by each Group company) for the entire Group. Tokio Marine. 
Holdings also convenes CSR Dialogues with external experts, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and non-profit organizations (NPOs). The dialogues give us opportunities to hear outside opinions about our awareness and approaches concerning the Group’s CSR issues. These opinions and other ideas are then reflected in our CSR strategy and our approach to each individual CSR issue.
The Company’s Board of Directors receives reports on the CSR activities of the entire Group while formulating the Overall Group CSR Strategy (medium-term plan and single fiscal-year plans). CSR promotion officers at each Group company play a leading role in promoting and handling common issues to be addressed by the entire Group as well as in implementing CSR activities based on the characteristics of each business and local communities.
■ Enhancing CSR Communication. 
Tokio Marine Holdings and Tokio Marine & Nichido hold CSR Communication Meetings for exchanging opinions targeting employees of domestic and overseas Group companies and Tokio. 
Marine & Nichido. These meetings seek to spread and deepen employees’ understanding of CSR and firmly implement CSR initiatives continuously and reflect the Group’s CSR policies in the measures and initiatives of Group companies and the branch offices of Tokio Marine & Nichido. These meetings enable the sharing of information and the straightforward exchange of opinions on CSR initiatives conducted in Tokio Marine Group, its respective companies and workplaces. Through these meetings, we have received comments from participants such as “Understanding the significance and purpose of CSR activities and ‘CSR through our core businesses’ has led to increased motivation.”
From fiscal 2015, we commenced the CSR Key Persons (CSRKP) Seminar for CSRKPs at Group companies and branch offices of Tokio Marine & Nichido. The seminar aims to share information and exchange opinions on the most current CSR trends as well as CSR strategy across the Group for the purpose of creating social value and raising corporate value. In July 2018, we invited Kazuo Tase, CEO of SDG Partners, Inc., to give a lecture on the current status and prospects of the SDGs, which was followed by a group discussion to facilitate better understanding and internalization of CSR and SDG concepts. On the same day, Masae Komiya, a goalball Gold medalist of the London 2012 Paralympic. 
Games, was also invited to give a lecture under the theme of “Teamwork That Brings Out Maximum. 
Potentials” to deepen understanding of the importance of CSR and SDG initiatives.
To help resolve societal issues and perpetually raise the Group’s corporate value, we will continuously hold these meetings and seminars in the future and ensure these improve the CSR mindsets and skill levels of employees.
■ CSR Training. 
Tokio Marine & Nichido conducts CSR training through e-Learning for all employees once a year to promote understanding and sharing of the philosophy behind the company’s CSR activities.
In addition to affirmation of the CSR Charter, the training includes topics such as confirmation of environmental burden reduction targets and the environmental management system and confirmation of the company’s community and social contribution initiatives. Key persons in each workplace promote participation in the training.

Tokio Marine Group has set the three core CSR themes of “Providing Safety and Security,” “Protecting the Earth” and “Supporting People” and is implementing different local community and social contribution activities around the world that emphasize voluntary participation by employees and tie-ups and collaboration with NPOs and other groups.
In addition to aiming to conduct ongoing local community and social contribution activities at each workplace and Group company, we have designated October and November as CSR Months every year with the aim of promoting employee-driven CSR activities. Many employees take part in a variety of local community and social contribution programs during this period in different parts of the world.
■ Support Systems and Donations. 
All Tokio Marine Group companies encourage the proactive participation of their employees in local community and social contribution activities by introducing them to activities in which they may be able to participate or by creating a volunteer leave system or an award program to recognize employees’ active efforts in local community and social contribution activities.

Stakeholder Engagement ～Promoting Initiatives Together with Various Stakeholders. 
In implementing high-quality corporate management, we believe it is essential to develop a relationship of mutual trust through dialogue with customers and all other stakeholders. We are promoting a deeper understanding of Tokio Marine Group’s thinking, values and various types of initiatives based on customer opinions (customer compliments, complaints and other opinions and suggestions) received by Group companies, and through engagement with shareholders and investors, communications with agents, communications with employees, communications with external Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) rating agencies and Socially Responsible. 
Investment (SRI) and CSR communication with external experts (CSR Dialogue). Using the obtained feedback, we identify issues of the entire Group and at each Group company. We also provide shareholder and investor information and issue various types of news releases through the media and make our best efforts to provide appropriately timed and adequate information disclosure to all stakeholders.

In the name of “CSR Dialogue,” Tokio Marine Group regularly invites outside experts to share the latest knowledge on CSR with management and to engage in dialogue (exchange views and engage in discussions) about Tokio Marine Group’s CSR initiatives. On December 19, 2018, we invited prominent figures and asked their opinions about the CSR initiatives of Tokio Marine Group in line with the latest social situation in the field of CSR. Several opinions offered by these experts are provided herein.
■ 1. Management Focused on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
An insurance company is a business operator having contact with people and companies in all business categories through its insurance business, involving a large number of stakeholders and having a significant impact on society through product development. I hope you will incorporate the globally pursued SDGs into your management strategies, promote the permeation of these goals within the Group and take the lead in efforts to increase their recognition worldwide.
［Tokio Marine Group’s response policies］
For Tokio Marine Group, the resolution of social issues is the very goal of our business, and we have been working to resolve natural disaster and other social issues even before the SDGs were adopted.
In fiscal 2019, we will step up our efforts by explicitly integrating the SDGs into the Group CSR strategies. Working with our stakeholders, we will continue to endeavor for the resolution of social issues through all our business activities from a long-term perspective.
■ 2. Value Creation Story. 
We are in an age in which the quality of conveying a company’s value creation story is crucial in ensuring good investor relations (IR) and public relations (PR). I think you would be able to better express your philosophy “To Be a Good Company” if you can clearly define the link between the SDGs and your strength-based business model and business model-based value creation story.
［Tokio Marine Group’s response policies］
Since fiscal 2018, Tokio Marine Group has been referring to the Guidance for Integrated Corporate. 
Disclosure and Company-Investor Dialogues for Collaborative Value Creation advocated by Japan’s. 
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in preparing its Integrated Annual Reports. In the 2019. 
Integrated Annual Report, we incorporated the SDGs into our value creation model and showed our initiatives toward the attainment of the SDGs in a table in the Environmental, Social and Governance. 
Initiatives and Contributions to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals section. We will continue to improve the quality of conveying our value creation story.
■ 3.Promoting the Permeation of the SDGs throughout the Group. 
I believe efforts to promote the permeation of the SDGs throughout the Group should be made in a way that factors in the individual positions and roles at the management level and at the actual operation level. For sales personnel, for example, it is essential to organize the SDGs-related initiatives into easily comprehensible, familiar themes from their perspective. Providing relevant education regarding them is also important.

Responding to Opinions in the CSR Dialogue Thank you for your valuable opinions. We will utilize these opinions in our future activities to accelerate our initiatives for resolving various issues facing society.
We aim to be a “Good Company” that supports customers and society in all times of need. Based on dialogue and collaboration with our stakeholders in all areas of our business, from products and services to respect for human rights and dignity, protection of the global environment, contribution to local communities and societies, governance and stakeholder engagement, all employees will work together to create a secure, safe and sustainable future with a focus on our three core CSR themes.

Global CSR initiatives. 
Besides playing a role in Japan, as a representative of Asia, Tokio Marine Group should fulfill the role of an industry leader in CSR throughout the rest of the world as well.
Tokio Marine & Nichido is actively participating in global initiatives, which include serving as a Board Member for UNEP FI-PSI (United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative Principles for Sustainable Insurance) for Asia.
Innovative initiatives. 
I’d like to see the implementation of environment-conscious initiatives that go beyond mere reductions of CO2 emissions and paper consumption (e.g., the total use of FSCcertified paper, investments in renewable energy).
•Tokio Marine & Nichido makes standard use of “environment-conscious paper” that includes FSC-certified paper. •Marketing of TM Nippon Solar Energy Fund by Tokio Marine Asset Management. 
November 24, 2011. 
Responses to climate change/global warming. 
I’m looking forward to seeing Tokio Marine Group play its role in providing awareness education and information that utilizes knowledge and experience that is unique to an insurance company.
Following our Green Lessons environmental awareness promotion program launched in fiscal 2005, from fiscal 2012 we have been actively developing Disaster Prevention Lessons as disaster-prevention education that is even closer to the main business of an insurance company.
Community and social contribution activities. 
I’d like to see community and social contribution activities carried out with further cooperation with NGOs and NPOs in Japan.
The Green Gift Project, an initiative started in fiscal 2009, initially supported mangrove planning activities overseas. In October 2013, we expanded the scope of this initiative to environmental protection activities in Japan as well and we hold events in collaboration with NGOs and other bodies in various regions throughout the country.
December 6, 2012. 
Community and social contribution activities. 
I hope to see support that enables employees (individuals) to independently participate in community and social contribution activities that transcend the bounds of business.
We continually think of creative ways for enabling employees to independently participate in community and social contribution activities through initiatives such as the following. •Creation of “List of Recommended Initiatives” that compiles tips for planning community and social contribution activities at each workplace •Participation in initiatives undertaken by the NGOs and NPOs that we support •Plan volunteer tours to support disaster regions and hold in-house solicitations of tour participants. 
December 16, 2013. 
Community and social contribution activities. 
Solving social issues is requiring even more expertise. I’d like to see activities carried out with an awareness of collaborating with local governments, universities, specialist institutions, NPOs and residents. Also, I’d like to see the development of the next generation of people who will work to protect the environment in regional communities.
We are carrying out industry-academia collaborative risk research with universities and strengthening collaboration with local governments and NPOs in domestic environmental protection activities while working to solve various social issues. We are undertaking environmental awareness and education activities through the implementation of Green Lessons for elementary school children and carrying out environmental protection activities in the Green Gift Project.
CSR management. 
I suggest setting “development of people” as materiality and ascertain needs in each region while promoting financial and environmental education and advancing these with initiatives used in your main business.
We set “Supporting People” as one core CSR theme in the new mid-term business plan (FY 2015–2017) and are implementing CSR. From fiscal 2012 we have been holding Disaster Prevention Lessons to raise the disaster prevention awareness of elementary school children. We will reflect regional characteristics and the outcomes of industryacademia collaborative risk research to the present into this program while also focusing on further improving this program. We have also started the development of a financial education program based on the theme of insurance as our main business.
Tokio Marine Group’s response policies. 
We will promote the permeation of the SDGs throughout the Group by using CSR Dialogues and the. 
CSR Board at the management level. At the actual operation level, we will do so by providing training for CSR Key Persons (CSRKP), CSR education and SDGs-related tools. For the latter, the CSR Division and other relevant departments jointly support the development of tools to raise awareness of SDGs.
From fiscal 2019, we also changed the name of our annual CSR Booklet to the Sustainability Booklet to clearly show the link between the Group’s initiatives and the SDGs. We will use the booklet in promoting the permeation of the SDGs throughout the Group and communicating with customers with regard to the SDGs.

Taking on the challenge of meeting global social issues. 
I’m hoping to see Tokio Marine Group utilize its knowledge and experience and actively participate in United Nations partnerships and international conferences for disaster prevention and mitigation as well as play an active role in the creation of an international framework as a Japanese company and an industry opinion leader.
Tokio Marine Group participates in the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) — Private Sector Alliance for Disaster Resilient Societies (ARISE) and the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI). At the Third United Nations World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction held in Sendai in March 2015, we disseminated information about such industry-academia collaborative research results as a stochastic risk assessment method for earthquake-induced tsunamis as well as the Group’s disaster-related solutions and promoted discussions for deploying the roles fulfilled by the insurance industry toward solving disaster issues and reducing damage. A Group member is presently participating in the creation of a framework for global climate-related financial disclosures as a member of the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB’s) Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD).
January 30, 2015. 
Visualization of the social impact of CSR. 
Amid expectations for strategic CSR by companies, it is essential to incorporate a perspective that looks at what types of impact Tokio Marine Group’s activities are having on social issues. I’d like to see this done, for example, through the “visualization” and disclosure of the impact of mangrove planting on local communities.
We commissioned an external think tank to investigate the social impact of mangrove planting that we have carried out since 1999. Calculations show that as of the end of March 2014, mangrove planting has generated economic value of around 35 billion yen and brought positive effects to the mangrove forests and the approximately 1.25 million people living in the surrounding regions. We introduce the Mangrove Planting Project in our news releases as well as in a Special Feature article in the CSR Booklet 2016.
Take on the challenge of turning risks into “opportunities”
I would like to see Tokio Marine Group, as a professional in risk management, turn future risks of the global community into “opportunities.”
We will seize changes in risk accompanying the frequent occurrence of natural disasters and shifting demographics as business opportunities that lead to growth. We will also further advance our CSR initiatives that bring major changes to risk and will focus efforts on our three core CSR themes of “Providing Safety and Security,” “Protecting the Earth” and “Supporting People.” By doing so, we will contribute to the creation of a secure, safe and sustainable future.
CSR materiality and CSR approach •Isn’t “Information Security” also an important issue as a core CSR theme? •How about rearranging core CSR themes into five steps as a CSR approach? •We reflected these opinions in Tokio Marine Group’s CSR materiality (important issues) and core CSR themes set in accordance with the new mid-term business plan “To Be a Good Company 2017.” This included setting “Information Security” as an element of internal control within CSR materiality (important issues). •We established a “CSR approach” that rearranged core CSR themes into five steps to ensure that the actions of each employee lead to value generation in the future.
February 17, 2016. 
CSR initiatives through our main business. 
I’d like to see Tokio Marine, as a trailblazing company in CSR, express the direction it intends to advance its CSR activities that are connected to the 2030 global SDGs.
In our Sustainability Report 2016, we established the item “Relationship between Group Initiatives and SDGs” and expressed the direction of efforts for CSR activities that are connected to the SDGs.
Disseminating information to society. 
I felt that the communication and design were inadequate. I look forward to seeing Tokio Marine Group disseminate information with a greater awareness of the visualization and visibility of its CSR activities.
We created and published “CSR Booklet 2016” keeping in mind communication and design. This booklet won the “Easy-to-Understand Award” in the UCDA Award 2016. Besides obtaining UCDA Easy-to-Understand certification, we disseminated information in “CSR Booklet 2017” by utilizing infographics.

Toward “To be a Good Company”
Companies are public institutions within society that contribute to society through their businesses. In doing so, three key factors enable companies to carry out vigorous business operations. The first is to contribute to all company stakeholders that include employees, customers, suppliers, local communities and the earth. The second is to continuously contribute to all stakeholders over the medium and long term rather than pursuing short-term results. The third is to take on challenges assuming maximum tolerable risk.
The idea that “companies are public institutions within society that contribute to society through their businesses” corresponds with Tokio Marine Group’s thinking that “CSR is synonymous with the implementation of its Corporate Philosophy and that promoting efforts to solve societal issues will lead to the Group’s sustainable growth.” Tokio Marine Group will make unceasing efforts to be a “company indispensable throughout society” and that is chosen by customers by getting close to our customers and local communities and making efforts to support this challenge.

CSR Initiatives through Our Main Business ~ Providing Value to Stakeholders. 
To sustain operations over the long term, companies should arrange and rebuild their own mission and initiatives from the perspectives of principal stakeholders to provide appropriate value and ensure the allocation of returns to each respective stakeholder.
Tokio Marine Group believes CSR is synonymous with the implementation of its Corporate Philosophy and regards CSR as an issue for raising the trust of customers and local communities and for generating social value. In the future as well, we will focus on dialogue, collaboration and cooperation with stakeholders that include customers, business partners and members of the local community. We will also promote CSR activities with the participation of every employee through all our business activities, from the provision of products and services to donations and volunteer activities. Additionally, we will make efforts toward value creation together with our stakeholders.

Permeating CSR within the Group companies. 
The most important point in permeating CSR within a company is the understanding and strong message from top management. The next task is to build a scheme that skillfully involves employees.
Tokio Marine Group believes that CSR represents the implementation of its Corporate Philosophy and promotes CSR activities with the participation of every employee through all business activities. For example, with top management actively leading the way, Tokio Marine Group participates in initiatives for “learning about,” “watching” and “taking part in” sports for persons with disabilities and widely disseminates information about these initiatives and their value across society through its CSR Booklet.
ESG investment becomes mainstream. 
I am hoping to see Tokio Marine Group make efforts to further enhance and promote ESG investment initiatives and ESG information disclosure.
Three Tokio Marine Group companies, namely Tokio Marine Asset Management, Tokio Marine Capital and Tokio Marine & Nichido, are signatories to The Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI) of the UNEP FI and are working to promote ESG investment as asset managers and as asset owners and will step up these efforts in the future.
December 19, 2018. 
Contributing to the Attainment of SDGs through Business Activities. 
SDGs require the efforts of the private sector based on the idea of benefits for five sides that include sellers, buyers, society, our future and the earth. One of the main facets of the SDGs is “No one left behind,” which values inclusiveness and diversity. One representative group that tends to get left behind is youth, who are the bearers of our future. The earth is something borrowed from our children. Therefore, I ask for everyone’s cooperation in promoting the SDGs to ensure the earth continues to be sustainably handed down as something beautiful to the next generation.
Tokio Marine Group has set “Supporting People” as one core CSR theme and actively promotes education and awareness activities for children, who are responsible for our future. For example, Tokio Marine Group holds a variety of programs with the participation of all employees that include Disaster Prevention Lessons to prepare for the next major disaster and Green Lessons based on the theme of mangroves (both for elementary school children) as well as Group Work on Managing Risks and Opportunities (for junior high school and high school students), a career education program that provides an awareness of insurance through a management game. In the future as well, Tokio Marine Group will promote education and awareness activities for children.
Responding to the Protection Gap. 
Urbanization and slumification are progressing throughout the world. During the next 10 years, 95% of the world’s urbanization will occur in developing countries while the population of persons living under vulnerable circumstances will also increase. These persons are especially vulnerable to disasters. Natural disasters are increasing in scale due in part to the impact of climate change. Protecting these vulnerable persons is thus also one reason for companies to promote the SDGs.
In 2001, Tokio Marine Group established IFFCO-TOKIO General Insurance Co., Ltd. (IFFCO-TOKIO), a non-life insurance company, as a joint venture with Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Limited (IFFCO), which has a nationwide network of 38,000 member cooperatives, and started offering auto, fire and other insurance in India. At the same time, Tokio Marine Group sought to resolve the lifestyle of uncertainty faced by farmers in India through insurance and is developing and providing weather insurance and microinsurance (low-cost insurance) as well as accident insurance as an incidental to fertilizer and grain and medical insurance with subsidies from the local state governments in India’s rural communities. In the future, Tokio Marine Group will continue contributing to the development of regional communities and solving poverty issues by providing products and services for socially vulnerable persons in India and other regions.
December 19, 2018. 
PrinciplesBased Regulatory Compliance and Sustainable Corporate Value Creation. 
The dramatically accelerating speed of technological progress and innovation has made it increasingly difficult for regulatory and supervisory authorities to assume every situation and establish rules beforehand. Regulatory authorities thus have no choice but to just issue major policies such as corporate governance codes. Against this backdrop, respective corporate governance reforms are being undertaken, such as those implemented globally to “prevent a recurrence of the so-called Lehman Brothers shock,” as well as those in Japan to “raise earnings power.” All of these aim toward the direction of “sustainable corporate value creation.” In Tokio Marine Group as well, I look forward to seeing the establishment of principlesbased management strategies and policies and the promotion of management that sustainably raises corporate value.
Tokio Marine Group believes CSR is synonymous with the implementation of its Corporate Philosophy and strives to strengthen its management foundation throughout all its business activities. Regarding corporate governance, Tokio Marine Group has endorsed the Corporate Governance Code and aims to build a sustainable management structure based on the principles of the Code. For example, under the Corporate Governance Code, publicly listed companies should appoint at least two independent outside directors. However, the Company proceeded early on to strengthen corporate governance functions such as by appointing three or more outside directors since the establishment of the current company in 2002. Going forward, Tokio Marine Group will work to raise corporate value in a sustainable manner.
ESG Investment Becomes Mainstream. 
As expressed in “Guidance for Integrated Corporate Disclosure and CompanyInvestor Dialogues for Collaborative Value Creation” (Guidance for Collaborative Value Creation) announced by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) in 2017, companies must demonstrate to investors that solving issues related to ESG through business activities is the source of corporate value creation. Rather than talking about only individual elements of ESG, companies are being asked to comprehensively identify these as elements of medium-to-long-term risks and opportunities and consider how these elements are being incorporated into corporate growth strategies, what type of influence these have on the sustainability of business models and how these are being addressed strategically.
Tokio Marine Group regards ESG issues that are strongly connected to the insurance business, such as “climate change and natural disasters,” “demographic changes” and “technology innovation,” as CSR materiality. Tokio Marine Group is working to create a society resilient to natural disasters, promote health management and support the building of an ultra-smart society through all its business activities, from providing products and services to promoting donation and volunteer activities. In these areas as well, we will also comprehensively consider ESG issues as risk and opportunity elements and make efforts to solve social issues and raise corporate value. Moreover, through our Integrated Annual Report and Sustainability Report, we will strive to further enhance communication with investors and other stakeholders regarding our initiatives aimed at solving ESG issues.

To assure transparent and fair management, Tokio Marine Holdings works for timely and appropriate information disclosure, while implementing a variety of measures to realize fair and constructive dialogue with domestic and overseas shareholders and investors.
For institutional investors, besides holding conference calls on financial results, we also hold IR briefings led by top managers, beginning with the Group CEO, following the interim and fiscal year- end financial results, and at these briefings these managers explain management strategies and the progress of these strategies and hold dialogues. We held an IR briefing on our overseas business, which had been much requested by investors, for the first time in fiscal 2018. The session was held in three major regions in the world, namely, London, New York and Tokyo, with the participation of top management of our major Group companies overseas. Additionally, we actively hold interviews with shareholders and investors in Japan and overseas and held a total of 410 interviews in fiscal 2018. For individual investors, we hold an annual IR conference led by the Group CEO, while the IR officer and others actively convene briefings in various cities throughout Japan.
The valuable opinions that the Company receives from shareholders and investors through these activities and the General Meeting of Shareholders are regularly reported to the Board of Directors, shared broadly as feedback to management and all Group employees and are used in improving management.
Tokio Marine Group actively disseminates IR information in Japanese and English on its website and posts a wide range of various types of information that assists in making investment decisions.
Tokio Marine Group promotes local community and social contribution activities in collaboration with NPOs committed to solving various issues in local communities. For the Mangrove Planting. 
Project, one of the most notable initiatives undertaken by the Group, we have formed a long-term partnership with the NGO Action for Mangrove Reforestation (ACTMANG) specialized in mangrove planting, Organization for Industrial, Spiritual and Cultural Advancement-International (OISCA) and International Society for Mangrove Ecosystems (ISME). Besides planting mangroves, we also cooperate in improving environmental awareness and promoting industries in designated planting regions, such as providing environmental education and workshops for local residents and children.
In Japan, we collaborate with Nippon NPO Center, eight Environmental Partnership Offices located nationwide and environment-related NPOs throughout the country and carry out the Green Gift. 
Planet GENKI Program that encourages experience-based, environmental protection activities primarily targeting children.

The Asia-Pacific region faces high natural disaster risk and many areas are vulnerable to natural disasters. At the same time, the region is also accumulating assets along with economic growth.

Meanwhile, APFF participated in the APEC Workshop on Financial Management of Public Assets against Disaster Risks, which was held in June 2018 at the World Bank’s Tokyo office and convened practitioners from finance ministries in. 
APEC member economies. At this workshop, APFF demonstrated actual examples of how risk modeling techniques of insurance companies can be used effectively in disaster risk management for public assets and emphasized the effectiveness of participation by private insurance companies in preparing for public asset disaster risk.
Tokio Marine & Nichido (Masaaki Nagamura, Special General Manager of Corporate Planning Dept.) is participating as a member of APFF and is leading discussions on DRFI within APFF.

To ensure financial soundness and appropriateness of business operations, Tokio Marine Group has identified the various risks surrounding it in an overall fashion and implements appropriate risk management corresponding to the nature, status and other attributes of the risks.
Tokio Marine Holdings Risk Management ■ Risk Management System. 
To ensure financial soundness and appropriateness of business operations, Tokio Marine Group has identified the various risks surrounding it in an overall fashion and implements appropriate risk management corresponding to the nature, status and other attributes of the risks.
The Company promotes the development and enhancement of the risk management system for the entire Group in accordance with the “Tokio Marine Group’s Basic Policies for Risk Management.” The. 
Company also manages quantitative risks for the Group in order to maintain credit ratings and to forestall insolvency in accordance with the “Tokio Marine Group’s Basic Policies for Integrated Risk. 
Management.”
Among the various risks, the Company recognizes that insurance underwriting risks and investment risks must be managed as sources of earnings. The Company therefore controls these risks considering the balance between risk and return. The Company also identifies administrative risks, system risks and other associated risks (such as cyber risk and risk of information leak) that arise from the Group’s business activities and strives to prevent the occurrence of or reduce these risks.
The Company presents its basic policies for risk management and provides instruction, guidance, monitoring, and other services to domestic and overseas Group companies through the Risk. 
Management Department and the Business Divisions. Group companies establish risk management policies in line with the policies of the Group and execute risk management independently. For cyber risk and risk of information leakage, the Company conducts tests relating to emergency response once a year and as a separate initiative teams up with other organizations to practice emergency response.
Through the above measures, the Company executes proper risk management and ensures stable business operations of the entire Group.
■ Basic Policy for Responding to Disasters (Tokio Marine & Nichido)
In the event of a natural disaster such as an earthquake or a typhoon, Tokio Marine & Nichido has a crucial social mission of ensuring that it can continue its important business operations as a non-life insurer such as receiving accident notices, paying on claims, maturity refunds and other payables, and concluding policies in both the disaster-stricken area and elsewhere.
Therefore, Tokio Marine & Nichido has prescribed the following two points as its Basic Policies of the. 
Business Continuity Plan for Disasters and formulated a Business Continuity Plan (BCP).

37. 
Basic Policies of the Business Continuity Plan for Disasters 1. Principles of employees’ conduct in times of disasters. 
The priority order for employees’ conduct in times of disasters is as follows.
•Assure the safety of human life • Cooperate in securing the safety of local communities • Continue important operations (business continuity)
In other words, the principle of employees’ conduct is to give precedence to “assure the safety of human life” and “cooperate in securing the safety of local communities” before conduct related to “business continuity.” 2. Basic policy for business continuity. 
The following three business operations shall be regarded as important business operations during a disaster, management resources (personnel, funds) shall be transferred as needed and top priority shall be given to the continuation of these important business operations.
• Receiving of accident notices • Payment of claims, maturity refunds and other payables • Conclusion of insurance contracts ■ Building a Structure for Paying Insurance Claims Benefits in the Event of a Disaster Striking the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. 
At Tokio Marine & Nichido, should the Head Office facilities in particular become unusable because of a disaster such as a major earthquake striking the metropolitan area, earthquake claims cases for residential earthquake insurance shall be handled in the Kansai region. Additionally, backup offices shall be launched at multiple bases throughout Japan, including in the Kansai region, and claims payment service responses, excluding on-site assessments after receiving claims, shall be made by all branches throughout Japan.
If the metropolitan area is struck by a disaster, a Claims Service Headquarters would be set up within the Head Office Disaster Response Headquarters. At the same time, a satellite office centering on the. 
Claims Service Department in charge of Tokyo, Chiba, Saitama and Kanagawa prefectures shall be set up and will accept support personnel from throughout Japan and handle customer responses, mainly on-site claims assessments, in disaster-stricken areas.
The infrastructure needed to provide claims services swiftly to the metropolitan area in the event of a natural disaster has been built in advance in the locations where the above-mentioned backup offices and satellite offices would be established. In this way, a structure for claims payment services during times of emergency is being established.
Non-earthquake regular claims cases, including for automobile accidents, shall be allocated to and handled by claims service bases throughout Japan prescribed in advance.
■ ESG Integration into Insurance Underwriting Risk Management. 
Since July 1, 2017, Tokio Marine & Nichido has revised its “Insurance Product Development and. 
Revision Procedure” so as to include “CSV (Resolving social issues through business)” as one of the goals of product development and revision, and also provides environmental and social factors as checkpoints for reducing risks when developing and/or revising an insurance product.
Since April 1, 2018, Tokio Marine & Nichido has revised its “Insurance Underwriting Risk Management. 
Manual” so as to clearly include environmental and social factors as the checkpoints for insurance product development and revision.
■ ESG-related exclusions in Insurance Underwriting. 
Tokio Marine & Nichido has implemented ESG-related exclusions in its insurance underwriting.
Examples include the followings.
-Anti-social forces: Tokio Marine & Nichido shall, in accordance with its corporate philosophy and compliance declaration, make every effort to respond to all anti-social forces in an appropriate manner by positioning the severance of relationships with them and the refusal of unfair demands from them, etc. as fundamental matters in the practice of its corporate philosophy.
-Various sanctions and limitations: Under the circumstance that various sanctions and limitations aimed for the purposes of security, etc. have been resolved and enforced by governmental bodies,
Tokio Marine & Nichido may not provide coverage, pay insurance claims and provide other services (with respect to insurance claims, any claims related to these sanctions and limitations will be excluded from payment regardless of the terms of the insurance contract).

The Compliance Department of Tokio Marine Holdings supervises information security for the entire Group as the controlling department while sections in charge of information security have been established at each Group company. In this manner, the Group is working to build an effective management structure for information security.
Tokio Marine Group Basic Policies for Information Security Management ■ Initiatives for Information Security. 
We thoroughly adhere to information security management rules to prevent information leakages. In particular, each Group company is adopting physical and technological safety-control measures that include locking away customers’ personal information and confidential documents when not in use, placing restrictions on taking documents and other items outside the company, and using encryption and setting passwords for electronic information.
Tokio Marine & Nichido has installed thin-client* terminals for its in-house intranet. Thin-client terminals are not equipped with hard disks and information is centrally managed and deployed from a server, which thereby further strengthens information security.

Initiatives for Building a Low-Carbon Society. 
The Paris Agreement, adopted at the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP21) held in December 2015, clearly sets out the world’s common long-term goal of keeping a global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. A new international framework to promote measures against climate change, as well as other actions specified for achieving this goal, are expected to affect future social and economic activities and facilitate the transition to a low-carbon society.
Toward the 2 degrees Celsius goal of the Paris Agreement, Tokio Marine Group will voluntarily implement measures against climate change and focus on encouraging the transition to a low- carbon society through constructive dialogue and collaboration with a number of stakeholders, from international organizations, the Japanese government and business and academic communities to non-profit organizations (NPOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The Group believes that it is also important to promote climate change measures as one pillar of our efforts to build a sustainable society, specifically when working to resolve various social issues and achieve the United. 
Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) had been entrusted by the Financial. 
Stability Board (FSB) to formulate voluntary recommendations for consistent, comparable, reliable, clear and efficient climate-related disclosures by companies in the financial sector and released its final recommendations in June 2017.
Climate change and natural disasters represent a global issue and have a significant impact on. 
Tokio Marine Group as we engage in the insurance and financial services businesses. As such, Tokio. 
Marine Holdings is supporting the activities of the TCFD and is working toward the formulation of policy recommendations to encourage disclosure that will help investment decisions by engaging in discussions and exchanging opinions with relevant government and private-sector parties in. 
Japan and overseas. In July 2018, Tokio Marine & Nichido became a founding member of the insurer pilot group, launched by the United Nations Environment Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) under the. 
Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI) framework to examine and develop methodologies and analytical tools for the insurance industry to make climate-related disclosures based on the TCFD’s recommendations. In Japan, the Chairman of the Board of Tokio Marine Holdings worked as one of the founders and contributed to the establishment of the TCFD Consortium in May 2019. After the establishment, he has been a member of the Planning Committee to deliberate on the consortium’s. 
Climate-Related Financial Disclosure Based on the Recommendations of the TCFD future course of action. He also participates in discussion on effective ways for companies to disclose climate-related information and how to link the disclosed information to appropriate investment decision-making of financial and other organizations.
Tokio Marine Holdings made disclosure based on the TCFD’s recommendations for the first time in its. 
Integrated Annual Report 2017 issued two years ago.
The table below is an overview of the four fields of disclosure based on the TCFD’s recommendations.

40 ■ Physical Risk. 
Climate change due to global warming is considered to possibly bring about major changes in the frequency and scale of weather disasters in the future. As such, basing analyses only on past statistical data may prevent appropriate risk assessment and significantly impact the calculation of insurance premiums and the ability to pay insurance claims in the event of a serious disaster.
Occurrence of water immersion, power failure or other damage resulting from a flood or other natural disasters at any of the bases of Tokio Marine Group may disrupt the Group’s business operations and cause financial impact, including response costs and lower revenues. For this reason, the Tokio. 
Marine Research Institute and other Group companies have been assessing and calculating the impact on insurance losses under future climate conditions, using the Intergovernmental Panel on. 
Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. Specifically, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 are used to simulate changes in typhoon risk, while RCP8.5 is used to simulate changes in flood risk due to increased rainfall. The results of analyses of such scenarios are referenced in managing risks through the Group-wide Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) system while considering the potential impact on insurance underwriting from more severe natural disasters arising due to climate change. In addition, we strive to make a faster, smoother response to losses after a typhoon or other wide-area disasters by strengthening our support structure in Japan, introducing electronic means to report loss internally and within each agent and taking other measures to enhance the competitiveness of our claims services.
■ Transition Risk. 
In line with the transition to a low-carbon society, enforcement of more stringent laws and regulations and rapid technological advancement may trigger changes in the Group’s business environment and in customer needs, and possibly affect the way we do business and what products and services we develop and provide. However, we expect that replacement of the existing products and services with low-carbon options will occur gradually, allowing us to implement appropriate risk management and develop and provide adequate accident response services for insurance policies that have a relatively short term, including those renewed annually.
■ Opportunities. 
In the process of promoting GHG emissions reduction, a shift to “cleaner” modes of power generation may occur and further increase needs for insurance for clean energy providers, including solar, geothermal and wind power generation operators. Amid such a change, we have been conducting. 
Climate-Related Strategies. 
The Board of Directors of Tokio Marine Holdings is the decision-making body for Tokio Marine. 
Group’s climate-related action policies. It evaluates and determines the Overall Group CSR Strategy that encompasses climate-related measures, a medium-term plan and plans for each fiscal year. As regards the implementation status of climate-related measures throughout the Group, the Board also monitors matters having significance in terms of management based on the reports from a dedicated. 
CSR promotion department (CSR Division within the Strategy and Synergy Department of Tokio. 
Marine Holdings).
The CSR Board, comprising the CEO of Tokio Marine Holdings (Group CEO) and presidents of Group companies, is responsible for executing the climate-related strategies of the entire Group. The CSR. 
Board holds meetings periodically to evaluate and discuss the Overall Group CSR Strategy that includes climate-related measures, a medium-term plan and plans for each fiscal year, and based on the reports from the CSR Division, monitors the implementation status of climate-related measures throughout the Group.
The Group Chief Strategy and Synergy Officer (Group CSSO) is responsible for overseeing the Business. 
Strategy Department, in which the CSR Division has been established, as well as for handling CSR- and sustainability-related issues of the entire Group and making reports to the Group CEO. The Group. 
CSSO and the CSR Division meet periodically to discuss the ongoing projects. The Group CSSO also monitors climate-related matters based on the reports from the CSR Division, while the CSR Division investigates and provides findings on topics for which the Group CSSO has requested clarification.

41 and have been making various efforts as part of our climate-related strategies. These efforts include: engaging in industry-academia collaborative research on climate change and weather disaster risk, developing and providing disaster risk-related products and services, raising environmental and disaster prevention awareness, reducing the environmental footprint in business activities and achieving carbon neutral status.
Additionally, Tokio Marine Group has been participating in the United Nations Global Compact,
UNEP FI, UN-endorsed Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) and other initiatives to collaborate with various stakeholders and contribute to the creation of a safe, secure and sustainable future. In responding to climate change and natural disasters, the Group is also striving to share the findings of its industry-academia collaborative research with society as well as to resolve disaster issues and mitigate disaster damage on a global basis. These efforts are carried out by joining international initiatives, such as the Private Sector Alliance for Disaster Resilient Societies (ARISE) led by the UN. 
Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), The Geneva Association’s Climate Change and Emerging. 
Environmental Topics (CC+EET) working group and ClimateWise. With the aim of encouraging developing countries to financially prepare for increasingly severe weather disasters, we have been playing a leading role in creating an international framework for promoting disaster risk insurance through our engagement with the Insurance Development Forum (IDF) and Asia-Pacific Economic. 
Cooperation (APEC).

Offshore wind power generation that uses the force of offshore wind to generate power, in particular, has drawn much attention globally for its better generating efficiency than onshore wind and solar power generation. It is also considered a promising option in Japan as the country is surrounded by the sea and has long coastlines. In November 2018, the Diet passed the Act of Promoting Utilization of Sea Areas in Development of Power Generation Facilities Using Maritime Renewable Energy. 
Resources for promoting the offshore wind power industry, thereby setting up a system to license operators to use designated sea areas for a certain period of time. However, in addition to substantial facility installation costs, offshore wind power generation faces many risks that vary from those encountered on land and thus requires adequate risk management. Tokio Marine Group has already been underwriting insurance for offshore wind power generation projects around the world. At the same time, the Group has accumulated know-how for analysis and assessment of the risk of natural disasters specific to Asia, including typhoons, earthquakes and tsunamis. Driving Japan’s efforts in this area in terms of insurance, Tokio Marine Holdings has been sharing its know-how accumulated in past projects at international conferences and seminars and intends to play an important role in further promoting the use of offshore wind power generation.
There is also an expected rise in needs for stabilizing the lives of people in farming and other communities more vulnerable to climate change and weather disasters. As an example of our response, we have been selling Barish Bima Yojna / Mausam Bima Yojna in India, which is a weather insurance product that evaluates climate risks such as precipitation volume and temperature in all areas within the country and takes into account the impact of unseasonable climate on grain harvest yields in farming communities.
While using CO2 emissions from business activities and the CO2 fixation and reduction effect from mangrove planting, the purchase of green power and other activities as our metrics and setting out the target of achieving carbon neutral status, we are strengthening our ability to respond to the transition risk and creating additional opportunities for efficient use of resources and cost reduction.
Given these climate-related risks and opportunities surrounding Tokio Marine Group, we have specified climate change and natural disasters as issues having CSR materiality (material CSR issues)

We use CO2 emissions from business activities and the CO2 fixation and reduction effect from mangrove planting and other activities as our metrics. Our target is to achieve carbon neutral status on a Group basis annually, and we have attained this target for six consecutive years from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2018. We will continue toward achieving this target in fiscal 2019 and onward.

Metrics and Targets on insurance losses caused by a change in flood risk as a result of increased rainfall. Moreover, at the ERM Committee comprising top management of Group companies in and outside Japan, we identify material risks surrounding Tokio Marine Group and develop policies to respond to these risks.
Material risks identified in fiscal 2018 included major wind and water disasters in Japan and major natural disasters overseas. In identifying material risks, we have adopted a system to monitor all risks, including emerging risks resulting from environmental and other changes, and comprehensively assess these risks using both quantitative factors (such as economic loss and frequency of occurrence) and qualitative factors (including business continuity and reputation). We also perform stress tests using scenarios of low frequency but high consequence major natural disasters and other extreme events.
The level of reinsurance premiums may fluctuate widely in line with increasing large-scale weather disasters due to climate change, possibly causing a sharp rise in reinsurance premiums. Tokio Marine. 
Group strives to optimize retention and reinsurance on a Group basis. As for natural disaster risks, we designate Tokio Marine & Nichido as the Group Retention Vehicle. While a certain portion of all natural disaster risks assumed by Group companies in and outside Japan is centralized to Tokio. 
Marine & Nichido through intra-Group reinsurance, risks that exceed the retention level deemed appropriate on a Group basis are collectively ceded* to the external reinsurance market. By this collective ceding, we leverage economies of scale to reduce ceding costs.
Management Strategy Section, Integrated Annual Report 2019 *Ceding refers to an insurance company passing on a part of its responsibility to pay insurance claims to another insurance company.
At Tokio Marine Holdings, a dedicated CSR promotion department (CSR Division within the. 
Company’s Strategy and Synergy Department) identifies risks and opportunities, including those related to climate change, and compiles the assessment results of these risks and opportunities for drafting an Overall Group CSR Strategy. The division also holds a monthly meeting with the CSSO, who is a Vice President, to also discuss the assessment results.
Tokio Marine Group also identifies and assesses climate-related risks and opportunities by analyzing the feedback from stakeholder engagement. This stakeholder engagement initiative includes “CSR. 
Dialogue,” in which we regularly invite outside experts to share the latest knowledge on CSR with the. 
Group’s management and to engage in dialogue (exchange views and engage in discussions) about. 
Tokio Marine Group’s CSR initiatives.
Additionally, Tokio Marine Group performs management through our environmental management system, and engages in energy conservation and resource conservation activities. The head office of. 
Tokio Marine & Nichido has adopted an environmental management system based on ISO 14001 in fiscal 1999. At Group companies in Japan and overseas, we are introducing our unique environmental management system through collaboration with Tokio Marine Holdings and Tokio Marine & Nichido.
Each year, we identify and assess environmental issues, including climate-related risks, and define environmental targets.
Meanwhile, Tokio Marine Group engages in research through collaboration with The University of. 
Tokyo, Nagoya University, Kyoto University and other organizations to look into the impact of climate change on the insurance business over the short, medium and long terms and to identify and assess climate-related risks. As an example outcome, the Group has learned that under future climate conditions (about 100 years from now), an increase in the average typhoon intensity will increase typhoon risk.
Tokio Marine Group promotes Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) that seeks to increase corporate value by integrating risk-based decisions into all aspects of business and using capital adequacy and profitability relative to risk as metrics for making management decisions. Under the ERM framework, we conduct risk management while taking into consideration various factors, including the research results such as the said change in typhoon risk under future climate conditions as well as the impact.

We select excellent slogans and disseminate them through our in-house intranet, Group newsletters and posters to be put up in each workplace as an effort to instill and spread the awareness of respecting human rights.
Keeping the human rights perspective in daily business operations and thoroughly ensuring prevention of discriminatory practices. 
Tokio Marine & Nichido has in place a document inspection system to check for any expression (including illustrations) or wording undesirable from the perspective of human rights in its advertisements for customers as well as in its daily business operations.

46 ■Supporting Initiatives for Reducing Human Rights Risk in Building Supply Chains. 
In solving human rights problems such as forced labor and child labor that are spreading globally, rather than relying solely on initiatives by government institutions, there are increasing demands that global companies take responsibility and respond to these problems throughout their entire supply chains. There are also various instances in which inadequate handling of these issues causes a major decline in the brand value of global companies and leads to product boycotts. Accordingly, in fiscal 2017 Tokio Marine & Nichido formed a business alliance with Caux Round Table Japan (CRT Japan), a specified NPO, and commenced support for initiatives for reducing human rights risk, such as forced labor and child labor, which could occur within global companies’ supply chains that span the world.
Tokio Marine & Nichido introduces CRT Japan to companies working to promote “responsible supply chains.” These companies receive advice from CRT Japan and establish systems that aim to reduce human rights risk throughout their entire value chain. Tokio Marine & Nichido designs and provides custom-made insurance for companies that receive advice from CRT Japan. This insurance covers the additional costs of establishing crisis measures when hidden human rights risks are discovered at second- and third-tier manufacturing subcontractors overseas despite having already taken adequate measures for human rights risk when building supply chains. As a result, companies can use this insurance to cover various expenses needed for responding quickly and accurately to prevent the occurrence of a major reputational risk when a human rights issue arises in the supply chain. In the future as well, Tokio Marine Group will continue to support the building of supply chains of global companies.
■Hotline System (Whistle Blower System)
In order to solve human rights issues, such as sexual harassment and other various types of harassment, we have set up a Hotline System (Whistle Blower System), through which employees seek the advice of internal and external experts, and have been striving to realize a better workplace environment for employees.
■ Human Rights Due Diligence. 
Tokio Marine Group has established a system to ensure human rights due diligence based on the UN. 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
For Tokio Marine Group, human rights due diligence means an ongoing, preventive and voluntary process to avoid or reduce any negative impact of corporate activities on human rights and to become a “Good Company.”
According to the process, Tokio Marine Group conducted a human rights risk assessment in fiscal 2017 with the assistance of Verisk Maplecroft, the world’s leading global risk analytics and forecasting company, and the specified NPO Caux Round Table Japan (CRT Japan). The assessment covered every country in which we do business, and we identified potential human rights issues which we need to tackle in order to prevent risks from occurring.
In fiscal 2019, we will analyze and assess the possibility of occurrence of the identified risks and the impact of these risks on our stakeholders, and at the same time, will work to formulate necessary risk prevention measures.
■Respect for Human Rights in the Value Chain. 
Tokio Marine & Nichido issues the Principle of Transactions for business partners (suppliers and subcontractors) from the perspective of social responsibility. The Principle of Transactions requests that business partners promote initiatives that encompass human rights as well as “compliance with laws, regulations and social norms,” “promoting fair and honest transactions,” “thorough information management” and “consideration for the environment.”

Tokio Marine Group regards slave labor and human trafficking as social issues that must be solved and makes efforts to prevent slave labor and human trafficking in its own businesses and value chain (supply chain). At the same time, the Group is urging its various stakeholders to undertake initiatives toward solutions to these issues.
■UK Modern Slavery Act 2015. 
Modern Slavery refers to enslavement and servitude, all forms of forced labor and human trafficking, etc.
The International Labour Organization (ILO) reported in a 2014 survey that there were approximately 21 million victims of forced labor worldwide (as of 2012) while annual illicit profits reached US$150 billion (estimate), which shows that even in present times slave labor and human trafficking are serious social problems.
Accordingly, in March 2015 the British government enacted the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 (“Slavery. 
Act”) to prevent forced labor and other present-day slave labor as well as human trafficking. The. 
Slavery Act went into effect in October 2015. Section 54 of the Slavery Act requires commercial organizations that undertake business in the United Kingdom (regardless of whether the company is headquartered in the United Kingdom) and that have annual sales of £36 million or more to publish a statement of steps taken each fiscal year to prevent slave labor and human trafficking in their own businesses and value chain (supply chain).
■ Tokio Marine & Nichido Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement for the Fiscal Year 2018. 
Tokio Marine & Nichido announces as follows the Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement for the fiscal year 2018 as a response to the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015. Tokio Marine & Nichido, together with its employees and business partners, will implement initiatives to prevent slave labor and human trafficking.

Response to the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 ■Respect for Human Rights in Sustainable Investment and Financing. 
Giving consideration to environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues in investment and financing is becoming increasingly important from the perspective of improving long-term risk/ return. Tokio Marine & Nichido places great importance on the social role and responsibilities that the insurance industry is expected to fulfill, and in June 2012 signed as a drafting member the Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI) advocated by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance. 
Initiative (UNEP FI).
In April 2011, Tokio Marine Asset Management signed the United Nations-supported Principles for. 
Responsible Investment (PRI) initiative, accepting these principles as an asset management company.
As an insurance firm that has taken ESG issues into account in its insurance underwriting, investment analysis and other actions, Tokio Marine & Nichido signed the PRI in August 2012. Through PRI and PSI related activities, Tokio Marine Group is strengthening its initiatives for human rights in investment and financing.

■ Fulfilling Social Responsibilities Together with Business Partners. 
To implement ESG initiatives that are integrated into the value chain, Tokio Marine Holdings aims to have Tokio Marine Group and business partners fulfill their social responsibility and achieve sustainable development together. In working to realize this objective, Tokio Marine & Nichido formulated the Principle of Transactions, which outlines the items that should be followed in terms of conducting transactions, and is applying this across its Group. Tokio Marine & Nichido issues the Principle of Transactions to such Group business partners as suppliers and subcontractors and requests that these business partners promote initiatives for “compliance with laws, regulations and.

■ Principles for Responsible Institutional Investors (Japan’s Stewardship Code)
Based on the Japanese government’s growth strategy, the “Japan Revitalization Strategy” (Cabinet decision in June 2013), the Council of Experts established within the Financial Services Agency announced in February 2014 the “Principles for Responsible Institutional Investors (Japan’s. 
Stewardship Code) – To promote sustainable growth of companies through investment and dialogue.” “Stewardship Responsibility” means bearing responsibility for expanding medium- and long- term investment returns for “customers and beneficiaries” (including end beneficiaries) through constructive “purposeful dialogue” (engagement) by institutional investors based on a deep understanding of investee companies and their business environments to raise the corporate value of these companies and promote their sustainable growth.
As described above, this Code has been formulated to promote medium- and long-term growth of companies through “purposeful dialogue” (engagement) by institutional investors with their investee companies.
In May 2014, Tokio Marine Asset Management announced its adoption of the Principles for. 
Responsible Institutional Investors (Japan’s Stewardship Code). In June 2017, the company renewed its adoption of the Code based on a revision to the content of the Code in May 2017.
In May 2014, Tokio Marine & Nichido agreed with the intent of Japan’s Stewardship Code and also announced it would adopt the Code.
Tokio Marine Asset Management: Adherence to Japan's Stewardship Code. 
Tokio Marine & Nichido: Adoption of Japan’s Stewardship Code (in Japanese)
Reference: Japan’s Stewardship Code (excerpt)
Principle 3. Institutional investors should monitor investee companies so that they can appropriately fulfill their stewardship responsibilities with an orientation towards the sustainable growth of the companies.
Guidance 3-3. When investors monitor investee companies, a variety of factors, including nonfinancial ones, may be considered as relevant. Factors may include, for example, governance, strategy, performance, capital structure and risk management (including how the companies address risks arising from social and environmental matters) of the investee companies. … Institutional investors need to use their own judgment in choosing which factors to focus on in light of their stewardship responsibilities.
Based on the intent of the Principles for Responsible Institutional Investors (Japan’s Stewardship. 
Code), Tokio Marine Asset Management and Tokio Marine & Nichido have formulated clear policies on publicly announcing the exercise of voting rights and the results of the exercise of voting rights and are disclosing details of their stewardship activities that include the results of the exercise of voting rights.

Value Creation through Sustainable Investments. 
Tokio Marine Group contributes to the creation of a safe, secure and sustainable future together with its stakeholders by developing and providing ESG investment products.
■Provision of the Tokio Marine Japanese Equity Fund to Contribute to the Creation of a Low-Carbon Society Promoting initiatives toward realizing a low-carbon society is an urgent and important issue with the adoption of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement based on the goals set by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Accordingly, as an initiative for contributing to the attainment of these goals, Tokio Marine Asset Management provides the Tokio Marine Japanese Equity Fund to contribute to the creation of a low-carbon society. The fund is comprised of equities of Japanese companies actively working to reduce greenhouse gases. By offering a fund with an investment universe consisting of Japanese companies disclosing their greenhouse gas emissions, we will provide support on the financial side for efforts by Japanese companies to realize low-carbon operations.
Specifically, this fund has been established by building a Japanese equity portfolio with half the level of carbon intensity* relative to the TOPIX index. This will enable investors not only to achieve broad Japanese equity market performance but also to contribute to supporting a reduction of greenhouse gases and the creation of a low-carbon society.
As part of efforts of Tokio Marine Group, Tokio Marine & Nichido has invested in this fund with the aim of promoting, from a financial aspect, the initiatives of Japanese companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
■Provision of Premium World In December 2007, Tokio Marine Asset Management launched Premium World, an environmental investment trust fund that invests in Japanese and other companies involved in activities under the following themes. These themes are related to environmental or social issues arising from the growing economies and increasing population in the world, which need to be sustained or improved. •Environmental (e.g., global warming and clean energy) •Water and foodstuffs (e.g., stable supply of water and food and enhanced productivity) •Medical services and healthcare (e.g., medical techniques and promotion of better health)
For institutional investors, the company launched a socially responsible investment (SRI) fund targeting Japanese companies in January 2006. Leveraging the comprehensive risk management know-how of Tokio Marine Group, this fund aims to obtain long-term and stable added value based on the Group’s unique environmental, social, governance and risk management (ESGR) analysis and evaluation. In the future, Tokio Marine Asset Management intends to fulfill its social responsibilities as an institutional investor and improve investment performance over the long term while giving due consideration to ESG issues in its asset management operations.
■Providing a Renewable Energy Fund Since 2012, Tokio Marine Asset Management has been operating the TM Nippon Solar Energy Fund for institutional investors, including corporate pension funds, to invest in solar power plants as an investment product targeting Japan’s national infrastructure. The company has also been operating the TM Nippon Renewable Energy Fund that invests in various types of renewable energy, including wind power, biomass, hydropower and geothermal power in addition to solar power, since 2017.
These funds are investment products that diversify investments among Japan’s renewable energy generation businesses and provide investment income to investors from sales of electric power.
Japan initiated a feed-in tariff (FIT) system for reusable energy sources in July 2012 with a view to increasing the use of solar, wind and other reusable energy. The system requires all users of electricity, including businesses and households, to pay a surcharge on electricity generated from renewable sources. The TM Nippon Solar Energy Fund, which is based on this FIT system, is designed to return investment income to citizens of Japan through corporate pension funds, the major investor of the fund.
Tokio Marine Asset Management believes that this fund will contribute to the diversification of energy sources. By offering investment opportunities of social significance through this fund, the company strives to fulfill its social roles and responsibilities as an asset management company.
■Providing an Engagement-Focused Fund to Invest in Japanese Companies With the launch of Japan’s Stewardship Code in February 2014, the importance of engagement between institutional investors and companies is further increasing its significance from a viewpoint of responsible investment.
Taking an early start, Tokio Marine Asset Management (TMAM), jointly with GO Investment Partners (GO)*, launched the TMAM-GO Japan Engagement Fund in March 2012. This engagement-focused fund primarily invests in small- to medium-sized Japanese companies having strong core businesses. By promoting engagement with investee companies based on a full understanding of the corporate culture in Japan, the company intends to deepen mutual understanding between investors and Japanese companies and provide increased corporate value over the long term.
Tokio Marine Asset Management ■Establishing Japan’s First Fund to Invest in Microfinance-Related Assets We provide microfinance services mainly to low-income earners in emerging and developing countries.

We continued to engage in industry-academia collaborative research in order to respond to climate change and natural disaster risk.
We continued to offer Drive Agent Personal, a rider to our automobile insurance, which uses our original driving recorder to protect customers.
We promoted our work to make society resilient to natural disasters through participation in international initiatives and helped to facilitate disaster risk reduction across the world.
We continued to distribute “personalized” videos to provide customized information on disasters based on regional characteristics.
Core Theme 1: Providing Safety and Security. 
CSR & ESG Highlights security and undertaking local community and social contribution activities leading to safety and security.
Making Society Resilient to Natural Disasters. 
One mission of Tokio Marine Group is to provide, in response to natural disaster risk, products and services leading to the safety and security of customers and local communities. To achieve this mission, we are applying our knowledge, which we have accumulated through research on natural disaster risk and participation in international initiatives, to the development of insurance products and services and are promoting activities to disseminate our know-how on disaster prevention and mitigation widely throughout society. Even after a disaster, we focus on making swift claims payments and providing services for the early recovery of business operations.
Building a Secure Society by Leveraging Traffic Technology Innovation. 
Another mission of Tokio Marine Group is to deliver traffic safety and security through its non-life insurance products and services. Tokio Marine Group provides insurance products and services that quickly capture the latest innovation in traffic technology, and will contribute to increasing society’s preparedness against traffic risk and prevention of traffic accidents.
Building a Secure Society by Responding to Varying Lifestyles and Changes in Society. 
Tokio Marine Group provides services responding to the expanding inbound market for business operators in Japan as well as services to counter the growing corporate governance and cyber risks resulting from business globalization and technology innovation. We also distribute information on natural disasters via the Internet, smartphones and other means and are devising ways to smoothly receive loss reports upon an accident. Through these and other efforts, we are working to provide comprehensive coverage matched to the needs of our day-to-day life.
The world is now facing various social issues, inflicted by frequent large-scale natural disasters, demographic shifts, income disparities and poverty. In Japan as well, issues are becoming prevalent also in relation with technological innovation as well as community resilience (disaster prevention and mitigation) and the country’s declining birth rate and aging population. These issues may induce drastic changes in risks surrounding the insurance business. To protect people, including our customers, from these varying risks and also capture business opportunities while responding to these risks, Tokio Marine Group has selected “Providing Safety and Security” as one of our three CSR core themes. We are making efforts toward a safe, secure and sustainable future throughout our entire business activities from conducting research on natural disaster risk to providing products and services that are beneficial for safety and. 
CSR Materiality(Material Issues) • Products and services beneficial for safety and security • Climate change and natural disasters • Technological innovation • Low birth rates and aging societies, and population demographics • Local community and social contribution activities •Promoting ESG in the provision of products and services.

Risks and Opportunities Associated with Climate Change. 
Considerable concern exists over the possibility of increased typhoons, heavy rains, droughts and other natural disasters caused by climate change. The insurance business has a close relationship with weather disasters and therefore risks such as the following are possible.
• Growth in the number of insured contingencies and insurance claims payment amounts due to an increase in weather disaster risk • A sharp rise in reinsurance premiums due to increases in large-scale weather disasters • Worsening fund position due to an increase in insurance claims payment amounts resulting from weather disasters • Risk of discontinuation of business due to the impact of weather disasters on buildings, IT facilities and other facilities • Risk of impacts from weather disasters in countries and regions throughout the world along with growth in the overseas insurance business. 
In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which collects scientific research into climate change, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its contributions to raising recognition of climate change. Established in 1988, the IPCC presents the current state, causes, impact, adaptation measures and mitigation measures concerning climate change through means such as assessment reports. In its “Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change. 
Adaptation” issued in 2012, the IPCC supplemented previous research with an appeal to the importance of adaptation and disaster risk management with respect to climate change.
The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report announced from 2013 to 2014 provided, in addition to the topics discussed in past reports, a more detailed quantitative assessment of impacts on food and incomes and made an appeal to government decision-makers. The Working Group II Report states that besides river overflows and coastal region seawater immersion that causes flooding, the increases in the severity and frequency of extreme weather disasters are conspicuous risk factors at the global level. In view of this, the report cited insurance systems as one of the economic sectors affected by these risk factors.
Although weather phenomena are natural occurrences that are beyond our control, it is possible to prepare ourselves and adopt measures against the increasing risks of weather disasters. Tokio Marine. 
Group regards these evolving risks as opportunities and aims to promote risk-based management to maintain a sound financial base and to provide protection to customers and society by offering appropriate insurance products and risk management services. We are promoting the following specific measures as activities for creating opportunities.

Making Society Resilient to Natural Disasters. 
Resolving disaster issues and mitigating disaster damage are two major concerns in the international community and challenges we should tackle. Consequently, Tokio Marine Group engages in an array of initiatives in relation to disaster prevention, including three initiatives cited in the “Compilation of. 
Private Sector Example Initiatives for Building National Resilience,” a reference material published by the Cabinet Secretariat (May 2018 edition). These are: Earthquake and tsunami risk research, industry- academia collaboration between Tohoku University and Tokio Marine & Nichido; Disaster Prevention. 
Lessons to cultivate the ability to survive a disaster; and Contributing to disaster prevention and mitigation, utilizing the ecosystems in coastal areas.
We are applying our knowledge in the areas of natural disasters as well as disaster prevention and mitigation, which we have accumulated through research on natural disaster risk and participation in international initiatives, to the development and provision of products and services leading to the safety and security of customers and local communities well into the future. At the same time, we are promoting activities to disseminate our knowledge on disasters and disaster prevention and mitigation widely throughout society through such efforts as raising disaster prevention awareness of children as well as companies before a disaster strikes. Even after a disaster, we focus on making appropriate and swift claims payments and providing services for the early recovery of business operations of companies affected by the disaster. Tokio Marine Group seeks to contribute to building a safe and secure society that is strongly resilient to natural disasters by providing total responses before and after disasters through its diverse products and services and various initiatives, including activities to raise disaster prevention awareness, provide relief funds and engage employee volunteers.
Tokio Marine Group’s initiatives to promote disaster prevention contribute to achieving five of the. 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) specified in “Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for. 
Sustainable Development,” which was adopted at the United Nations Sustainable Development. 
Summit in September 2015. These five goals are: SDG 1 (No poverty), SDG 9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), SDG 13 (Climate action) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the goals). We will continue to promote our efforts to make society resilient to natural disasters by collaborating with various stakeholders.

3. Products and Services >>
Based on the lessons learned from earthquakes and other disasters in the past, and as a means to help people prepare for future disasters, Tokio Marine Group promotes the development and provision of products and services tailored to new risks.
❖ Section composition ■To Deliver Security at the Earliest Possible Opportunity. 
Remaining strong and caring to support customers and society in emergencies – This is an aspiration shared throughout all activities of Tokio Marine Group.
A strong earthquake that hit the northern part of Osaka in June 2018 inflicted considerable damage mainly in the Kansai region. Immediately following the earthquake, Tokio Marine & Nichido set up a head office disaster management task force and a local response headquarters, and to ensure the earliest possible claim payments, quickly established a claim service structure to handle many more claims than ordinary times by setting up a backup office that integrates initial response and various business administrative functions. Employees, appraisers and loss adjusters dispatched to the disaster areas visited customers affected by the disaster to check the status of damaged houses and buildings.
In addition to making swift response to customers who have reported losses, as just described, we believe that it is also a social mission of a non-life insurance company to proactively notify possible claim payments to customers who are likely to be entitled to such payments. We contacted customers who live in areas largely affected by the disaster but had not reported losses to express our sympathy and remind them of their enrollment in our earthquake insurance. We also sent out brochures that explain claim payment requirements and other relevant matters and notify contact points for customers to report any loss.
We also made a swift initial response to the torrential rains that occurred in western Japan in July 2018 by spreading the roles of recording losses and making initial contact with customers among non-affected bases.

■Initiative to Utilize Drones and AI in Making Insurance Claims Payments –Using AI to Analyze Images Taken by Drones to Accelerate Damage Investigation and Repair Costs Calculation–
Larger and more frequent natural disasters in recent years have caused considerable damage to both housing and properties of individual customers as well as plants and warehouses owned or operated by corporate customers. Following such a disaster, loss adjusters or appraisers of an insurance company perform on-site investigations to assess damage. The insurance company then calculates and closely examines the amount of claims based on their investigation results, photos of damaged sites, loss estimates and other materials before making claims payments. Checking damage on the roof of a plant or warehouse, in particular, poses risk to loss adjusters or appraisers, sometimes hindering detailed damage investigation. A large facility also requires a certain period of time to finish investigating all damaged areas.
For these reasons, Tokio Marine & Nichido has been examining ways to utilize technology such as drones in performing accurate and swift damage investigation and repair costs calculation before making claims payments to customers. In June 2019, Tokio Marine & Nichido partnered with. 
Airobotics Co., Ltd., a company excelling in drone-based aerial photography technology and image analysis using artificial intelligence (AI), and launched an initiative to accelerate the process from damage investigation to repair costs calculation by having AI analyze multiple images taken by drones. Specifically, aerial images of a plant or warehouse taken by Airobotics’ drones are patched together to create imagery data that clearly shows affected areas and their damage levels. AI analyzes the resulting data to automatically identify damage and quickly calculate loss amount. The accuracy can be improved by letting AI learn from a vast quantity of imagery data, collected with customers’ consent, and the results of image diagnoses by loss appraisers. This AI-driven automatic process allows Tokio Marine & Nichido to significantly increase the efficiency of its work, from when a customer provides loss estimates and other necessary documents until its loss appraisers prepare a report. It in turn ensures swift claims payments to affected customers by greatly reducing the time required to do so (usually about one month if done by loss appraisers).
In the event of a large-area disaster that often imposes considerable pressure on loss appraisers, the use of drones in damage investigation can increase its speed and the number of customers’ properties undergoing investigation. Currently, the process is mainly applied to damage sustained by plants and warehouses owned or operated by companies, but we will examine the possibility of extending its scope to damage on individual customers’ housing and properties.
Tokio Marine & Nichido will continue to provide claims services more closely aligned with customers.
At the same time, we will work to achieve even greater customer satisfaction by leveraging leading- edge technology.
■Early Disaster Recovery Support Service through a Tie-Up with BELFOR. 
Tokio Marine & Nichido has formed a partnership with BELFOR (Japan) Co., Ltd., a company possessing highly specialized technologies in the disaster recovery support field, and has been providing the Early Disaster Recovery Support Service for corporate customers. The company has added a new rider to essentially all of its fire insurance* for business operators to cover the expenses for emergency stabilization measures, allowing policyholders to use the Early Disaster Recovery. 
Support Service of BELFOR under specified conditions without incurring additional costs.
The availability of the Early Disaster Recovery Support Service jointly provided by Tokio Marine &
Nichido and BELFOR expanded from Japan to the United States, Europe and Southeast Asia. We now have a system to provide support for the early recovery of business operations to customers throughout the world.

Step 1) Verification of disaster and contamination. 
Upon being informed by a customer of the occurrence of a disaster or accident, we contact BELFOR after obtaining consent from the customer for dispatching a crew. BELFOR immediately visits the damaged site, conducts an on-site inspection and draws up a “contamination map” that identifies contaminated areas within the site.

Step 4) Full-scale restoration by BELFOR. 
During full-scale restoration operations, BELFOR conducts the restoration of buildings and equipment contaminated with smoke and soot due to fire or mud caused by flooding by using its special cleaning techniques, know-how and originally developed chemicals.
< Representative examples of BELFOR’s special techniques >
BELFOR uses its precision cleaning techniques to restore the condition and functions of contaminated equipment and facilities, for which replacement was the only option available in the past. This helps reduce the business interruption period significantly and is particularly effective in case of customized facilities that require a considerable amount of time to replace.

University, Tokio Marine Group engages in research on climate change and natural disaster risk in an effort to gain deeper scientific insight into disaster prevention and mitigation and to raise the sophistication of measuring methods through risk modelling to ascertain risk volume in even greater detail. Our efforts in this area include development of a stochastic risk assessment approach. We 2. Product and Service Planning and Research ■ Area Information Network in Time of Disaster. 
In August 2014, Tokio Marine & Nichido concluded an agreement concerning the establishment of an area information network in time of disaster with the 38 member FM radio stations of the Japan. 
FM Network Association (JFN). Under the agreement, Tokio Marine & Nichido and each of the JFN member FM radio stations exchange information via telephone lines in the event of an earthquake or any other disaster. Tokio Marine & Nichido will provide disaster-related information on affected areas, including damage status, as well as procedural guidance for filing insurance claims, while the radio stations transmit the information within these areas, across the corresponding prefecture and nationwide. Through this collaboration, we aim to ensure the security of local community members and help to support the recovery and reconstruction of affected areas.
believe that in addition to providing products and services in developed countries it is also important to disseminate the ideas of an insurance mechanism and risk management practices in developing countries and regions particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change and natural disasters in accordance with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, which provides new world guidelines for disaster risk reduction. To this end, we are working to resolve disaster issues and mitigate disaster damage globally by using the outcomes of our industry-academia research to the benefit of society and by taking part in international initiatives, such as the UNDRR Private Sector. 
Alliance for Disaster Resilient Societies (ARISE) and The Geneva Association’s Climate Change and.

■ Building a Society Capable of Reducing and Adapting to Risks Resulting from Climate Change and Natural Disasters. 
The 21st session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP21) held in December 2015 adopted the Paris Agreement as a new international framework of measures against climate change for 2020 onwards. As the world’s common long-term goal, the Paris Agreement aims to keep a global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The agreement also makes a clear link between itself and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, which was adopted at the Third United Nations World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction held in Sendai in March 2015. There is a concern for the growing natural disaster risk due to climate change, and. 
Tokio Marine Group, working to resolve disaster issues and mitigate disaster damage, also gives due attention to the goal of the Paris Agreement and intends to contribute to its achievement.
Climate change due to global warming and other factors is considered to possibly bring about major changes in the frequency and scale of weather disasters in the future. As such, basing analyses only on past statistical data may prevent appropriate risk assessment and significantly impact the calculation of insurance premiums and the ability to pay insurance claims in the event of a serious disaster.
In response, Tokio Marine Group conducts research on climate change and natural disaster risk and on earthquake and tsunami risk through industry-academia collaboration and presents the outcomes at conferences and forums on disaster risk reduction. We also utilize these outcomes in our social contribution activities and disseminate relevant information to the public. Additionally, we proactively participate in initiatives and events related to climate change to disseminate the outcomes and details of our industry-academia research activities to the world and engage in multi- stakeholder dialogue to share information about the latest research projects and discuss how to promote disaster prevention.

59 《Research on Climate Change and Natural Disaster Risk》 ■ Building a Society Capable of Adapting to Climate Change and Weather Disaster Risk. 
By matching forecasts of future changes in risk due to climate change and other meteorological risk assessment approaches to a base of conventional risk assessment approaches, Tokio Marine Group is aiming to create a more advanced approach to climate change and weather disaster risk assessment.
Utilizing Research Outcomes to Provide Products and Services for Adapting to Climate Change. 
There is a concern that damage concerning natural disasters will increase due to climate change and the resulting greater fluctuations in natural phenomena. Tokio Marine Group is promoting initiatives to resolve weather and other disaster issues and mitigate disaster damage through its business operations. However, as changes in climate and fluctuations in natural phenomena increase, using only the past disaster and insured contingency data may prevent appropriate weather disaster risk assessment and may reduce our ability to provide insurance products and services covering weather disaster risk to customers and local communities as we have done previously.
In response, Tokio Marine Group seeks to promote research on climate change and weather disaster risk in collaboration with the world’s leading scientists and researchers and to use research outcomes and other various findings broadly to the benefit of society. Simultaneously, as a corporate group engaging in the insurance business, we intend to translate our research activities into the ability to sustainably provide insurance products and related services to customers and local communities.
Tokio Marine Group will continue to forge ahead with research on climate change and natural disaster risk with the world’s leading scientists and researchers through industry-academia collaboration and proactively leverage knowledge gained through such research.

Also, in the chart showing central atmospheric pressure, blue represents locations where central atmospheric pressure will decrease in the future.
Joint Research with Nagoya University: Analysis of Changes in Precipitation Trend due to. 
Global Warming • With the aim of forecasting how climate phenomenon such as typhoons and torrential downpours are changing along with climate change, the Tokio Marine Research Institute is performing joint research with Nagoya University on changes in the precipitation pattern resulting from global warming. Professor Kazuhisa Tsuboki from the Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research at Nagoya University, our partner in this joint research, has developed a high spatial resolution model capable of performing detailed simulation of such aspects as clouds and precipitation, and is advancing research into the mechanisms of torrential rain, typhoons and other phenomena.
• As an example, the charts below show the results using Nagoya University’s high spatial resolution model to simulate the July 2018 heavy rain. Comparing the chart on the left showing the simulation results and the chart on the right showing the actual observed rainfall amounts, we can see that the simulation has adeptly re-created precipitation volume.
• Currently, we are carrying out survey and analysis of torrential rain patterns under future climate conditions by using the Database for Policy Decision-Making for Future Climate Change (“d4PDF”), a database created through a large-scale ensemble experiment.
Joint Research with Kyoto University: Assessment of Water Disaster Risk under Future Climate. 
Conditions • The Tokio Marine Research Institute is engaging in joint research with Kyoto University with the aim of quantitatively assessing changes in water disaster risk under future climate conditions. By also leveraging know-how for estimating precipitation volume under future climate conditions, which has been gained through joint research with Nagoya University, we are conducting research on methods to assess water disaster risk under future climate conditions.

The lessons have been provided at schools to more than 10,000 children in Japan. The scope of the activity is expanding from Tohoku to other regions, which are likely to be affected by an impending earthquake in the Nankai. 
Trough and its subsequent tsunami. Overseas, the activity is now carried out also in Hawaii, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines.
The lessons translate the knowledge cultivated through disaster science research of IRIDeS into educational materials that describe disaster risk from a scientific viewpoint, yet in a manner easily comprehensible by children. An original group work tool incorporating elements of brain science and cognitive psychology, “Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Stamp Rally (stamp collecting game),” has also been developed and is used as a teaching aid. As we surveyed and analyzed changes in children’s awareness, we discovered that there is a regional distinction in basic levels of disaster risk awareness between disaster-prone regions and disaster-free regions. Both groups show similarly higher risk awareness immediately after the lessons, but a decline in awareness over time is greater in the second group than in the first group. In the face of increasing and diversifying disasters, it is essential to provide disaster prevention education on a continuous basis for promoting disaster prevention and mitigation.
Children who have received our school disaster mitigation awareness lessons are now leading disaster prevention in their local communities. Among similar initiatives undertaken by universities nationwide, our lessons are unique in that these are social contribution activities covering much greater areas. At the Japan Resilience Awards 2018, our initiative won a gold award in the Educational. 
Institutions category. Tokio Marine Group will continue to collaborate with Tohoku University and facilitate activities to raise children’s disaster prevention awareness.

《Delivering a Sense of Security before a Disaster》 ■Consulting for Establishment of Business Continuity Management (BCM)
In the wake of the Great East Japan Earthquake and floods in Thailand, there has been a significant change in the business continuity initiatives of Japanese companies, with a shift away from a focus on a company’s own bases toward an approach that encompasses the entire supply chain. To ensure business continuity and quick recovery even in the event of earthquakes and group infectious diseases such as new strains of influenza and other unexpected contingencies faced by customers,
Tokio Marine & Nichido Risk Consulting provides support for the formulation of business continuity plans (BCPs) encompassing supply chains and the establishment of business continuity management (BCM) for continually improving these business continuity initiatives.
Tokio Marine & Nichido Risk Consulting: Business Continuity Management (BCM)/
Business Continuity Plan (BCP) (in Japanese) ■Natural Disaster Consulting. 
The Great East Japan Earthquake and floods in Thailand prompted numerous Japanese companies to reaffirm their awareness of the importance of risk management, and the interest of companies in natural disaster risk remains high. With the aim of protecting customers from such natural disasters as earthquakes and typhoons, Tokio Marine & Nichido Risk Consulting employs original analysis models to quantitatively identify in advance any earthquake and typhoon risks that may vary among regions or types of facilities and, based on this analysis, provides cost-effective risk mitigation solutions for customers. For risks concerning earthquakes, in particular, we also provide such services as developing estimates of earthquake damage based on the results of field surveys and document reviews as well as diagnosis of antiseismic capability of buildings and tsunami simulation models.

Group, including its agents, conduct Disaster Prevention. 
Lessons to convey knowledge on disaster prevention to children and help them prepare for a next disaster.
Disaster Prevention Lessons are a program to raise readiness for disaster prevention among elementary school children. Employee volunteers from Tokio Marine & Nichido Risk Consulting developed educational materials, which were then supervised by the endowed research division named the Earthquake- induced Tsunami Risk Evaluation Field established within the International Research Institute of. 
Disaster Science (IRIDeS) at Tohoku University, with which Tokio Marine & Nichido has entered into an industry-academia collaborative agreement concerning the assessment of earthquake and tsunami risk. In the lessons, children learn about the mechanisms that cause earthquakes and tsunamis and think about how to protect themselves in an earthquake and what preparations should be made in advance, including what to take with them in an emergency, through a quiz and group discussion.
The aim is to cultivate a correct understanding of earthquakes among children and the ability to prepare themselves for an impending disaster. Disaster Prevention Lessons began in fiscal 2012, and as of March 31, 2019, have been held about 540 times at elementary schools and special needs schools across Japan, with approximately 40,050 children attending. Recently, needs for lessons “delivered” to schools are on the rise, and there has been an increasing number of cases where local governments and educational institutions collaborate with companies in providing such lessons. We will continue to deliver safety and security by engaging in awareness and educational activities for disaster readiness through our Disaster Prevention Lessons.

Organizations. 
Tokio Marine & Nichido offers a program to assist in the formulation of business continuity plans (BCP) for small and medium-sized companies. About 100 employees nationwide, who have completed the required training, serve as lecturers and offer a workshop free of charge in collaboration with our partners, including respective local governments, chambers of commerce, commerce and industry associations and financial institutions. Unlike a lecture-style seminar, the workshop starts with a simulation for participants to experience an earthquake to cultivate keener awareness for the need of a BCP. Then, participants engage in group work to create an outline of a BCP. After the workshop, the company provides follow-up services to help the companies complete their respective BCPs.
■Booklet Entitled “Rethink Now! Earthquake in the Foreseeable Future and Preparation for It” and “Easy, Understandable BCP Planning Sheet”
We have developed “Rethink Now! Earthquake in the Foreseeable Future and Preparation for It,” a booklet designed to raise awareness of earthquake risk, and “Easy, Understandable BCP Planning. 
Sheet,” a tool for small and medium-sized companies to grasp an overall picture of a BCP in one sheet and make their first step in formulating their own BCPs. The booklet and planning sheet are together available in multiple versions by business type, covering such industries as manufacturing, construction, retail and transportation in addition to hotels/inns and nursing homes for the elderly.
These tools are also intended to enable companies to raise the level of their own BCPs as well as their entire supply chain’s BCPs and to make these BCPs more viable by disseminating and instilling the idea of BCP among their employees. Through our employees and agents, we distribute these combined tools to companies, local governments, chambers of commerce and commerce and industry associations.

As part of this effort, and to promote revitalization of regional economies by making the most of the expanding inbound market, the company initiated services free of charge in July 2016 to customers subscribing to its Comprehensive Business Insurance Program, a nationwide group insurance scheme for chamber of commerce members, including a multilingual telephone interpretation service and an inbound consulting service, to help customers set up a system to solicit and accept inbound tourists.
On January 12, 2017, the company’s efforts to implement services for supporting domestic operators of inbound businesses received ministerial commendation as a fiscal 2016 model example of regional economy revitalization initiatives being promoted by financial and other organizations.
As one pillar of our regional revitalization efforts, we will continue to seek growth of regional economies by offering safety and security to foreign visitors, the number of which is expected to increase further in the future, and by assisting Japanese inbound business operators in setting up a system to accept these visitors.
In response to the growing inbound market, starting from July 2019 the services have been expanded to include all customers who have enrolled in Super Business Insurance.

■Supporting Safety and Security via Smartphones. 
Smartphones accounted for about 90% of mobile phones sold domestically in fiscal 2018 and have been rapidly gaining popularity among users.
Tokio Marine & Nichido provides the free smartphone app Mobile Agent to customers. Policyholders use this app to check insurance-related points of contact (including our agents) or make contact with them and view details of their policies anytime, anywhere. It also has several features that ensure smooth response upon a traffic accident or vehicle failure.
These include an accident reporting feature that identifies the location of an accident via GPS, a simple procedure to request a tow truck in a minimum of three taps, a function to easily send photographs of a damaged vehicle or accident site taken by a policyholder to Tokio Marine & Nichido and a function to enable the real-time monitoring of accident response status via push notifications. Since January 2016, we have provided a smartphone service, B-Contact, which is based on the latest Internet of Things (IoT) technology, to support automatic notification of a traffic accident to an insurance agent. The service automatically detects the possible occurrence of an accident and allows the customer to report the accident in one tap. In December 2016, we rolled out a service to provide disaster and crime prevention information in real time through push notifications to allow customers to prepare for natural disasters. Starting from January 2019, functional improvements have ■Preparing for Typhoons and Torrential Downpours by Using “Personalized” Videos.

These videos can be viewed from PCs, smartphones and tablet devices, and the company provides a service on a regular basis for customers to check information on disaster risks and details of coverage in an easy-to-understand manner.

We will continue to further strengthen our platform for interacting with customers digitally through Mobile Agent.
Additionally, E. design Insurance allows customers to complete overall procedures, from requesting an estimate to final application for auto insurance, via smartphone. A dedicated web page is set up for each customer to report accidents and verify accident response status in addition to making changes to contract details and renewal procedures. The smartphone app Accident Site Call enables easily and quickly make reports in case of accidents or car troubles. The actual location is notified via. 
GPS so that customers can immediately request for the SECOM Accident On-site Rush Service or road service even in an unfamiliar place.

Reducing Poverty ■ Increasing Prevalence of Weather Insurance and Microinsurance in India. 
Poverty Issue among Farmers in India. 
Agriculture is a key industry in India’s economy, with about 50% of the country’s working population being farmers. As most water for agricultural use is from rainwater, farmers may suffer serious economic consequences when agricultural production decreases due to drought or excessive rains.
Thus, stabilizing farmers’ living is a critical challenge for the country.
Development of Weather Insurance and Microinsurance Jointly with IFFCO-TOKIO. 
In 2001, Tokio Marine Group established IFFCO-TOKIO General. 
Insurance Co., Ltd. (IFFCO-TOKIO), a non-life insurance company, as a joint venture with Indian Farmers Fertiliser. 
Cooperative Limited (IFFCO), which has a nationwide network of 38,000 member cooperatives, and began offering auto, fire and other insurance in India. From the start, the business tackled the issue of how to resolve the lifestyle of uncertainty faced by farmers in India through the mechanism of insurance and looked into the development of weather insurance and microinsurance (i.e., insurance available at low cost). These products are becoming essential in stabilizing the lives of people in farming communities, with 16.4 million policies and 19.2 billion rupees (approximately 30.8 billion yen) in premiums written in fiscal 2018.
In 2001, the company, in collaboration with IFFCO, started sales in India’s rural communities of Sankatharan Bima Yojna, low-cost accident insurance available for 1 rupee (about 2 yen)

IFFCO-TOKIO’s Efforts to Increase Prevalence of Medical Insurance for Low-Income Earners. 
Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojna (RSBY) is a medical insurance scheme for low-income earners sponsored by the government of India. It was launched in 2008 in India through joint efforts among insurance companies, medical institutions and the government. Subscribers to RSBY only need to pay 30 rupees (about 50 yen) per household as a registration fee with coverage up to 30,000 rupees annually (about 50,000 yen) for a maximum of five persons per household in case medical services are required for injury or illness. IFFCO-TOKIO began selling RSBY in 2011 and launched add- on medical insurance in 2014 under Biju Krushak Kalyan Yojana (BKKY), another insurance scheme for low-income families sponsored by a state government. The company has delivered security to approximately 12.54 million people with low incomes. Also, the company has been working to spread the use of insurance and promote its sales mostly in the southern state of Karnataka, the central state of Madhya Pradesh and the eastern states of Odisha and Tripula in India. In fiscal 2018, as the sum of. 
RSBY and BKKY, the company provided security by way of medical insurance to around 17.87 million people and paid approximately 580 million rupees (about 990 million yen) in total in insurance claims. RSBY and BKKY have become essential medical insurance schemes for people who previously could not receive sufficient medical services because of their economic situation.

77 ■Reducing World Poverty. 
Establishing Japan’s First Fund to Invest in Microfinance-Related Assets. 
Microfinance is a system to provide financial services, including microcredit loans (small loans usually provided without collateral), savings and insurance, to low-income entrepreneurs who traditionally have no access to these services. The system, for example, provides short-term loans to low-income households, and they use these funds to buy chickens. When they pay off loans in full using profits generated from the sale of eggs and poultry products, the system in turn provides funds to build a chicken coop. The major characteristic of microfinancing is that it helps people get out of poverty and become financially independent. It has recently drawn much attention in the international community as a social investment tool that provides direct aid for and generates immediate outcomes in reducing poverty around the world. The number of financial institutions providing microfinance services to low-income entrepreneurs mainly in developing countries (Microfinance. 
Institutions – MFIs) has begun to show rapid growth.
The Daiwa Microfinance Fund, established and managed by Tokio Marine Asset Management, provides direct financing (loans) to MFIs and purchases corporate bonds and negotiable certificates of deposit (negotiable CDs) issued by MFIs. The fund also purchases bonds issued by the International. 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development and other international financial institutions that are keenly working to improve the business environment for MFIs. Microcredits provided under the microfinancing system generally show a high ratio of repayment and a low tendency of turning into bad loans. Thus, investments in MFIs are simultaneously investments in businesses with high potential.

Initiative to Support Low Incomes in the United States. 
The Tokio Marine North America Services (TMNAS) Finance Team has implemented an initiative to support low incomes via the reduced tax burden with Philadelphia Insurance Companies (PHLY) and their long-time business partner Affordable Equity Partners (AEP).
The housing complexes developed by AEP and their partners are financed through the sale of the tax credits to PHLY, and when completed are rented to low income members of the communities. PHLY benefits via the reduced tax burden made possible by the tax credits purchased from AEP. So far,
PHLY has invested over US$2.25 million, which has gone toward the 2,500 units across six states in the United States. The relationship is a “win-win-win” for PHLY, TMNAS and AEP and the 2,500 families living in the beautiful new facilities.

Subscribers to RSBY and BKKY are given a biometric card. Information regarding insurance and consultation at a medical institution is managed on the card and customers can choose to have a consultation at one of more than 10,000 public or private medical institutions in.

Core Theme 2: Protecting the Earth. 
CSR & ESG Highlights. 
Global environmental issues are both old and new issues and thus continuous global environmental and biodiversity protection initiatives are paramount. In addition, our social life is being threatened by the frequent occurrence of natural disasters such as typhoons, droughts and torrential rains around the world due to climate change.
The global issues of “climate change and natural disasters” and “biodiversity depletion” pose serious risks for the children not only of today but also of the future and at the same time have a significant impact on the business of Tokio Marine Group.
Having set “Protecting the Earth” as a core CSR theme, Tokio Marine Group is taking steps to reduce the environmental footprint in business activities in which all employees participate, reduce the environmental footprint in the supply chain and tackle initiatives related to environmental management aimed at becoming carbon neutral based on efforts to deploy our environmental management system. Moreover, we continuously work to provide products and services that are designed to mitigate or adapt to climate change and protect biodiversity, and to implement environmental protection activities as well as regional and social contribution activities that include environmental awareness raising and education. Through these initiatives, we actively contribute to preservation of the global environment, protection of biodiversity and the creation of environmental value.
CSR Materiality(Material Issues)
Efforts to implement environmental protection activities resulted in a reduction in CO2 emissions by 3.2% (Scope 1, 2 and 3 year on year) and carbon neutral status (seventh time in sixth consecutive years).
Tokio Marine Group promoted the development of clean energy through such means as providing insurance supporting offshore wind power generation.
Tokio Marine Group strengthened ties with NGOs and local communities through the Green Gift Project.

Benefits of Mangrove Planting for the Environment and Local Life “Mangrove” is a generic term for flora that thrives in brackish waters (where seawater and fresh water meet) along tropical and subtropical coastlines and river mouths in Asia, Africa and South America.
Mangroves are sometimes referred to as “forests in the sea” and are effective in mitigating global warming as they absorb and fix large volumes of CO2, a major cause of global warming. They also serve as natural levees to protect people’s lives and local ecosystems from tidal waves, tsunamis and other natural disasters.
Mangroves protected the lives of many people as well as buildings and structures when the tsunami that occurred in the Indian Ocean hit in December 2004 and the typhoon that wreaked havoc in the. 
Philippines in November 2013 (named Yolanda in the Philippines and Haiyan in English). At present, mangroves are being planted in the Demak area of Indonesia and Gujarat State in India, which are susceptible to coastal erosion and flooding, with the main objective being to protect people’s lives and keep buildings and structures intact.
The roots of mangrove trees also serve as “cradles of life,” creating a rich ecosystem by providing a sanctuary for living creatures such as young fish, shellfish, crabs and shrimps that feed off mangrove leaves and berries while attracting monkeys and birds, and also because the roots help ensure a gentle tide and waves at high tide and maintain water temperature. Fish and shellfish caught in the sea and in rivers near mangrove forests in.

Tokio Marine Group considers mangroves as “insurance for the future of the Earth” because they protect the planet and people’s lives and bring benefits. We are committed to being involved in the. 
Mangrove Planting Project for 100 years. The project has been up and running for 19 years to date and the mangrove forests continue to grow. Going forward, we plan to put more effort into activities that protect and nurture mangrove forests.
■Economic Value and Impact on Local Communities from Mangrove Planting. 
To the present, mangrove planting has generated diverse benefits such as mitigating and preventing global warming, preserving biodiversity and contributing to the development of local economies, communities and human resources. However, expressing the specific economic value created by this project had proved difficult. To determine this value, Tokio Marine & Nichido commissioned Mitsubishi. 
Research Institute, Inc. to undertake a survey and make assessments based on internationally recognized methods. The results of provisional calculations show that the total economic value created by the Mangrove Planting Project from April 1999 when the company started the planting to the end of March 2018 totaled 118.5 billion yen. This project also impacts some 1.41 million people living where the mangroves are planted or nearby and has generated benefits in terms of improving the lives of residents in these communities and preventing and mitigating disasters. By ascertaining the numerical value of the outcomes of the mangrove-planting activities, we were able to reaffirm our awareness of the positive social impact of this initiative. Going forward, we will utilize the results of this value assessment to improve our Mangrove Planting Project and continue to undertake these activities together with our stakeholders as we aim to further create value.

83 ■ Mangrove Planting Tours. 
Since 1999, Tokio Marine & Nichido has been promoting its Mangrove Planting Project in Southeast. 
Asia and other countries and regions and conducting a volunteer tour to plant mangrove trees about once a year. Tokio Marine Group employees, agents and retired employees as well as their families participate in these tours as volunteers to plant mangrove seeds and saplings with local residents and children and visit villages and elementary schools in respective regions to promote international exchange. As of March 2019, we have conducted 19 mangrove planting volunteer tours, in which a total of approximately 590 members have participated.
■Green Gift Project: Educational Support Program in Developing Countries. 
We provide educational support for children in areas that we plant mangroves through such measures as participating in Room to Read’s Educational Support Program in Developing Countries.
■Green Gift Planet GENKI Program. 
Tokio Marine & Nichido is implementing the Green Gift. 
Planet GENKI Program, which tackles environmental protection initiatives together with local citizens and includes donations to environmental NPOs and other groups as well as participation in environmental activities throughout Japan.
The project is conducted in conjunction with Japan NPO Center, a specified non-profit corporation that has received backing from the Ministry of the Environment and is responsible for the coordination and operation of the entire project. The aim is to provide children in each region, the leaders of the future, with the opportunity to learn about local environmental issues and foster a desire to protect the environment.
The activities offer the chance for local NPOs and other groups to collaborate with new stakeholders such as Tokio Marine & Nichido and its agents. It is also a great chance for the company’s customer contact branches to meet with local governments, environmental NPOs and other members of the local community. As of March 2019, around 15,500 participants (including around 6,100 children) had taken part in 247 different events to protect local forests, woodlands, river valleys and the sea.

■Tree-Planting Together with Customers ~PHLY 80K Trees Initiative~
Philadelphia Insurance Companies (PHLY) has continued to conduct the “PHLY 80K Trees” tree planting program since 2015, inspired by Tokio Marine & Nichido’s Green Gift Project. With the cooperation of customers and agents, the initiative has provided the funding for 320,000 trees to date through costs saved by encouraging customers to make electronic payments and asking agents to cooperate by making direct deposits of commissions and reducing the preparation of paper statements as well as donations from the company. In 2019, 35 PHLY employees participated in a tree-planting tour, with more than 150 employees having offered their time since the initiative began. Funding from an additional 80,000 trees will be provided between 2019 and 2020.
In the United States, record wildfires, storms and other natural disasters have destroyed millions of trees in forests in recent years. PHLY is on a mission to build healthy forests and ecosystems to provide greater security to communities.

Preventing Global Warming by Promoting the Development of Clean Energy. 
In order to prevent damage due to climate change from spreading, Tokio Marine Group is examining the possibility of installing and operating renewable energy facilities in Group companies while also providing products and services such as liability insurance concerning environmental pollution and environmental consulting.
Examining the possibility of clean energy facilities • Specialized Insurance Package for Offshore Wind Power Generation • Mega-Solar Package Program • Environmental Consulting. 
We are undertaking the following actions to achieve the goals described above in the three areas of examining the possibility of clean energy facilities, operating clean energy facilities and credits gained from clean energy facilities.
Credits gained from clean energy facilities • Specialized Insurance Package for Offshore Wind Power Generation • Impairment Liability Coverage for Geothermal Power Generation Operators • Environmental Impairment Liability Coverage • Environmental Consulting.

Offshore Wind Power Generation in Japan. 
Japan has set the ambitious goal of reducing greenhouse gases by 80% by 2050, thereby proceeding with the challenges of energy conversion and decarbonization to meet this goal. The 5th Strategic. 
Energy Plan approved by the Cabinet on July 3, 2018 states the lofty “3E + S” (Energy security,
Economical efficiency, Environment + Safety) objective and expresses the energy mix the country would like to achieve by 2030. This was the first time for Japan to specify the shift to renewable energy as its main source of power, with the aim of 22% to 24% of power generation to come from renewable energy by 2030, up from 16% in 2017. Offshore wind power generation is expected to be one of the pillars of renewable energy. The revised Port and Harbor Act of July 2016 and the enforcement of the Act of Promoting Utilization of Sea Areas in Development of Power Generation. 
Facilities Using Maritime Renewable Energy Resources in April 2019 have raised expectations for offshore wind power generation in Japan.
Total Support for Offshore Wind Power Generation from Construction Phase to Operation Phase. 
Beginning with underwriting insurance for a project in the Netherlands in 2013 that the customer has acquired rights for, Tokio Marine & Nichido has been supporting a total of 24 offshore wind power generation projects in seven countries and regions including Japan, with total power generation capacity of 8GW. In fiscal 2018, while taking on seven new projects, we have provided support to the wind power generation industry in Japan by presenting and sharing the know-how we have gained by underwriting these projects, particularly in terms of loss prevention, at international conferences and seminars.
In many cases, insurance for offshore wind power generation projects is designed for the period of transition to operational status for each part that has been constructed. Our package exclusively designed for such projects, on the other hand, offers seamless total support in order to cover the interface risk associated with the shift to operation. Although this insurance package is generally employed in Europe and the United. 
States, the content of the insurance and the composition of the agreement have been adjusted to fit the legal system and environment of Japan.

A dedicated team was set up to deal with wind power-related projects in 2013, and a task force was established in 2018 to provide company- wide support for the industry. Tokio Marine & Nichido aims to be the industry leader from an insurance perspective for offshore wind power generation projects, an area expected to grow and develop not only in. 
Japan and Asia but across the entire world, and to accelerate initiatives to enhance the global environment in the process.
Stochastic Assessment of Natural Disasters. 
The risk of a natural disaster occurring such as a typhoon, earthquake or tsunami is significantly different between Japan and Europe. In arranging insurance for wind power generation projects,
Tokio Marine & Nichido Risk Consulting calculated the critical indicator of Probable Maximum Loss (PML) using stochastic methods and conducts risk assessment. In many cases, financing has become an integral part of offshore wind power generation projects as they grow in scale. Lenders also want to understand the risk involved using stochastic assessments that use a fixed return period, or estimated average time between events such as 475 years for an earthquake and 100 years for a typhoon.
With the launch of Japan’s Feed-in Tariff Scheme for Renewable Energy in July 2012, the planning and construction of “mega-solar” large-scale solar power generation facilities is surging across the country. In order for businesses to stably operate the facilities, measures are necessary to evaluate business risks over a long term of 10 to 20 years and from a variety of angles, starting from the installation stage.
In July 2012, Tokio Marine & Nichido began marketing its Mega-Solar Package Program. Through risk consulting and insurance products, the program offers an integrated solution for the risks involved in mega-solar projects.
Making Use of Evolving Risk Assessment Approaches in Consulting. 
The Mega-Solar Package Program is composed of 1) risk consulting (natural disaster risk assessment and soil contamination status assessment) and 2) arrangement of property and casualty insurance.
In the event of damage from earthquake, tsunami, water, wind, high tide or other natural disasters, mega-solar projects may be forced to review installation expenses or construction times, and business operation following launch may be severely affected.
Based on natural disaster information and knowledge accumulated over years in the property and casualty insurance business, the product offers risk consulting services that include a three-stage evaluation of natural disaster risks at planned mega-solar installation sites and soil contamination status assessment consulting through means such as site usage history surveys and field investigations. By incorporating such consulting, mega-solar business operators are able to accurately assess the risks that can threaten business continuity and can effectively carry out necessary investments and measures.
Conducting risk assessments of mega-solar projects has helped us build up extensive know-how, which we are using to start consulting services for renewable energy facilities for biomass and wind- power generation businesses.

Tokio Marine & Nichido Risk Consulting’s “Risk Assessment of Renewable Energy Facilities” (in Japanese) ■Arrangement of Appropriate Property and Casualty Insurance at the Mega-Solar Project. 
Installation and Operational Stages. 
As various risks are expected at every stage – from installation to operation – in mega–solar projects, appropriate risk management is achieved by analyzing risk factors that can impact project management and by arranging for insurance against each risk. Looking specifically at risks to installation work, insurance involves compensation for damages in the event of accidents originating in solar power systems during installation or after completion, including damage to or destruction of solar systems or temporary installations from calamities such as fire or lightning, as well as accompanying loss of profits due to delay of operation. Risk hedging against the preceding factors is possible through erection all risks insurance, delayed start of operations insurance and various forms of liability insurance. With regard to risks to operation, insurance involves compensation for damages originating in ownership or management of facilities, including damage to or destruction of solar power systems from calamities such as fire, as well as accompanying loss of profits if operation is halted. Risk hedging against the preceding is possible through commercial property insurance and various forms of liability insurance.
Solar power and other forms of renewable energy are indispensable as new energy sources to support the social infrastructure of the future. Based on the role that insurance companies bear in society, Tokio Marine & Nichido will support the smooth diffusion of renewable energy by providing insurance products and risk consulting services and contribute to the development of a sustainable society.
■Commenced Sales of New Impairment Liability Coverage for Geothermal Power Generation. 
Operators. 
Geothermal power generation does not emit any CO2, a primary cause of global warming, which has put it in the spotlight as a low-cost renewable energy with the potential for stable power supply.
There are high expectations for the application of this form of energy and the government has even formulated a plan to expand capacity of geothermal power generation facilities three-fold by 2030 compared with current levels.
Against this backdrop, in June 2016 Tokio Marine & Nichido started sales of a “geothermal package plan” that underwrites such risk as property risk, construction risk and liability risk from ground surveys to operations for geothermal developers. Within this “geothermal package plan,” liability risk compensation provides peace of mind to nearby hot spring operators (hot spring union) with regard to geothermal development. This is achieved through compensation for damages if there is a decline in the volume of hot water or a change in hot spring quality in a nearby hot spring area during geothermal development or operation of a geothermal power generation facility. Such damages include the cost of investigation into the cause, which is covered by the geothermal developer, or lost profit on the part of the hot spring operator. Payment of the cost for investigating the cause at the stage when a reduction in hot spring volume or a change in spring quality has been objectively.

In December 2010, Tokio Marine & Nichido acquired the first auto insurance Eco Mark*1 certification for financial products from the Japan Environment Association (JEA) for its efforts to promote various initiatives in the environment-related field. These included promotion of the Green Gift Project, dissemination of information on eco-safe driving and accident reduction via the company website, increased use of recycled parts in auto repairs and premium discount services for hybrid, electric and compressed natural gas vehicles.
In 2011, Tokio Marine & Nichido won the Silver Prize in the Eco Mark Award 2011*2 sponsored by JEA, becoming the first company in the financial industry to receive an Eco Mark award. In granting the award, JEA highly recognized the company’s efforts to promote the widespread use and increase the visibility of Eco Mark-certified auto insurance products (creation of Eco Mark awareness posters and extensive use of the Eco Mark label on auto insurance leaflets and renewal notices) and to offer eco- friendly auto insurance that allows policyholders to participate in activities to reduce environmental impact through the Green Gift Project. Becoming carbon neutral in its domestic business activities in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 was another point that was recognized by JEA.
Tokio Marine & Nichido and Nisshin Fire & Marine Insurance (“Nisshin Fire”) have been undertaking an initiative to promote environment-conscious auto repairs following accidents with the cooperation of customers. This initiative, contingent upon the approval of customers, encourages the repair, not replacement, of parts damaged in an accident or the use of recycled or rebuilt parts if the damage is beyond repair, to reduce industrial waste and utilize resources more effectively. Following “The. 
Declaration of the Promotion of the Use of Recycled Parts,” a joint statement made by The General. 
Insurance Association of Japan and its member insurance companies in October 2011, we have decided to step up this initiative by generally requiring the use of recycled parts when repairing company-owned vehicles and encouraging their use in personal vehicles of employees.
For the same reason, Nisshin Fire provides an environment-conscious auto insurance, Asante, which provides a 10% discount on insurance premiums if a car repair is done using recycled parts at one of the automobile excellent repair shops specified by the company.

CSR & ESG Highlights. 
In Japan, the importance of responding to the nursing and health needs of the elderly is increasing due to the low birth rate and aging society. There is also growing demand to create societies in which people in underprivileged circumstances and those with disabilities can live with peace of mind in the community as economies and societies become more sophisticated and globalization progresses. In addition, there are calls for the acceptance, promotion and utilization of diversity in such areas as gender, age and nationality. On a global scale, the reality is that there is growing income disparity, increasing unemployment among youth, poverty and unequal opportunities for education based on gender.
Tokio Marine Group has set “Supporting People” as a core CSR theme in order to take up the challenge of resolving these issues. To this end, we will promote local community and social contribution activities supporting people through the growth of young people and support the elderly, persons with disabilities and athletes as well as the promotion of diversity and inclusion.

❖ Section composition ■“Dementia Support Plan” and “Pension-Type Nursing Care Coverage Plan with Additional. 
Coverage for Dementia”
In recent years, the number of people in need of nursing care and suffering from dementia has been on the rise in line with an aging society, and these are the issues that many people can readily relate to. Based on a desire to play a part in resolving this social dilemma, Tokio Marine & Nichido is focused on the provision of products and services corresponding to care and dementia.
In January 2019, we launched the industry’s first Dementia Support Plan, an exclusive insurance for dementia patients and their families, with the aim of helping to realize a society for them to live vibrant lives with peace of mind. This product compensates search costs when a dementia patient goes missing and liability in daily life on the part of the sufferer or their family. In addition, in preparation for when a dementia patient goes missing, we provide emergency contact stickers from Safety Net Linkage, which has a proven track record in watch-over support for the elderly, as an added service to the product so they are quickly found and taken into protective custody.

In October 2019, we started providing a pension-type nursing care coverage plan with additional coverage for dementia. Based on our own research, it was clear that care compensation was not sufficiently meeting the expectations of policyholders. While the need for such compensation increases with age, standard private nursing insurance premiums during elderly years become progressively expensive. To resolve this issue, we designed a product with features that include replacing premiums to be paid when in need of care with fixed-term pension payments. This makes it easier to prepare for prolonged nursing care and provides more affordable premiums. Moreover, with the dementia-assistance package bundled to this product, a wide range of exclusive dementia- related services are available to help people live life with the disease, such as maintaining and enhancing brain functionality through special training.
■Initiatives for Living Benefits. 
What Is Life Insurance Revolution “Nextage”?
Tokio Marine Group provides optimum safeguards by protecting customers in all domains including life insurance. These safeguards encompass “new protection” in preparation for advancements in medical technology, “asset building” in preparation for old age with expectations of longer lifespans and “prevention and pre-symptomatic health” with the aim of maintaining health and preventing illness.
We will strive to become a life insurance company that continues to be chosen by developing products and services that protect customers.
■Initiatives for Longevity Risk: Academy of Health and Long Life. 
In February 2012, Tokio Marine & Nichido Life established the Academy of Health and Long Life section of its website to convey to the broadest possible audience the importance of disease prevention and health management in leading a healthy life long into the future. Tokio Marine & Nichido Life guides visitors through the academy, which includes the Health. 
Promotion Center for self-checking lifestyle-related diseases; the Infirmary for learning about how to read the results of physical examinations; the Retirement Preparations Center for learning about making financial preparations; and the Library for performing searches on diseases and nursing care. In this way, we make sure we provide ample information on lifestyle-related diseases, nursing care and other relevant topics.
We provide various information maintained by Tokio Marine & Nichido Life and other companies in. 
Tokio Marine Group, including Tokio Marine & Nichido Medical Service and Tokio Marine Nichido. 
Better Life Service, and business partners.
Tokio Marine & Nichido Life’s Academy of Health and Long Life (in Japanese) ■ Insurance Products to Facilitate the Advancement of Regenerative Medicine. 
At the timing of the enforcement of a new act to ensure the security of regenerative medicine in 2014, Tokio Marine &
Nichido has developed and released new insurance products related to regenerative medicine, namely, insurance for clinical research on regenerative medicine and liability insurance for cell-cultivating companies.
Regenerative medicine regenerates tissue and cells that have deteriorated due to illness or injury, for example, and helps with the recovery of physiological functions. It is expected to improve the quality of life (QOL) of patients, the elderly and people with disabilities and ensure a longer healthy life. In Japan, however, regenerative medicine is still in the process of developing into an industry and practical applications.

96. 
To accelerate the process, many players must enter the field. One drawback is the cost and risk involved in regenerative medicine. The solution, we believe, is insurance.
If new players and researchers can leverage insurance as a means to provide compensation for negative effects in people undergoing regenerative medicine treatments, and thus reduce the said cost and risk, there will be a better chance that more players would take on the challenge of developing regenerative medicine into an industry and practical applications. By providing such insurance products, Tokio Marine & Nichido will contribute to the advancement of regenerative medicine in Japan.
■Aruku Hoken. 
In 2017, Tokio Marine & Nichido Life developed Aruku Hoken with the concept of preemptively protecting customers from serious illnesses such as lifestyle-related diseases by supporting initiatives to improve customers’ health and quality of life. The product, the first of its kind in the industry, provides policyholders with a measurement device and returns a portion of insurance premiums in accordance with their health improvement activities, which are recorded using a special app.
■Seminar on Balancing Work with Elder Care: Helping Prevent the Need to Stop Work for Caregiving. 
Amid the rapidly aging society, “leaving full-time employment for elder care” has become a social issue of increasing prevalence. According to the government’s statistics, about 100,000 workers leave their job every year for the reason of elder care, while about 3.46 million people work while taking care of their elderly parents or relatives. For companies, it is an issue of losing the core group of their workforce since people leaving their job are mainly in their 40s and 50s. These caregivers, on the other hand, also bear a significant burden both economically and mentally because they have no idea for how long their days of caregiving will continue.
Tokio Marine Nichido Better Life Service provides seminars on balancing work with caregiving for employees of companies by leveraging know-how accumulated in the operation of caregiving services for the elderly. The seminars cover a broad range of topics from basic knowledge to implementing care, long-distance caregiving and dementia care. Also available are seminars for managers in the position of supporting their workers who are juggling both work and caregiving. In addition to the seminars,
Tokio Marine Nichido Better Life Service provides a menu that also covers how to create a handbook balancing work and caregiving that compiles information on caregiving as well as telephone consultation on caregiving and consultation through industrial care managers.
■ Pandemic Derivatives for the World Bank. 
In July 2017, Tokio Marine & Nichido participated in the “Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF)” launched by the World Bank as an international initiative to manage crises caused by infectious diseases. Through the underwriting of pandemic derivatives, we will support efforts by public-private partnerships to contain internationally threatening infectious diseases and contribute to the creation of a safe, secure and sustainable future.
Background to the Establishment of the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility. 
The Japanese government brought up the issue of international health when it was host country for the G7 Ise-Shima Summit in May 2016. With the cooperation of the World Bank and World. 
Health Organization (WHO), PEF was launched by the World Bank as a new financial mechanism for responding to public health crises that drew on lessons learned with the Ebola virus. The Japanese government was the first in the world to declare that it would provide financial assistance to PEF and called for the cooperation of other countries.
Overview of the Program. 
The PEF is the world’s first financing mechanism for swiftly and smoothly providing financial assistance in the event that a pandemic occurs or expands in developing countries, and is funded by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) of the World Bank Group through derivatives transactions between IBRD and insurance companies and the issuance of pandemic bonds to investors. In the case where data released by WHO, such as the number of deaths, rate of increase in the number of deaths and the number of affected countries, reach predetermined levels that have been established as criteria for funding assistance, Tokio Marine & Nichido will pay a preset amount to IBRD.

97 ■ Publication of a Book, Protecting Families and Companies – Guidebook on Combating Infectious Diseases. 
In April 2015, Tokio Marine & Nichido Risk Consulting wrote and published a book, Protecting Families and Companies – Guidebook on Combating Infectious. 
Diseases (supervised by Koji Wada, a doctor at the National Center for Global. 
Health and Medicine). The book uses many charts, tables and illustrations to explain in an easy-to-understand manner the risk of Ebola hemorrhagic fever, new strains of influenza and other infectious diseases and necessary measures to be taken by companies and individuals. Chapter 4 (Protecting Companies) of the book, in particular, describes in detail the characteristics of infectious diseases as risk to companies, minimum required measures, points to be noted when building a structure to ensure business continuity and other important points when implementing measures at overseas bases.
■Medical Assist : Providing 24/7 Telephone Support for Customers Seeking Advice on Illness or Injury. 
Medical Assist is a free health and healthcare consultation service that supports the health of policyholders and insurees of Tokio Marine & Nichido and Tokio Marine & Nichido Life, including their families. Assistance is provided via telephone 24 hours a day, seven days a week, including advice on everyday physical accidents, methods for handling emergencies such as sudden illnesses or injuries, information about hospitals, clinics and other medical facilities that examine patients on holidays or late at night, consultation with specialists in a range of more than 30 medical examination fields (by appointment only), and arrangements for transfer to other hospitals on behalf of patients. Such concerns are addressed by experienced and knowledgeable healthcare professionals including emergency medical specialists who take leading roles in emergency medical institutions, medical specialists qualified as university professors or assistant professors, and nurses with a wealth of clinical experience. Nurses make the initial response to customer inquiries, and depending on the case, emergency medical specialists and other medical staff address the issue thereafter as necessary.
For example, in the case of providing consultation about a child stung by a bee, an inquiry is first made to the caller about symptoms the child is showing. Then, the caller will be advised whether to seek emergency medical care, while receiving instructions on first aid best suited for the symptoms.
Medical Assist: Tokio Marine & Nichido Life (in Japanese) ■Supporting the Provision of Japanese-Language Medical Services in the United States. 
The Japanese Medical Practice outpatient clinic operated by Mount Sinai Beth Israel in New York City with donations from Tokio Marine & Nichido has been providing medical services in Japanese since 1990. At the event celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Japanese American Association of New. 
York held in fiscal 2009, the Japanese Medical Practice outpatient clinic offered medical consultation services and held medical seminars for elderly Japanese-American people living in New York. This clinic plays a major role in providing medical services to the local Japanese community and is highly regarded by the Japanese Consulate General in New York as a medical institution providing services to Japanese people.
■AED & Basic Life-Saving Workshop to Build a Society That Can Practice Life-Saving Skills. 
Tokio Marine Group provides a workshop to practice using. 
Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) and to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Around 5,357 employees from Tokio Marine Group attended the workshop by the end of fiscal 2017. Through the workshop, participants have realized that they do not have to be an expert to perform CPR and gained enough confidence to take action rather than just standing by in case of an emergency.
In cooperation with the Marunouchi Fire Station of the Tokyo. 
Fire Department (TFD), Tokio Marine & Nichido provided a workshop to learn standard first aid at its head office. Over the course of two training courses, lecturers from the fire station taught about 20 employees from Tokio Marine & Nichido and. 
Group companies how to use AEDs, perform CPR, prevent suffocation and stop bleeding. At the completion of these courses, participants received a first aid skills certificate issued by the TFD Fire Chief.

98 ■In Support of Customers’ Health and Productivity Management. 
As Japan’s labor force shrinks, managing employee health and creating a good working environment have become important management issues in order to ensure sustainable corporate growth. Tokio. 
Marine Group has formulated a philosophy and policy with employee health positioned as a core theme for management, and related issues are being addressed. We were selected as a “Health &
Productivity Stock” for the fourth consecutive year in recognition of these efforts. We support the promotion of corporate health and productivity through a range of services and group insurance supporting employee benefit programs in order to deliver the know-how we have gained from these initiatives to customers.
As an example, to help with the formulation of highly effective health promotion measures and the implementation of a PDCA cycle, we provide support for the quantitative analysis*1 of health- related issues by analyzing medical exams and prescriptions held by companies and health insurance associations; establishment of various corporate systems essential for promoting health and productivity management; and implementation of health promotion measures effective to contend with a variety of health-related issues.
Tokio Marine Group teams up with local public organizations to take steps aimed at limiting the incidence of diseases such as cancer among customers and in society. The movement also includes efforts by employee volunteers. Overseas, we conduct cancer awareness-raising activities and provide support for cancer sufferers through employee volunteers as well.
We also launched an investment trust that contributes a portion of the management fees to cancer research facilities.
■ Movement to Protect Customers from Cancer. 
Background of the Initiative. 
As part of efforts to fulfill its social mission as an insurance company providing cancer insurance,
Tokio Marine & Nichido Life has been supporting the Pink Ribbon Movement since March 2005.
Extending these activities, we have decided to steadily offer comprehensive solutions for customers’ concerns. As a first step, upon the release of an insurance product to support cancer treatment ■ Support for Mental Health Management. 
Depression is considered a modern-day illness, and a number of companies have implemented various measures to counter a growing patient population after the figure exceeded one million in 2008. Nevertheless, the number of claims filed and approved for workers’ compensation insurance for mental disorders has continued to rise. Consequently, mental health care of employees is rising in importance as an aspect of corporate risk management and management issues to be addressed in addition to being an integral part of corporate health and welfare. In particular, mental health measures are now required in order to be certified as a Health & Productivity Management. 
Organization, a move that is growing rapidly.
3. For the Health of Companies and Employees through Health and Productivity Management 4. Protecting Customers and Society from Cancer *1 We are systemizing indices for the quantitative evaluation of the effects of each measure by using data related to medical expenses and employees’ productivity (presenteeism, etc.) based on knowledge gained in joint research with the Health and Productivity Management (HPM) Policy Research Unit (currently Healthcare Data Science Research Unit*2 of the Institute of Future Initiatives) of The University of Tokyo Policy Alternatives Research Institute. *2 In the Government’s Basic Policy on Economic and Fiscal Management and Reform 2016 (“Big-Boned Policy”), two policy agendas were set: to improve the nation’s Quality of Life by analyzing Data Health introduced in the National Health Insurance and to enhance productivity by closely cooperating with businesses’ health and productivity management. The research aims to improve the feasibility and quality of health policies by visualizing health issues through Data Health and by understanding the trend of its effective solutions.
Tokio Marine & Nichido Medical Service offers the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to support the mental health management of companies. Besides conducting stress tests as required under the. 
Industrial Safety and Health Law (revised in December 2015), EAP provides a comprehensive menu of services by a team of experts including psychiatrists, clinical psychotherapists and personnel and labor consultants. These services range from individual follow-up for employees based on the results of employee stress checks to providing supportive care during a leave of absence or when returning to work, preventing recurrence, analyzing stress level tendencies in organizations and consulting on how to create a mental health framework.
As one mental health measure, popular courses such as “giving greetings at work” and “how to praise oneself” within a “health challenge campaign” that has been introduced at many companies with the aim of promoting the health of employees are helpful in enhancing the working environment and promoting self-care.
EAP is currently being used by more than 700,000 employees. We will continue to offer this program to everyone needing this type of support to assist them in maintaining better mental health.

99 in September 2007, we rolled out a company-wide, ongoing and perpetual initiative called the. 
Movement to Protect Customers from Cancer.
Basic Policy. 
In Japan, cancer is considered a national disease and is a source of much grief. The fact has fueled our desire to protect our customers from cancer to help ease the suffering of cancer patients and to assist their families going through the ordeal. For us, the social role of an insurance company now extends beyond delivering financial reassurance in terms of insurance payments to working to prevent cancer and providing mental support. Accordingly, Tokio Marine & Nichido Life has launched the Movement to Protect Customers from Cancer. The movement consists of the following three steps: (1) Getting to know cancer; (2) Talking about cancer; and (3) Helping with cancer countermeasures.
Collaboration with Local Authorities. 
An urgent task is to improve cancer examination rates in order to detect the disease at an early stage.
However, the checkup rate is lower than 50% targeted by the government and local authorities.
Based on the belief that joint action with as many people as possible is indispensable for improving the situation, Tokio Marine Group has signed agreements with 44 prefectural bodies and 18 cities (as of March 31, 2019) and has been actively promoting collaboration with them to call more attention to cancer and raise examination rates.
In October 2009, Tokio Marine & Nichido Life and Tokio Marine & Nichido became promoting partners for Corporate Actions for Cancer Checkups, a national project commissioned by the Ministry of. 
Health, Labour and Welfare to raise the cancer examination rate to more than 50% through joint efforts by the government and companies. By taking part in this public-private partnership, we intend to contribute to the improvement of the cancer examination rate in Japan.
Nationwide Regional Activities. 
Tokio Marine & Nichido Life encourages cancer education activities in its daily sales operations with the aim of disseminating cancer knowledge and increasing cancer examination rates. In addition to periodic cancer-related study sessions, exchange meetings and seminars for agents/consignees at branch offices across the country, we hold a national conference of employees and agent/consignee representatives who are actively and responsibly engaged in these cancer awareness efforts. More than 800 representatives participated in the 12th conference held in October 2018. This national conference served to extend knowledge and foster a strong sense of mission concerning cancer awareness through lectures by cancer patients and cancer life advisors as well as a panel discussion titled “What we can do to make customers smile.”
Agreement with the Shizuoka Cancer Center. 
In 2007, Tokio Marine & Nichido Life and Tokio Marine & Nichido. 
Medical Service (TMS) concluded a comprehensive agreement on joint research into the best ways to provide consultation, support and information regarding the treatment of cancer with the. 
Shizuoka Cancer Center. This joint research program has focused on such areas as jointly developing tools to communicate in plain language the importance of preventive medicine and medical checkups as well as knowledge on cancer.
Promoting the Pink Ribbon Movement. 
Tokio Marine & Nichido Life has been promoting the Pink Ribbon. 
Campaign in support of J.POSH, an NPO engaged in pink ribbon movements for breast cancer awareness in Japan, to convey the importance of medical exams and early detection of breast cancer. Tokio Marine Group employees, led by Tokio Marine &
Nichido Life employees, have continued to hold street campaigns nationwide and hand out awareness leaflets* since 2005.
Providing Encouragement to Cancer Patients by Making Terry Cloth Caps. 
Since 2009, Tokio Marine & Nichido Life has joined initiatives undertaken by the Iwate Hospice Association, a citizens’ group in Morioka City, Iwate Prefecture, to support cancer patients and their families and help them gain courage to fight against the disease. The company has been making terry cloth caps for patients undergoing anticancer drug treatment. Every year, participants from Tokio Marine & Nichido Life and other Tokio Marine Group companies and their families stitch the caps together and donate more than 1,000 caps as Christmas presents to cancer hospitals nationwide through the Iwate Hospice Association.
Education and Childcare Support for Orphans. 
Tokio Marine & Nichido Life established a fund in 2016 to financially support children who have. 
Shizuoka Cancer Center * The certified NPO J.POSH collaborates with medical institutions nationwide on the Japan Mammography Sunday (J.M.S) initiative to create an environment enabling women who are busy on weekdays to have mammograms on the third Sunday in October. Tokio Marine & Nichido Life also supports this initiative and hands out a list of available medical institutions.

Benefit-type scholarships of 300,000 yen per year are provided to students who have entered university or an equivalent educational institute. The. 
Kodomo Challenge series of educational materials developed by Benesse Corporation is sent free of charge every month to children in kindergarten and 30,000 yen is granted to celebrate advancing to the next grade and upon entering elementary school.
Donation to Organizations Helping Children with Incurable Diseases and Elderly People. 
Donations from Tokio Marine & Nichido Life’s employees and agents are used to support activities of organizations helping children undergoing medical treatment and elderly people. Employees of the company also provide support to the activities of these organizations through participation and other means. Donations have been made to the following organizations since fiscal 2016.
• NPO CliniClowns Association • The Support Network for NANBYO Children of Japan • NPO Dementia Friendship Club ■Providing Japan’s First Fund Specialized for Cancer Treatment. 
As a new initiative to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs, in July 2019 we established the. 
Tokio Marine Investment Trust to Fight Cancer (without currency hedging)/(with currency hedging) for investment in companies with a high probability of making a significant contribution to the resolution of cancer, a major social issue.
The fund aims to ensure return through investment in companies with strengths in the cancer treatment field (diagnostic examination, profiling, medical technology and pharmaceuticals) where there are expectations of significant growth and progress due to increasingly aging societies worldwide and advancements in genetic analysis technology. Another aim is to contribute to the achievement of Goal 3 of the 17 SDGs, namely “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.”
In addition to indirect contribution through investment in companies, we plan to make direct contribution by donating a portion of the management fees to National Cancer Center Japan, Japan. 
Cancer Society and other cancer research institutes.
Such direct assistance makes it possible to help organizations that find it difficult to get support through investment as well as to enable continued support through the management fees that are paid regularly every year.
5. R&D and Nurturing Human Resources. 
Tokio Marine Group provides support to Kyoto University’s Center for iPS Cell Research and. 
Application (CiRA), while handling the joint planning and development of health and productivity management apps using ICT. We also contribute to the development of young doctors responsible for providing medical care in the future.
■Supporting and Collaborating with the Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA),
Kyoto University. 
In January 2015, Tokio Marine & Nichido donated a total of 100 million yen to Kyoto University’s iPS Cell Research Fund, covering a five-year period. In addition, the company called for donations to the fund from employees of Tokio Marine Group companies and other individuals and made an additional donation exceeding 1.5 million yen in fiscal 2018.
Currently, the Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA) has been undertaking a project called the iPS Cell Stock for Regenerative Medicine to stockpile induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells for medical use. It involves collecting blood from donors having a special type of human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), which is thought to cause less immune rejection. In. 
August 2016, CiRA started collaborating with the medical corporate foundation Kaijo Building Clinic, a tie-up medical institution of Tokio Marine Group, to expand a donor base. Collection of blood, which had only been performed by Kyoto University Hospital, is now also conducted by the clinic. In. 
April 2017, the flying doctors of Tokio Marine & Nichido Medical Service also started cooperating in order to collect blood from willing donors who live in remote areas.
CiRA started providing iPS Cell Stock for Regenerative Medicine in August 2015 and plans to have enough iPS cell stock to cover 40% of the people in Japan by the end of fiscal 2018.
CiRA is working on research every day to enable the practical application of iPS cell technology.
Through our donations to the research fund, we hope to ease the suffering of people with intractable diseases and injuries and contribute to the establishment of a research environment that can stably obtain a pool of excellent researchers and research supporters and to the further advancement of research in this area. At the same time, we will continue to provide support to health, medical and other related fields to deliver safety and security in the form of risk management, including insurance, and through collaboration among Group companies.

Tokio Marine & Nichido conducted joint planning and development support for the cash benefit for the medical treatment portion of. 
Karada no Kimochi (“How my body feels”) service provided by docomo. 
Healthcare, Inc. from June 2013. Specifically, when the input data uncovers a change in body condition, the customer is encouraged to see a doctor and receives a cash benefit when medical advice and treatment are received from a qualified medical professional. In this way, it provides support that ensures a sense of security. The service has a high level of social significance because of its link to prevention and early detection of breast cancer and uterine cancer, two serious illnesses affecting women for which early detection efforts are lagging behind in Japan.
This service was recognized by the Celent Model Insurer Asia Awards 2014*1 by Celent, a U.S. research and consulting firm specialized in the financial field. It also received an excellent award in the Nihon.

United States.
In general, people wishing to experience clinical training in the United States are selected by way of a nationwide recruitment system. The N Program is handled differently, however, and has become an invaluable program for young Japanese doctors who want to undergo clinical training at an educational hospital in the United States. The N Program has made remarkable progress thanks to the cooperation of teachers at U.S. medical institutions and the efforts of residents who participated as trainee physicians. To date, the total number of trainees and graduates of this program has grown to over 180.

I received a notice of the expiration of my compulsory auto liability insurance by postcard. I wanted to renew the policy but couldn’t because it was more than a month before the expiration date. The postcard did explain when to renew the policy but I didn’t see it because it was in tiny fonts.
【Response】
For policies that expire in and after July 2018, we started providing the statement “Customers can start the renewal process for their compulsory auto liability insurance for small and light motorcycles that are not subjected to legally required vehicle inspections one month prior to the date of expiration shown on the right” in boldface.

To provide high-quality claims services in case of an emergency to deliver safety and security to customers by leveraging our high level of expertise, we are making various related efforts on top of the enhancement of the resolution capabilities of employees. In the following sections, we divide the process of claims services into five steps (receiving loss reports, initial response, loss adjustment, reporting progress and payment of insurance claims) and describe our efforts in each.
Receiving Loss Reports. 
Receiving a loss report from a customer is our first customer contact point in claims services. We work to eliminate anxieties held by a customer who just had an accident by asking whether or not he/ she was injured and what exactly happened and simultaneously giving considerate and appropriate advice.
Initial Response. 
After receiving a loss report, we confirm how the customer wishes to proceed with the accident response and provide a detailed description of the process from the beginning to the final resolution.
It is only after we consult with the customer that we will contact the parties and others concerned.
We try to relieve the customer’s anxiety by reporting back to him/her the results of contacting these parties.
Loss Adjustment. 
This step involves checking the status of a car or building damaged by the accident. At the same time, we scrutinize details of necessary repairs and estimated repair costs to confirm an adequate loss amount and explain it to the customer in an easy-to-understand manner.
Reporting Progress. 
To eliminate the customer’s anxiety and provide a higher sense of security, we make sure to report the progress in a manner and at the timing matched to the customer’s needs.
Payment of Insurance Claims. 
We calculate payable insurance claims and explain the details of these claims to the customer in an easy-to-understand manner. We then work to swiftly go through the payment procedures after confirming with the customer if he/she wants to file a claim. We also utilize a system to check for other applicable policies and inform the possible payment of other insurance claims, if any, to the customer. For auto insurance, in particular, we have in place a system that does not allow us to close * Re-examination Request System. 
A system for customers (including policyholders and insured persons) to request re- examination when they disagree with the decision not to pay insurance claims made by claims service bases in accordance with policy details.
When requested by a customer, the Claims Service Re-examination Committee, which is a closed-door committee composed of external specialists (doctors, lawyers and legal experts), re-examines the decision. The results are subsequently reported in written form to the customer who requested the re-examination. However, this system does not apply to cases that are outside the activity scope of the committee, which is to make a decision from a legal or medical viewpoint. For details, please contact the responsible claims service base.

Committee (in Japanese)
As one example, we have implemented the following operational improvements based on the evaluation results and opinions we gather through a customer survey, which is conducted after insurance claims are paid to policyholders of our auto insurance, who have been involved in an accident.
• Information regarding details of coverage and a list of available coverages (insurance claims) are sent to customers upon receipt of the notification of an accident, and personnel in charge provide information on the amount of claims payable in an easy-to-understand manner.
• When insurance claims are paid, personnel in charge will explain in an easy-to-understand manner while also sending a statement of claims payable that not only verifies the amount but also provides a detailed breakdown.
• When insurance claims cannot be paid, we inform customers of the reason both verbally and in written form in an easy-to-understand manner. Additionally, inquiries and claims from customers are accepted via an exclusive toll-free telephone line. Assistance from external specialists such as lawyers is also available via the Re-examination Request System*.

Shared Value for Caring for Customers as Our First Priority. 
Tokio Marine & Nichido believes that putting customers first and foremost translates into the quality of claims services, which are intangible and not readily perceivable. Accordingly, we distribute a booklet entitled Kokorokara (“From Our Hearts”) to all members engaged in claims services, including new employees who join the company each year. The booklet summarizes the values on which we place importance, including the shared ideas of all members involved with claims services for customers, working in harmony with colleagues and in pursuit of expertise. We hope to continuously hand down our purpose, pride and sincerity in claims services from a customer standpoint as part of our DNA.
• “Our ceaseless pursuit for expertise is really a quest for better human qualities, and this quest never ends.” • “Face to face with a person who needs your help, as a fellow human being, what does your heart tell you?
Everything starts from here. I want to help because a person needs my help. This strength of emotion is our raison d’etre.”

120 ■ Agent Trainee System. 
In April 2016, Tokio Marine & Nichido totally revamped its agent trainee system by shifting from targeting persons employed by. 
Tokio Marine & Nichido to a system for employees newly hired by corporate agents and temporarily assigned to the company.
It is a human resources development system that provides early-stage education, starting with the acquisition of knowledge on the policy renewal process of the corresponding agents, to facilitate the learning of solicitation skills. Under this system, agents’ new employees are temporarily transferred as trainees to Tokio Marine & Nichido for a maximum of two years to gain solicitation skills. The goal is to enable them to assume the role of a professional salesperson highly specialized in his or her area of expertise at the respective corporate agents. The program can also be utilized as a broader supportive measure to help agents grow, as it has expanded its scope to include part-time agents in the auto, real estate and financial fields. In April 2017, the company further upgraded this growth supportive measure by adding a system to pay an additional commission to the agent if its salesperson temporarily transferred to the company achieved a certain level of sales, as well as a training program to educate new graduate hires on business etiquette.
Nisshin Fire also operates the Risk Advisor Employee System, a similar trainee system to develop specialized professional agents. The system is designed to acquire various knowledge and practical work experience that are necessary for selling insurance while being engaged in soliciting contracts and related work for a certain period.
In order to meet customer expectations and earn their trust so that customers are able to consult us about insurance with peace of mind, we support the development of professional human resources through a qualifications system and training programs.

124 ■CO2 Emission Reduction Data (Energy Conservation and Reduction in Buildings, Facilities, etc.) ［Tokio Marine Holdings and Major Subsidiaries］ <CO2 Emission Reduction Target> • Medium-term target (fiscal 2020): -3% (compared with fiscal 2017 level) • Reduction target in fiscal 2018: -1% compared with previous year <CO2 Emissions (Tokio Marine Holdings and Major Subsidiaries)>
Fiscal 2018 CO2 emissions by Tokio Marine Group and its major subsidiaries (Scope 1 (direct emissions) + Scope 2 (indirect emissions) + Scope 3 (other indirect emissions) business travel only) were 111,509 tons (Japan: 77,511 tons, overseas: 33,999 tons) versus a start-of-year target of 114,091 tons (a 1% reduction year on year), or -3.2% (Japan: -3.7%, overseas: -2.0%) of emissions in the previous fiscal year.
As a result of efforts to steadily reduce CO2 emissions at Group companies in Japan and overseas, we succeeded in cutting these emissions beyond targets at the Group level. In addition, we have been expanding the coverage of the calculations for Scope 3 since fiscal 2015 in order to meet expectations from society in terms of initiatives to create environmental value by companies.
CSR Performance Data (CO2 emissions originating from energy sources and CO2 absorption and fixation(Tokio Marine Holdings and major subsidiaries) >> ［Tokio Marine & Nichido］ <CO2 Emission Reduction Target> • Medium-term target (fiscal 2020): -40% (compared with fiscal 2006 level) • Long-term target (fiscal 2050): -60% (compared with fiscal 2006 level) • Reduction target in fiscal 2019: -1% compared with previous year. 
Tokio Marine & Nichido, a core operating company of Tokio Marine Group, is striving to realize its medium-term target (fiscal 2020) by: (1) reducing energy in its main building and Shinkan building in. 
Marunouchi, Tokyo, and Tama building; (2) monitoring the increase and decrease in energy on a total site basis in line with site reconstruction and transfer plans; (3) implementing energy conservation campaigns in all branches; and (4) increasing energy conservation performance in company-owned cars.
In addition, Tokio Marine & Nichido will continue to make efforts to conserve energy in buildings, equipment and company-owned cars from 2021 toward the realization of its long-term target (fiscal 2050).
<CO2 Emissions (Fiscal 2018 Results)>
Fiscal 2018 CO2 emissions by Tokio Marine & Nichido (Scope 1 (direct emissions) + Scope 2 (indirect emissions) + Scope 3 (other indirect emissions) business travel only) were 59,664 tons versus a start- of-year target of 61,732 tons (a 1% reduction year on year), or -4.3% of emissions compared with the previous fiscal year. The main cause of this decrease was a reduction in power consumption owing to energy-saving initiatives.
Moreover, in order to meet the expectations of society regarding corporate efforts to create environmental value, we expanded the coverage of the calculations for Scope 3 in fiscal 2015.
CSR Performance Data (CO2 emissions originating from energy sources (Tokio Marine & Nichido)) >> ■Purchase of Tradable Green Power Certificates (Retirement of Emissions Credits)
Tokio Marine Group is promoting the use of natural energy in Japan and overseas.
Tokio Marine & Nichido has been purchasing Tradable Green Power Certificates in the amount of approximately 1 million kWh annually continuously since 2002 through wind power and biomass power generation. In addition, the Tradable Green Power Certificates purchased by the company are being allotted to the reduction of emissions at target sites based on the system regarding emissions 1. Reduce: Use energy-efficient buildings and facilities and cut back on energy usage.
2. Switch: Switch to natural energy.
3. Offset: Absorb and fix CO2 by mangrove planting and the retirement of emissions credits.
* Carbon neutral means that CO2 emitted in the course of a company’s business activities is equivalent to the volume of CO2 absorbed and reduced by way of mangrove planting, use of natural energy and the retirement of emissions credits by such a company.
The environmental footprint caused by business activities of Tokio Marine Group is relatively small compared with companies in the manufacturing industry; however, the size of the Group makes it a large consumer of energy. In order to reduce the environmental footprint from our business activities wherever possible, we have positioned initiatives for reducing the environmental footprint as a key issue for the company. The entire Tokio Marine Group, in Japan and overseas, is making efforts to become carbon* neutral under the following strategic concepts.

125 ■Initiatives toward Achieving Carbon Neutral Status through Mangrove Planting (CO2 Absorption through Mangroves)
Mangrove forests have an effect on the prevention and mitigation of global warming by absorbing and fixing a significant volume of CO2. Under the concept of “Insurance for the Future of the Earth,” Tokio Marine Group has engaged in the Mangrove Planting. 
Project since 1999. As of March 31, 2019, 10,930 hectares of mangrove forest have been planted through this project in nine countries, primarily in Asia.
Each Group company strives to reduce the environmental footprint through energy conservation and resource conservation. At the same time, Tokio Marine Group aims to achieve carbon neutral status on a global basis, offsetting the CO2 emissions generated by its business activities with CO2 fixation * Tokio Marine Holdings requested the Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI) to evaluate and calculate the amount of CO2 absorption and fixation through mangrove trees and received the evaluation report. Further, a third-party organization (Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC) has been requested to implement the agreed-upon procedures in compliance with Practical Guidelines in Specialized Fields 4400, Engagements to Perform Agreed-Upon Procedures (The Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants) for part of the data used in the report. As a result, Tokio Marine Group has deemed that the effects of CO2 absorption and fixation through mangrove planting have been calculated properly. * The coverage of calculations for Scope 3 (other indirect emissions) was expanded in fiscal 2015.
Scope 1 Direct. 
Scope 2 Indirect. 
Scope 3 Other.

CO 2 fxation and reduction 153,335 tons CO2 emissions 111,509 tons. 
Business travel and others 29,300 tons ■Raising Employees’ Energy Conservation Awareness. 
Responding to the calls for energy conservation (in particular, the restraint of electricity consumption during peak periods) following the Great East Japan Earthquake of March 2011, Group companies in Japan are implementing Summer & Winter Electricity-Saving Measures as an initiative to firmly establish electricity and energy conservation. Specifically, the companies are making continuous efforts to (1) conserve energy in offices (reducing unneeded light fixtures, placing restrictions on use of items (OA equipment, copiers, etc.) around power outlets and thoroughly managing air conditioning (such as setting temperatures in offices to 28°C in summer and 19°C in winter); and (2) review employees’ work styles (such as encouraging early morning working hours and promoting casual dress). Further, we are making efforts to curb CO2 emissions from energy usage, such as by expanding our use of TV/Web conferencing systems and restricting air travel for business (which also reduces costs).
In addition, Tokio Marine & Nichido endorses COOL CHOICE, a national campaign that encourages all “smart choices” that contribute to countermeasures for global warming, including for Japan’s energy- saving and low-carbon products, services and behavior in order to attain the Japanese government’s target of a 26% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with fiscal 2013. We are promoting activities to realize a low-carbon society.

126 ■ Initiatives to Reduce Paper Use. 
Tokio Marine Group’s volume of paper consumed in fiscal 2018 was 8,068 tons (Japan: 7,355 tons, overseas: 713 tons), which marked a decrease of 5.2% on a year-on-year basis (down 2.4% in Japan and down 26.6% overseas) thanks to reduction efforts in and outside Japan. In fiscal 2019, we are taking action under a target of reducing paper volume in Japan by 1% from the previous fiscal year.
As a measure to curb paper consumption, Group companies are distributing mobile terminals (tablets, PCs) to employees as a measure to reform working styles while reducing paper consumption, along with promoting the paperless Raku Raku Tetsuzuki (Quick and Easy Online Procedures) when applying for insurance on their tablet or other device, the use of paperless conferencing, using green procurement of stationery and office supplies, shifting forms and pamphlets to Web formats (i.e., promoting paperless use) and firmly establishing the use of double-sided copying and aggregate printing.
■ Initiatives for Reducing the Environmental Footprint in the Value Chain <Promoting Eco-Safe Driving and the use of recycled auto parts>
From the perspective of creating a recycling-based society and reducing the burden on the environment (i.e., curbing CO2 emissions from the manufacture of parts*), Tokio Marine Group is calling on employees to engage in the Eco-Safe Driving program of The General Insurance Association of Japan and is actively using recycled auto parts when repairing vehicles used by Group companies.
Furthermore, Tokio Marine & Nichido, Nisshin Fire & Marine Insurance and E. design Insurance are taking action in calling for the use of recycled auto parts and proposing the use of these parts to individual and corporate customers that have met with accidents.
• Number of instances of use of recycled auto parts (fiscal 2018, Tokio Marine & Nichido) : about 20,969 (+14.8% compared with the previous year)
With the approval of customers, Tokio Marine & Nichido is making efforts to expand the use of recycled parts. The company’s actions include distributing pamphlets to boost awareness of the. 
Recycled Parts Usage Promotion Campaign among agents and auto repair shops, as well as creating content for tablet devices to aid these businesses in easily explaining the merits of recycled parts to customers.
<Effective Use of TV/Web conferencing>
By making effective use of TV/Web conferencing, Tokio Marine & Nichido is reducing greenhouse gases resulting from employee business travel and is striving to raise business processing efficiency. Tokio Marine & Nichido has presently introduced and is actively utilizing more than 300 teleconferencing systems at its business bases, and by doing so, is limiting the number of employee business trips and reducing business travel expenses.
■Resource Conservation in Buildings and Facilities. 
Tokio Marine Group’s companies are engaged in initiatives* that consider the environment and disaster prevention in buildings and facilities, as appropriate for each structure.
• Facilities investment value related to energy conservation measures: 588 million yen (fiscal 2018,
Tokio Marine & Nichido) * Upgrading to boilers, high-efficiency lighting fixtures (LED, etc.) and air conditioning, etc.
At Tokio Marine & Nichido, the company’s Nagoya Tokio Marine & Nichido Building, which was completed in 2013, gives high consideration to the environment with features that include double- glazed window glass and LED lighting throughout the entire building. This building has earned the. 
S-rank, the highest rank under the Comprehensive Assessment System for Building Environmental. 
Efficiency (CASBEE) Nagoya, a building environmental performance evaluation system operated by. 
Nagoya City.
This building has secured the top-tier Platinum ranking under the DBJ Green Building Certification. 
System operated jointly by the Development Bank of Japan and Japan Real Estate Institute.
Furthermore, in January 2015 Tokio Marine & Nichido was certified as an excellent Eco-Oriented. 
Business by Nagoya City due to voluntary and proactive efforts to be kind to the environment in its business activities. It also won the 22nd Aichi Machinami Architecture Award in recognition of its contribution to the formation of a pleasant local environment, and in December 2015 won. 
Outstanding Performance Award for Eco-Oriented Businesses certified by Nagoya City.
In addition, Tokio Marine & Nichido was recognized by Osaka Prefecture for initiatives and achievements in reducing greenhouse gases in offices and won the Excellence Award in the Osaka. 
Stop Global Warming Awards.
At Group companies overseas, as in Japan, we are taking measures to conserve energy as appropriate for each building or facility. As an example, Tokio Marine Centre (Singapore) has been actively introducing environmentally conscious measures that include the installation of energy-saving air- conditioning equipment and lighting fixtures, installation of water-saving equipment that reuses rainwater and placement of greenery.

129 ■Tokio Marine Group Wellness Charter. 
In order to instill Tokio Marine Group’s vision of and thinking behind health and productivity management throughout Group companies in and outside Japan, we have formulated the Tokio. 
Marine Group Wellness Charter as health-related guidelines for employees. As we plan to disseminate the charter to Group companies overseas, we created both Japanese and English versions.
<Declaration of Health and Productivity Management>
Tokio Marine & Nichido, a major Tokio Marine Group company, is promoting an array of initiatives under its Declaration of Health and Productivity Management, which states that employees represent the most important driving force in becoming and continuing to grow as a “Good Company” chosen by customers, and that Tokio Marine & Nichido proactively seeks to maintain and promote the physical and mental health of employees and their families.
■Promotion Structure. 
Overseen by the Group CEO, our efforts to promote health and productivity management are led by the Group Chief Wellness Officer (CWO), who is also the Group Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO), and the Wellness Promotion Team set up within Tokio Marine Holdings. We are also making collaborative health promotion efforts jointly with the Health Insurance Association.
Additionally, with the aim of extending efforts to ensure employee health to all employees working across Japan, Tokio Marine & Nichido has established a system of collaboration between industrial health staff stationed at 46 locations nationwide and key persons appointed in each workplace respectively for human resources skills development and health promotion. Using this Tokio Marine &
Nichido’s effort as a benchmark, we are implementing a similar system in other Group companies in a phased manner.
■ Legal Compliance. 
The Industrial Safety and Health Act, Health Promotion Act and other relevant laws and regulations form the basis of all our initiatives in this area. We comply with these laws and regulations in every aspect, from conducting periodic health checkups and stress checks to protecting personal information.
Each Group company has established an industrial safety and health management framework in accordance with the Industrial Safety and Health Act to fulfill its obligation to ensure the appropriate consideration of safety. Specifically, Group companies appoint an industrial physician and health officer and set up a health committee at each domestic business site with more than 50 employees.
The committee, composed of an industrial physician, health officer, persons in charge of health management and persons selected from the employee labor union, meets once per month to deliberate on measures for physical and mental health maintenance and promotion and improving the workplace environment as well as measures for preventing health disorders, including those resulting from overwork.

For its efforts to ensure employee health, as described in the Tokio Marine Group’s Health and. 
Productivity Management Vision, Tokio Marine & Nichido has defined four priority areas based on “Data Health” plans created in collaboration with the Health Insurance Association as well as the results of analysis of health checkup and various other health-related data.
<Enhancement of Health Literacy>
We regard health literacy as a basis of health actions. We work to raise the level of health literacy among employees so that they become mindful of their own health and that of people around them, willingly learn about health measures and voluntarily make health promotion efforts.
<Health Maintenance and Promotion>
We believe ongoing efforts by employees themselves are essential in maintaining and promoting their health. We strive to enhance the health of all employees by implementing measures to support their efforts, providing necessary tools and encouraging individual and organizational efforts.
<Prevention of Lifestyle-Related Diseases>
A lifestyle-related disease is a health issue that greatly affects both the current life of an employee and his or her life after retirement. As an effort to prevent the onset and aggravation of lifestyle- related diseases, we proactively provide support by industrial health staff (industrial physicians and nursing staff) as necessary based on the results of health checkups.
<Realization of a Better Working Life>
In order to ensure the physical and mental health of employees, we need to pay attention not only to the health status of individuals but also to factors affecting it, such as the workplace environment and their attitude toward work. We implement mental health measures led by supervisors in each workplace and industrial health staff and help employees balance work with medical treatment so as to enable them to work with vitality and with a higher level of work engagement and lead a fulfilling life.
■ Examples of Major Health Measures <“Get Healthier” Initiative> 【Applicable priority areas】
Enhancement of health literacy; Health maintenance and promotion 【Details】
This is an all-participation health promotion initiative designed to enable all employees to maintain and promote their health. As part of this initiative, we have been holding the Health Promotion. 
Months campaign in every October and November for 29 years. We have also been working to increase the rate of participation by making adjustments to how we conduct the initiative.
Adjustments to date include providing a menu of activities (“Our Challenge” program) to support workplace efforts, appointing key persons in each workplace, introducing a web-based version and establishing a President’s Award program.
In addition, we have been evaluating our health measures by analyzing the improvement status of employee health, stress levels and lifestyle habits as well as effects on productivity and work engagement. As a result, we have confirmed that offices and branches participating in the “Our. 
Challenge” program show lower productivity loss (or loss resulting from presenteeism). Accordingly, we will continue to undertake the initiative while striving to increase the participation rate.
【Applicable priority areas】
Prevention of lifestyle-related diseases 【Details】
We determine how and to whom we provide support using blood pressure and blood sugar level indicators as selection criteria. We conduct an interview by an industrial physician with all applicable employees and encourage appropriate medical treatment and behavior change by recommending medical consultation, collaborating with their primary doctors and providing health guidance by nursing staff. We follow through until there is an improvement in their data. As a result of these efforts, over 70% of the applicable employees have shown lower blood pressures.
Moreover, the results of multi-year analysis on health checkup data revealed that 50% of employees showing high blood pressure (levels II and III in some guidelines) did not apply to these levels in the previous year. To prevent aggravation and suppress an increase in the number of employees developing higher blood pressures, our nursing staff members are providing health guidance and disseminating related information via e-mail to employees with level-I high blood pressure.

131 <Anti-Obesity Program for Younger Employees> <Mental Health Care> <Health Support for Women> <Creating a Comfortable Workplace Environment> <Provision of a Healthy and Nutritionally Balanced Lunch Menus at Head Office Employee Cafeteria> 【Applicable priority areas】
Prevention of lifestyle-related diseases 【Details】
This is a three-month program to help younger employees (below the age of 40 and showing a body-mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher), who have tendency toward obesity, to reduce weight to a desirable level. Over the course of the program, participants work to change their lifestyle habits, including diet and physical exercise, to reduce weight and counter metabolic syndrome. Some 90% of the participants have completed the program, while about 70% have lost weight. The rate of obesity among younger employees has also been on the decrease. Another confirmed outcome is that the participants show lower risks of high blood pressures, fats and blood sugar levels and better eating habits than non-participants.
Additionally, we have found that, among employees who have shown improved neutral fat levels or eating habits, the ratio of those showing higher productivity (or lower presenteeism) is meaningfully high. The implication is that better lifestyle habits are linked to weight loss and higher productivity. We will continue to implement the program while verifying its positive effects.
【Applicable priority areas】
Realization of a better working life 【Details】
Each Tokio Marine Group company actively promotes mental health measures as we recognize the importance of pursuing the maintenance and improvement of employees’ mental health in terms of corporate management. Specific efforts include setting up a mental health counseling desk and using stress checks to promote self-care and analyze issues at an organizational level in order to maintain a good workplace environment.
Tokio Marine & Nichido has established the Basic Policy on Mental Health Measures. Under this policy, supervisors at the workplace and industrial health staff collaborate to proactively implement various measures. These include efforts to maintain sound mental health, measures to encourage early detection and treatment as well as measures to care for employees with mental health issues.
Since 2012, the company has also been making efforts to spread the concept of work engagement, which is considered a primordial prevention measure for mental illnesses. As we have confirmed through analysis a link between worsening mental health and absenteeism, we will continue to implement the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle and help employees work with enthusiasm.
【Applicable priority areas】
Health maintenance and promotion; Enhancement of health literacy 【Details】
Our measures to support the health of female employees include holding seminars and providing a variety of information. Seminars by outside lecturers specialized in health management of working women have been held with the participation of all employees via our corporate satellite network (CSN). Regarding the examples of providing a variety of information, we send internal notifications, individual notices of an upcoming health checkup and e-mails as a means to encourage female employees to receive examinations for uterine and breast cancers. In an effort to increase their motivation to receive the screening, we include in these notices various data, such as the prevalence and mortality of these cancers; the cure rate following early detection; screening rate by age group; and Q&As about cancer examinations.
With a view to enhancing employees’ literacy for health disorders specific to women, we provide health newsletters specialized in health maintenance and promotion for women. By sending these newsletters and other related information to both female and male employees, we intend to communicate and facilitate an understanding of our health support measures for female employees in the hope that they provide an opportunity for male employees to think about the health of women around them, including families and colleagues.
【Applicable priority areas】
Realization of a better working life 【Details】
Tokio Marine Group is not only satisfying various standards stipulated under laws and regulations related to the workplace environment but also promoting the creation of a comfortable workplace environment that takes into consideration lighting, noise, ventilation, temperature, humidity and other ergonomic aspects.

132 ■Evaluation and Improvement of Health and Productivity Management Initiatives (PDCA)
Tokio Marine & Nichido evaluates and strives to improve its health and productivity management initiatives mainly in the four priority areas. Efforts are made to get an idea of conditions company- wide, which includes the rate of anomalies in medical examinations, rate of obesity, incidence of lifestyle-related diseases, rate of people having disease risk resulting from not doing regular exercise, consultation rate for cancer screening, smoking rate and the results of stress checks. These data are reviewed and analyzed for identifying required tasks in specific terms. Tokio Marine & Nichido has also defined key performance indicators (KPIs) and targets to achieve these tasks.
Targets in the area of health maintenance and promotion include lowering the smoking rate, increasing the consultation rate for screening of female-specific cancers and increasing the rate of participation in Health Promotion Months. We monitor the KPIs each year, verify the effectiveness of our initiatives and work for improvement while rotating the PDCA cycle.
Toward realizing Tokio Marine Group’s health and productivity management vision, which serves as a framework to evaluate our initiatives to enhance our corporate value in a sustainable manner, we continuously verify our multi-faceted KPIs to assess the impact on the organization and impact on external evaluation.
<KPIs and Example Verification Results>
Health issues change constantly in line with changes in the social environment and accompanying changes in the workplace environment. In recent years, in response to a reform of work styles of women, we have been providing finely tuned support to health-related issues specific to women by leveraging our workplace-based industrial health system.
In the future as well, we will anticipate an impact of these changes on employee health and support work styles with higher productivity from the health aspect by preventing health issues from becoming prevalent.

Tokio Marine Group aims to enhance employee satisfaction and motivation through a fair personnel system and management. The Group also endeavors to realize a corporate culture in which all employees respect human rights through various initiatives such as human rights training.
■Enhancing Productivity and Corporate Value. 
Tokio Marine Group works to enhance employees’ job satisfaction and motivation mainly through a fair personnel system. Moreover, we respond to changes in the environment and ensure appropriate management of personnel and labor risks. Through these initiatives, we strive to increase productivity and corporate value.
The environment surrounding Tokio Marine Group, in particular, has been undergoing rapid changes, including technological advancements, globalization and demographic shifts. Consequently, it has become increasingly important to accurately capture these highly uncertain changes in the external environment and reflect them in corporate management. As a system to stably secure management personnel with high levels of expertise and management capability to respond to such significant changes on a global basis, Tokio Marine Holdings introduced a new personnel system in April 2019.
CSR Performance Data (Number of employees, basic employee data, etc.) >> ■Raising Employee Satisfaction Levels. 
Tokio Marine Group has created a group-wide platform for the implementation of a Group employee attitude survey once each year. In fiscal 2018, the survey was given to 5,158 employees in 16 companies with individual companies such as Tokio Marine & Nichido and Tokio Marine & Nichido.

Tokio Marine Group Spirit has been built up by overcoming numerous adversities and constantly taking on challenges since our earliest days that focus on the five areas of taking on challenges, openness and dynamism, customer orientation, social contribution (contribute to society and people) and a global perspective. This spirit has been passed down over the generations and even now is the starting point for individual ideas and the source of human resources with a high sense of purpose who boldly take on challenges. In addition, based on the Tokio Marine Group Spirit, we have fostered over many years a nurturing culture in which both the person doing the guiding and the person being guided grow and develop. We are working to spread and pass down this nurturing culture to the entire Group with the aim of having our Group companies around the world work together on the development of human resources.
■Aiming to be the Most Successful Company in Japan Where People Can Grow and Develop. 
For Tokio Marine Group, people and the trust built up by those people are the source of all our competitiveness, and thus human resources development is an extremely important theme. Each. 
Tokio Marine Group company is building skill development programs and personnel systems appropriate for the characteristics of their respective businesses based on the Tokio Marine Group. 
Spirit. As an example, Tokio Marine & Nichido aims to be the most successful company in Japan where people can grow and develop in order to become a company which provides customers with a sense of security, is selected by customers and constantly grows, as stated in its mid-term business plan. We are also creating a framework within our corporate systems that supports self-help in order to meet the idea that each employee has the desire to grow.
Specifically, Tokio Marine & Nichido regularly conducts interviews between supervisors and their subordinates so that each employee can realize his or her own career vision. In the interviews, employees share what they want to become and their strengths and weaknesses, and challenging roles are assigned that lead to the growth of respective subordinates. The year-round dialogue between supervisors and subordinates concerning on-the-job training (OJT), off-the-job training (Off-JT) and planned self-development efforts seeks to enhance each employee’s competencies (in behavior and thinking).

136 ■ Empowering Female Employees. 
Tokio Marine Group regards the promotion of diversity and inclusion is synonymous with its growth strategy, and the Group CEO has been stressing the importance of such efforts at various meetings and seminars via a top management message. With the Diversity & Inclusion Promotion Team established within the. 
Human Resources Department taking the lead, we are also accelerating our initiatives to promote the active engagement of female employees. At Tokio Marine Group consolidated companies in. 
Japan, we aim to provide customers with products and services that achieve even greater customer satisfaction by further empowering and promoting the growth of female employees in keeping with the Group’s Corporate Philosophy. For this purpose, we provide a variety of opportunities to every female employee at each Group company for autonomously building their careers and empowering them in an even wider range of fields. For instance, an association of Group companies in Japan holds seminars on promoting female empowerment and Majikira discussions (a venue for discussing serious topics in an open, frank and creative manner) for female employees in different occupations and work environments. Participants get an insight into diverse values and philosophies, providing the opportunity to think about and increase awareness of their own careers.
Tokio Marine Holdings was selected as a “Nadeshiko Brand” in fiscal 2018, the fourth time following fiscal 2013, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2017, in recognition of group-wide efforts to empower women and performance in terms of results. Further, the president announced his advocacy of a declaration of action stating that a group of male leaders dedicated to empowering women would accelerate the active participation of women who shine as well as the vision of the 30% Club Japan established in. 
May 2019.
Tokio Marine & Nichido Career Service and Tokio Marine & Nichido Risk Consulting were granted “Eruboshi” certification by the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare in April 2016 and January 2017, respectively, as outstanding companies in terms of conditions related to promoting the active participation of women. The certification has three stages depending on the number of assessment items fulfilled and both companies received the top certification.
Goals and Specific Measures for Empowering Female Employees. 
In seeking to achieve a state in which women commonly participate in every decision-making process, Tokio Marine & Nichido has set the target of increasing the ratio of female employees in sub- ■ Promoting Diversity and Inclusion. 
Based on the Tokio Marine Group Corporate Philosophy of “Tokio Marine Group will continue to build an open and dynamic corporate culture that enables each and every employee to demonstrate his or her creative potential,” every company in the Group respects human rights and encourages diversity in gender, age, nationality and other aspects. The Group also welcomes individuals with diverse values to bring them together to achieve even greater results.
As an example of accomplishments in promoting diversity, Tokio Marine & Nichido earned the. 
Diversity Management Selection 100, an award sponsored by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and. 
Industry (METI). For this award, METI selects and commends “companies that have raised corporate value through diversity-oriented management.” Tokio Marine & Nichido earned this award based on high regard for its efforts such as enabling numerous women to continually take active roles by helping protect motherhood, enhancing systems for supporting child rearing and transforming the overall roles of employees, and for promoting the employment of persons with disabilities while raising consciousness of the principle of normalization.
As a recent example, we held the TOKIO MARINE GROUP DIVERSITY FORUM in November 2017 and again in November 2018 with the theme “unconscious bias” aimed at fostering a corporate culture that can draw out the potential of diverse personnel to the greatest extent possible and further promoting diversity and inclusion. Some 120 people took part in the forum from Tokio Marine Group companies. Going forward, Tokio Marine Group will continue to implement various initiatives that lead to diversity and inclusion promotion.

137 ■ Promoting Active Roles for Older Employees. 
Tokio Marine Group considers actively promoting the continued employment of older members to be an important management issue in maintaining the sustainable growth of the Group as a whole. In addition to encouraging continuous self-advancement and changes in consciousness and behavior on the part of employees themselves, the Group intends to provide fields of activity in which employees can utilize their past experience and strengths to generate new added value while maintaining high levels of motivation.
■ Promotion of Global Human Resources Strategy. 
Amid the increasing importance of overseas business, Tokio Marine Group considers it essential to build a human resources base that supports development into a global insurance group through the hiring and developing of diverse human resources at Group companies around the world. To achieve this goal, we formulated a global human resources strategy and have been promoting various measures on an ongoing basis since 2012.
Pillars of Tokio Marine Group Global Human Resources Strategy (1) Develop Global Leaders (2) Develop highly professional human resources for each function in line with expertise (3) Expand the base of the global talent pool (4) Establish systems and infrastructure to spread the Company’s Corporate Philosophy. 
For “Develop Global Leaders,” we are implementing a number of measures aimed at development that include training for Global Leader candidates selected from Group companies worldwide. In addition,
Tokio Marine Group started the Global Job Rotation Program in fiscal 2011 from the perspective of actively utilizing motivated and capable overseas local talent. These and other initiatives are being undertaken to develop and utilize highly professional human resources for each function in line with expertise.
The Group also provides a variety of development opportunities with the aim of broadening the horizons of this group of global human resources. This includes short-term overseas training programs for Global Course third-year employees of Tokio Marine & Nichido, which started in fiscal 2012, and the dispatch of overseas trainees.
A specialized department to take charge of global human resources was established at Tokio Marine. 
Holdings to steadily promote this initiative. At the same time, the Company regularly holds the manager positions (chief or higher positions) to more than 50% in its action plan formulated pursuant to the Act on the Promotion of Female Participation and Career Advancement in the Workplace.
As specific efforts, Tokio Marine & Nichido has incorporated “promotion of female empowerment” as a theme in management-level training and included the creation of an organization in which diverse human resources can play active roles as an assessment item of the Role Challenge System (internal assessment system). In 2015, we became a member of the IkuBoss Alliance, and through IkuBoss seminars, we continue to raise awareness.
As for the development of female employees, Tokio Marine & Nichido, with its fundamental three- pronged approach of setting expectations, conducting training and providing opportunities, assigns female employees responsibilities based on their individual career visions, provides year-round OJT, implements job rotation between departments and offers selection-based training programs such as an area course career plan training program, thereby creating an environment that allows women to take on challenges according to their willingness and abilities.
Results of Activities to Promote Active Roles for Female Employees. 
As a result of these initiatives, the number of women in management-level positions (excluding executive officer) rose from eight in 2004 to 258 in 2019 at Tokio Marine & Nichido, marking approximately a 30-fold increase. There are also a large number of women taking on active roles as managers on the frontline of sales and claims services. The company will continue to promote such efforts and expects the female manager rate to be more than 30% in 2030.
A strong push is also being made to appoint women to executive positions. At Tokio Marine &
Nichido, there are three female directors as of 2019 (including one managing director). Other Group companies in Japan already have about 10 women in executive positions. In addition, one of the four.

■Promoting the Employment of Persons with Disabilities. 
Aiming to broadly accept persons with disabilities and to become a corporate group in which diverse personnel work enthusiastically, Tokio Marine Group is promoting the employment of persons with disabilities at Group companies and working to raise consciousness of normalization. Tokio. 
Marine Business Support Co., Ltd., a special subsidiary based on the Disabled Persons Employment. 
Promotion Law, is supporting Group development by providing services that include administrative support, printing and logistics.
Promoting the Employment of Persons with Disabilities through a Special Subsidiary. 
In January 2010, we established Tokio Marine Business Support with the aim of promoting the employment of persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities, and in March 2010, the company was the first in the non-life insurance industry to be approved as a special subsidiary under the Disabled Persons Employment Promotion Law (328 employees as of June 1, 2019).
A total of 183 employees with disabilities (as of June 1, 2019), mainly persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities who are considered to have fewer employment opportunities among persons with disabilities, are working at the Tokyo head office and at the Nagoya, Osaka and Kyushu branch offices. These employees are supporting Group companies by performing such operations as data input and processing, document enclosure and shipping and printing. In the collection and destruction of confidential documents, one of its operations, the company has introduced a wet-type shredder that dissolves paper with water rather than by cutting, and by doing so, is simultaneously assuring information security and protecting the environment.
Further, employees with disabilities started selling coffee as part of a welfare program to Tokio Marine & Nichido employees in 2017. Marking the second year of activity in 2018, the company has increased the number of cafés to broaden the field of activities for persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Based on its corporate philosophy to 1) be an organization that provides support instead of being a support recipient, 2) be a company in which employees can have their dreams and take pride in and 3) expand opportunities for taking active roles, the company is focusing on creating an environment in which employees can work enthusiastically with a sense of satisfaction. It also intends to become a company in which everyone can grow through work while keeping a sense of gratitude and remaining considerate to others.

Tokio Marine Business Support (in Japanese)
Aiming to be a Company in Which All People Respect and Support Each Other. 
Tokio Marine & Nichido Systems has actively been seeking to promote normalization for persons with disabilities by making areas barrier free, hiring physically challenged persons as IT engineers and having visually impaired persons provide in-house massage services.
From September 2009, the company has been running the internal café, Smile Café, and Smile Office Service, which provides general administrative services such as producing name cards and making printouts through persons with intellectual disabilities. Smile Café is used by around 400 people every day and is a place where employees can relax. It also sells bread and sweets made at a nearby welfare facility. Smile Office Service is expanding the types of work it handles every year and has gained the trust of employees.
By having general employees and persons with disabilities work together, synergetic effects are being created in terms of cheering up each other and enhancing work satisfaction.

Tokio Marine Group has been striving to reform working styles with the aim of driving sustainable growth of the company and employees by having diverse human resources work with high productivity.
■ Initiatives in Pursuit of Highly Productive Working Styles. 
Tokio Marine Group is pushing ahead with various initiatives in pursuit of highly productive working styles in order to provide even higher added value to customers.
As examples, Tokio Marine & Nichido and Tokio Marine & Nichido Life initiated Go Go Challenge. 
Day (employees finish work at 5:30 p.m. once per week) and Season Challenge (all lights off and employees finish work at 8:00 p.m. for one month four times a year) so as to establish the custom of each employee controlling his or her own work hours independently. In doing so, the company aims for all employees to carry out these working practices.
In addition, we allow the use of a dedicated app that enables the confirmation, sending and receiving of company email from the individual’s mobile handset when on the move or with a client. From an infrastructure perspective, we provide company mobile handsets depending on the nature of the work, and from a system perspective, home and mobile working are given as options to all employees. We aim to ensure that diverse personnel can work at high productivity levels by establishing an environment in which people are free to choose work location and work times.
By encouraging each employee to effectively utilize the extra time created through these initiatives for personal growth (higher motivation to work, better health and enriched life) and linking their personal growth to higher added value we provide to customers, we aim to achieve sustainable growth of both the Group and employees.
CSR Performance Data (Annual average actual working hours, number of thin-client terminal users) >> 4. Reform of Working Styles ■Personnel Systems Enabling Diverse Employees to Work with Independence. 
To support the realization of diverse working styles for each employee, Tokio Marine Group companies have established a range of systems including the introduction of a system enabling employees to flexibly change daily working hours (working hours free choice system) as well as childcare and nursing care leave, volunteer work leave and special consecutive paid holidays. In particular, Tokio Marine & Nichido aims for 100% of employees to take special consecutive paid holidays, which allows them to take five consecutive days off for any reasons. In addition, the working hours free choice system is being utilized by at least 10% of all of our employees on a single month basis.
Through these systems, each employee has the ability to choose the best working style to fit the circumstances he or she has been placed in. This has enabled us to create an environment in which employees with diverse values and a variety of experiences, including childcare and nursing care, can continue to make a meaningful contribution. In addition, we give consideration to flexible working arrangements through I-turn transfers*, Tokio Marine & Nichido’s job request system.
