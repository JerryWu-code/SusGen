3 THE COCA‑COLA COMPANY / 2019 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT. 
JAMES QUINCEY. 
CHAIRMAN & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER come. And we’re on track to meet our goal of empowering 5 million women by the end of 2020 as well as continuing to replenish annually more than 100% of the water used to manufacture our beverages.
LOVED BRANDS. 
Our foundation for enduring success is that we are a total beverage company. We’re present in almost every beverage category, and we have more than 500 brands. Over 700,000 people in our global system help deliver those brands to customers and consumers every day.
• In 2019, we continued to execute our growth strategy, which led to strong revenue and profit growth for the year, along with gaining value share in 85% of our key markets.
• Trademark Coca-Cola grew retail value 6% for the second consecutive year, supported by contributions from innovations such as Coca-Cola with Coffee, which was launched in 35 additional markets in 2019.
• We introduced Coca-Cola Energy in more than 45 markets, and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar continued to see double-digit volume growth globally.
• We completed the acquisition of Costa Coffee and acquired full ownership of C.H.I. Limited, an innovative, fast-growing leader in expanding beverage categories, including juices, value-added dairy and iced tea in West Africa.
• In January 2020, we acquired full ownership of fairlife. Value-added dairy products have been one of the fastestgrowing categories in the United States, with fairlife being a large contributor to sales growth.
In 1923, Robert W. Woodruff became president of The Coca-Cola Company. Woodruff was just 33 at the time, and Coca-Cola was still a small company with an uncertain future.
Woodruff went on to help lead the company for decades—decades filled with tremendous progress and transformation. He also navigated the company through many difficult chapters, while staying true to the purpose of The Coca-Cola Company: to refresh the world and make a difference.
Today, we face our own challenges. In 2020, there has been an unprecedented global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus COVID-19. Although the circumstances may be different, our company’s purpose remains the same. It’s why we exist, and it’s needed now, more than ever.
Coca-Cola has a history of leadership, of resilience, and of doing the right thing. No matter whether times are good or when challenges exist.
Just as our purpose guides us in difficult times, it guides our vision for growth in better times. In 2019, we laid out our vision to craft the brands and choice of drinks that people love, to refresh them in body and spirit. And we said we’ll do this in ways that create a more sustainable business and better shared future that makes a difference in people’s lives, communities and our planet.
We delivered strong revenue and profit growth in 2019. Globally, our zero sugar products continued to perform extremely well. We made significant progress toward our World Without Waste goals, with 16 markets offering beverages packaged in 100% recycled PET bottles, with more to. 
DONE SUSTAINABLY. 
We know it’s our responsibility to use our global scale for good. We’re using our leadership to achieve positive change in the world and build a more sustainable future for our communities and our planet. We’re doing this by taking a hard look at data and setting goals for our company based in science.
• In 2019, we provided consumers more beverage choices with less sugar. We continue work to reduce package sizes and provide clear nutrition information. We removed approximately 350,000 tons of added sugar on an annualized basis through approximately 275 product reformulations in 2019.
• We are making significant progress in our World Without Waste initiative. We now have 16 markets offering beverages packaged in 100% recycled PET bottles, with more to come. Coca-Cola Sweden announced it would be the first market in the world to transition to 100% recycled PET for all plastic bottles made in-country.
• We made key investments, including in a cutting-edge bottle-to-bottle recycling facility in the Philippines and, in the United States, we teamed with industry partners and major competitors to launch the “Every Bottle Back” program. This includes a new $100 million industry fund that will be used to improve sorting, processing and collection in areas with the biggest infrastructure gaps to help increase the amount of recycled plastic available to be remade into new beverage bottles.
• We set a new, Science-Based Target, aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. By 2030, we aim to reduce total GHG emissions across our full value chain by 25% below 2015 levels.

4 THE COCA‑COLA COMPANY / 2019 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT. 
OUR RESPONSE TO THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. 
The Coca-Cola Company has—and always will—put the health, safety and security of people first. Our approach is grounded in our company’s purpose, which ensures that we continuously strive to make a difference for people in our communities and in our workplaces.
The coronavirus pandemic has posed enormous challenges around the world. Our company’s deepest sympathies go out to all who have been impacted. Even in challenging times, our company’s 134-year history shows us one thing: We have faced crises before, and we always emerge stronger, more resilient and more united than ever.
For more about our company’s actions during the pandemic, please visit our website.
FOR A BETTER SHARED FUTURE. 
We continue to provide assistance and support to the communities we serve, especially in times of need.
• In 2019, we contributed nearly $125 million ($88 million from The Coca-Cola Foundation and $37 million from The Coca-Cola Company) to directly benefit 294 organizations across 129 countries and territories.
• Our economic empowerment programs have been making a meaningful difference. We have empowered more than 4.6 million women and our 5by20 initiative is on track to reach its target of transforming the lives of 5 million women by the end of 2020.
• Diversity and inclusion are at the heart of our values and continue to play an important part in our company’s success. To emphasize our commitment to gender diversity, Coca-Cola joined several global and national pledges, including Catalyst CEO Champions for Change, Leading Executives Advancing Diversity (LEAD) Network, United Nations Women and the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion.
Finally, this is the second year for our combined Business and Sustainability. 
Report. We are committed to doing business the right way, and this combined approach helps us drive collective accountability and increased transparency into our data and processes.
In 2019, we had a successful year. In looking back, writing today during a challenging period in 2020, I’m reminded of the power of our people to make a difference, to serve our communities and to constantly work to shape a more sustainable business. The leaders before us showed the way, in their examples of perseverance and resolve. We’ll continue to work toward building a better future. And I thank you for your support and partnership along the way.

THE COCA‑COLA COMPANY / 2019 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 6. 
Our publicly reported 2020 sustainability goals drive us to continually improve, working in concert with The Coca-Cola Company’s approximately 225 bottling partners in more than 200 countries and territories. We are looking beyond 2020 for our priority issues, developing new and more ambitious plans, such as our packaging goals that span to 2025 and our new 2030 climate goal.
OUR PRIORITIES & PROGRESS. 
CLIMATE. 
We set our “drink in your hand” goal in 2013 to include our full value chain in our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction efforts. We have cut our carbon footprint by 24% toward our 2020 target of 25% reduction against a 2010 baseline. Since setting that goal, we have recognized the need for even more ambitious climate action. In 2019, we published a Science-Based Target1 for the Coca-Cola system. This metric represents the share of carbon we need to reduce as a company to help keep global climate change safely below the 2-degree threshold aligned with the Paris Agreement targets.
READ MORE: Climate. 
REDUCING ADDED SUGAR. 
Leading health authorities have recommended that individuals should not consume more than 10% of their total calories from added sugar. We’ve embraced this recommendation, providing choices that support what consumers want and need. We have been aggressively changing recipes to reduce added sugar, promoting low- and no-calorie beverage options, and making smaller packages more available to enable portion control. We have also been expanding our range of beverages—including water, coffee, tea, dairy, fruit juices and plant-based options—and developing the next generation of sugar alternatives.
We are tracking the results of these efforts, and the majority of the added sugar reductions stem from changes to our sparkling beverage recipes and packaging size reductions.
READ MORE: Our�Portfolio/Reducing� Added�Sugar. 
Reducing added sugar while increasing sales globally 2018 2019 –1.7% –4.0%
Sugar - vertical 1.6% 2.2% 1. The 2030 Science-Based Target (SBT) is more ambitious than the 2020 “drink in your hand” goal. While both consider the entire value chain, the “drink in your hand” goal is per unit of volume. The SBT is an absolute target, so we need to achieve these reductions even with continued growth.
2. The calculation of progress toward our “drink in your hand” goal has been internally vetted using accepted and relevant scientific and technical methodologies, which are aligned with GHG Protocol Scopes 1, 2 and 3. Due to the nature of our franchise bottling system, our manufacturing emissions are normally split between Scopes 1 and 2 for company-owned facilities and Scope 3 for bottling partner facilities. However, in our “drink in your hand” calculations, we consider the full Coca-Cola system (including franchise bottling partners) in the calculation of our manufacturing, distribution and refrigeration emissions, in addition to the emissions from our ingredients and packaging.

Our Priorities & Progress


7 THE COCA‑COLA COMPANY / 2019 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 88% of our packaging recyclable globally5 10% recycled material in PET plastic packaging globally. 
WORLD WITHOUT WASTE. 
We are fundamentally rethinking how we get our products to consumers, including what kind of packaging to use and whether a package is needed at all. We believe that locally appropriate circular economy solutions that turn old packaging into new ones can reduce our packaging carbon footprint and keep plastic products out of the natural environment. We focus particularly on PET plastic because it’s our highest-volume packaging material, but its recovery rate lags that of some other materials. We’ve made progress toward our World Without Waste goals by developing models that address local challenges in packaging design, reuse and recycling. We are investing and collaborating with a range of partners on the urgent need to bring these solutions to scale.
READ MORE: World Without Waste. 
Collect and recycle a bottle or can for each one we sell by 2030.
COLLECT. 
Bring people together to support a healthy, debrisfree environment.
PARTNER 1. We changed our method to track the packaging collection rate against our World Without Waste goal beginning with 2018 data. With better data available, we expanded the metric to encompass all of our packaging types, including beverage cartons, juice boxes and pouches, etc. This reduced the collection rate from 58% to 56% for 2018. We continue to work to improve our data collection and measuring systems. As systems and methodologies improve, we will revisit our prior estimates to ensure their accuracy and make any necessary corrections to our public reporting.
2. As estimated working with our many external partners and using generally accepted, independently peer reviewed scientific and technical methods. External assurance of 100% annual replenishment rate. Finished beverages based on global sales volume. Water in production based on total system consumptive use.
3. While we have made significant progress on water efficiency in production, we recognize that we will not fully meet our goal of 25% improvement by 2020.
4. SAGP compliance data is based on supplier reporting according to our assurance requirements, which is consolidated and internally verified.
5. Only recyclable where infrastructure exists.
SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE. 
The quality and integrity of our products depends on a healthy supply chain with successful and thriving farming communities. Since 2013, our goal is to source all our priority ingredients—including our main natural sweeteners, fruit juices, coffee, tea, soy and timber products—sustainably, according to our Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGP). We have made significant progress with our suppliers to assure or certify the farms where our ingredients come from but we recognize there is more we need to do.
READ MORE: Sustainable�Agriculture. 
WATER LEADERSHIP. 
More than a decade ago, The Coca-Cola Company made a pioneering commitment to replenish the water we use in our drinks and their production. For five years running, we’ve met and exceeded that goal. We have also made steady progress toward using water more efficiently and to treat all wastewater in our production processes. Recognizing that water risks to our system and local communities are increasing with climate change and other factors, we will launch a new water strategy and goals in 2020.

8 THE COCA‑COLA COMPANY / 2019 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT. 
HUMAN RIGHTS. 
Our commitment to human rights starts with our own employees, making sure they have safe, supportive and respectful workplaces. Our suppliers and system partners are also expected to embrace responsible workplace practices. In 2003, we set a goal that 98% of our company locations and system bottlers and 95% of our direct and authorized suppliers will validate compliance with our Human Rights Policy and our Supplier Guiding Principles (SGP) by the end of 2020. As of Q4 2019, 93%1 of company-owned facilities, 92%1 of bottlers and 91%1 of suppliers reached compliance with our Human Rights Policy and SGPs.
READ MORE: Human�Rights. 
Percentage of direct suppliers that achieved compliance with our Supplier Guiding Principles 1. SGP is part of all contractual agreements between The Coca-Cola Company and our direct and authorized suppliers. The Human Rights compliance metric reflects the performance of sites and suppliers critical to the development of the product, including company operations, bottling partners, co-packers and direct suppliers of ingredients, primary packaging and dispensing equipment. SGP audits may occur in other areas as well, such as trademarked marketing and promotional equipment; however, these are not included in the metric.
EMPOWERING WOMEN. 
Our 5by20 commitment to enable the economic empowerment of 5 million women entrepreneurs across our global value chain by 2020 is on track to reach its target. As of the end of 2019, the program has empowered over 4.6 million women. First announced in 2010, the initiative sponsors programs that address business barriers faced by female entrepreneurs around the world. In 2019, we enabled the empowerment of 1,323,167 women—a 53% increase over the previous year. We collaborate with governments and NGO partners to build and execute locally relevant programs, scaling those that are most successful.
READ MORE: Empowering�Women. 
GIVING BACK. 
We want a better shared future for the communities in which we live and work, striving to have a positive impact, especially in times of need. We have pledged to give back 1% of our prior year’s operating income annually through direct company donations and funding through The Coca-Cola Foundation. In 2019, those combined efforts contributed nearly $125 million ($88 million from The Coca-Cola Foundation and $37 million from The Coca-Cola Company) to directly benefit 294 organizations across 129 countries and territories. The donation total in 2019 represented 1.3% of operating income, focused in particular on the Foundation’s giving pillars of recycling, water and women’s empowerment, contributing $18.8 million, $20.8 million and $10.9 million, respectively, to programs and projects in these three categories.

13 THE COCA‑COLA COMPANY / 2019 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT. 
OUR APPROACH TO DISCLOSURE. 
We aim to provide stakeholders with complete, transparent and candid information in all our public communications. In 2019, we combined our 2018 annual review and sustainability reports to publish our first Business and Sustainability Report. This is the second report using that integrated approach. We also respond to the CDP climate and water questionnaires and make those disclosures publicly available. For this report, we have updated our priority issues matrix and expanded our disclosure in several areas—notably climate change— and provide an index to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures for the first time.
We recognize that there is a need for standardization across reporting frameworks, and we’re always evaluating reporting options and listening to stakeholder feedback.
We have a robust reporting process that spans many years. This report is prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, a globally recognized framework; and this is the ninth year that these principles have informed our reporting process. Our investors have also expressed interest in the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and Coca-Cola participates on the SASB Advisory Group. For more information about disclosure in this report, please see the GRI Index.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. 
At The Coca-Cola Company, our sound business principles and practices foster an innovative and collaborative culture, which is committed to ethical behavior, accountability and transparency. The company’s Board of Directors has a number of committees to assist in discharging its duties. These include an Audit Committee, a Talent and Compensation Committee, a Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance, a Finance Committee, a Management Development Committee, a Public Policy and Sustainability Committee and an Executive Committee. The charter for each committee can be viewed on our website. Information about the company’s corporate governance, including our Code of Business Conduct, Corporate Governance Guidelines, Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, is also on our website. We’re interested in hearing from stakeholders and value stakeholder feedback. If you’d like to contact us, visit our website.
SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE. 
The Board’s Public Policy and Sustainability Committee assists the Board in overseeing the company’s policies and programs and related risks to the company that concern regulatory, public policy and corporate social responsibility matters, including progress against the company’s sustainability goals. The Committee’s scope includes public issues of significance that may affect the company’s business, our shareowners, the broader stakeholder community or the general public. This entails evaluating and reviewing information pertaining to social, political and environmental trends, with oversight over sustainability goals and human rights practices.
GOVERNANCE & MANAGEMENT. 
The Committee reviews, at least annually, all shareowner proposals, public policy advocacy efforts, political contributions and charitable contributions to ensure alignment with company policy. The Committee reports regularly to the full Board on these matters. The Committee also receives monthly updates on priority sustainability issues, including information on actions and progress toward goals. Annually, the Committee conducts a self-evaluation, which it presents to the full Board.
OUR SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH ACROSS THE�COCA-COLA�SYSTEM�
We pursue our sustainability goals through a concerted effort by The Coca-Cola Company and approximately 225 bottling partners in more than 200 countries and territories. We aim to achieve our ambitious goals to drive system-wide change. We have robust internal processes and an effective internal control environment that facilitate the identification and management of risks and regular communication with the Board, including the Enterprise Risk Management team and Risk Steering Committee. Beyond this, our Stakeholder Engagement function works with business units, bottling partners, NGOs, governments and people in communities all around the world to identify risks and progress toward our goals. For more about our approach to risk management and priority issues, see Our Priority Sustainability Issues.

OUR PRIORITY SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES. 
Focusing on the highest-priority environmental, social and governance issues for our company and our stakeholders is a foundational step in how we conduct business and develop our corporate strategy.
It is also foundational to how we evolve and report on our business and our sustainability efforts. During 2019, we undertook a thorough review of our priority issues in collaboration with a cross-functional internal team and key external stakeholders. The global leaders represented deep expertise across a range of issues and sectors, including NGOs, academia, some of our business partners, customers and beyond. We were guided by a leading sustainability NGO, BSR.
In this most recent analysis we further iterated on our approach by aligning with our Enterprise Risk Management process. We expanded the scope of risk-related issues beyond those identified in 2015 to include topics such as digital disruption, as well as political uncertainties and regulation.
Many of the same issues remained high priorities since our last analysis; but we note an evolution in stakeholder expectations and potential impacts to our business in several key areas. For example, climate change risk and resilience emerged as an increasing concern for our own operations, as underscored by our risk process and the climate scenarios we have elaborated.
Meanwhile, concerns about packaging are growing in importance for our stakeholders, and we recognize this issue could potentially significantly impact our business. These insights have continued to shape and influence our work on World Without Waste.
This priority issues analysis will ensure that we take into consideration the changing social, environmental and economic context as we continue to evolve our business.

Stakeholder Engagement & Partnerships


15 THE COCA‑COLA COMPANY / 2019 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT. 
Conversations and collaborations with diverse stakeholders are what made much of our success possible in 2019. We undertake a range of activities with partners across all of these areas and have included a few highlights for each.
BOTTLING PARTNERS. 
The Coca-Cola system introduced a range of innovative technologies in 2019, including KeelClip™ packaging technology, an innovative, minimalist paperboard packaging solution, which is a first for the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry. As part of this initiative, Coca-Cola will replace shrink wrap with KeelClip™ on multipacks of up to eight cans in all European Union markets by the end of 2021. Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company will invest €15 million in KeelClip™ and begin the roll-out in Ireland and Poland, followed by Austria, Italy, Switzerland and Romania in 2020. This will save 2,000 tons of plastic and 3,000 tons of CO2 annually.
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT HIGHLIGHTS PARTNERING FOR SUCCESS: OUR APPROACH TO STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. 
Our approach to partnerships and engaging with our key stakeholders aims to drive progress on our priority issues. We continue to evolve our stakeholder engagement, applying the principles of transparency, inclusiveness, consistency and accountability to promote positive impact and create a virtuous cycle of collaboration.
Throughout this report, we seek to demonstrate our ambition and leadership in the industry, using our leverage on the global challenges that require broad collective action, such as eliminating plastic waste, reducing added sugar intake, upholding human rights and fostering excellence in water stewardship and sustainable agriculture.
The insights and feedback of our key stakeholder voices are integrated into our strategy across all of our sustainability goals.
SUPPLIERS. 
Supplier diversity is an integral component of our diversity management strategy. We believe that including our customers and consumers in our procurement strategy will help develop stronger local communities while creating long-term growth and a competitive advantage for the Coca-Cola system. The company spent approximately $800 million on diverse suppliers in 2019, on the way to our goal to spend $1 billion by the end of 2020.1. 
CONSUMERS. 
Globally in 2019 we invested more than $5 million in community recycling education initiatives on top of our investments in recycling and collection infrastructure and worked with various partners to implement recycling education programs across 15 markets, reaching more than 1.3 million people and resulting in over 60,000 tons of plastic bottles collected for recycling. For example, through a partnership with JD.com in China, we piloted a two-week recycling program in Shanghai, which leveraged JD’s courier team to collect used bottles from 50,000 households where they were delivering packages. The collected bottles are then sent to recycling facilities in partnership with Coca-Cola.
CUSTOMERS. 
Partnerships with our customers are part of our global DNA, and we are proud to have partnerships in all 17 of our geographic business units. For example, Coca-Cola teamed up with South African customer, Pick n Pay, as well as Unilever, to roll out an initiative with new green People n Planet reusable bags across South Africa. Through the partnership, 43.2 tons of green recycled PET bottles were repurposed to make the first 1 million bags, which is equivalent to about 2 million 500 ml plastic bottles.

16 THE COCA‑COLA COMPANY / 2019 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT. 
GOVERNMENT. 
We seek to work collaboratively and transparently with governments around the world. For example, the company participated in activities related to the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, engaging in numerous sessions on achieving progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals. Coca-Cola leaders met with senior officials and joined key events, highlighting our actions on women’s empowerment, World Without Waste and packaging innovation.
NGOS AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. 
We engage in meaningful partnerships with NGOs around the world. Project Last Mile is our partnership with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. We are proud to collaborate with leading global health donors, partners and ministries of health to share our business capabilities to improve the availability and uptake of medicines and health services in hard-to-reach communities in 10 countries in Africa. At The Global Fund’s Replenishment Conference hosted by the French government, in 2019, The Coca-Cola Foundation committed $2 million to extend our funding of Project Last Mile through 2024, to continue to scale interventions and deepen impact. For example, in South Africa, Project Last Mile, working closely with USAID, has contributed to increasing access to antiretrovirals and chronic medications by over 500%—reaching a cumulative total of over 2.89 million patients— through using our commercial expertise to help the National Department of Health, USAID and partners to expand alternative pick-up points from 180 locations to more than 1,800 since 2016, thereby reducing strain on hospital infrastructure and ensuring patients do not have to choose between renewing their prescriptions and earning a living.
DISCLOSURE ORGANIZATIONS. 
We participated in progressive dialogue on effective reporting and disclosure on our business and the long-term interests of our shareowners and other stakeholders, including our participation on the SASB Advisory Group and the Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable (BIER). In addition, we hosted representatives from the CDP at the company headquarters to discuss investor engagement and climate and water risk reporting.
INDUSTRY. 
We believe in transparent pre-competitive collaboration with other companies, including our peers and competitors, to achieve the necessary scale and impact on our shared sustainability issues, including agriculture, climate, packaging and water. One example of such action is the 2030 Water Resources Group. In November 2019, we joined a global 2030 Water Resource Group meeting in Peru, convening a steering committee comprised of industry and NGO leaders. As one of the first countries to successfully implement water related policy reforms through this collaboration, the gathering was an opportunity to explore cross-sector cooperation for water stewardship. Our dedication to this group stems from our belief that water is a public resource, and it is therefore our responsibility to find and support effective policy solutions.
EMPLOYEES. 
Our employees are the heart of Coca-Cola, and they have a passion for helping communities. Employees participated in a United Way campaign supporting communities facing poverty, homelessness and financial illiteracy. Employees raised $500,000 and volunteered more than 2,000 hours to help thousands of families achieve their full potential and lead healthy, productive lives.
MEDIA. 
Coca-Cola Chairman and CEO James Quincey shared our sustainability goals in media appearances around the world. He talked about the need for cross-sector collaboration during a World Economic Forum panel that included key industry and government officials; in Africa, he shared our focus on growing sustainably across the continent; and at the New York Stock Exchange, he celebrated the 100th anniversary of the company’s initial public offering by highlighting our plans for sustainable growth.
INVESTORS. 
We undertook a range of activity with investors throughout the year. In August 2019, along with 180 other CEOs, James Quincey signed the Business Roundtable’s statement on the Purpose of a Corporation to demonstrate our commitment to all stakeholders. And in a follow-up in September, the company held an investor dialogue on Environment, Social, Governance-related topics at our London office, welcoming 30 investors from large and medium-size firms in the U.S. and Europe who own a collective ~20% of total shares outstanding. The event focused on the company’s sustainable business strategy, exploring priority issues including sugar reduction, World Without Waste and water management.

19 THE COCA‑COLA COMPANY / 2019 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT. 
REDUCING ADDED SUGAR. 
Leading health authorities have recommended that individuals should not consume more than 10% of their total calories from added sugar.
At The Coca-Cola Company, we’ve embraced this recommendation, providing choices that support what consumers want and need. In recent years, we have been aggressively changing recipes to reduce added sugar, promoting low- and no-calorie beverage options, and making smaller packages more available to enable portion control. We have also been expanding our range of beverages— including water, coffee, tea, dairy, fruit juices and plant-based options—and developing the next generation of sugar alternatives.
We’re exploring and bringing to market new sugar alternatives that help us keep the great tastes people love but with less added sugar and fewer calories. For example, the global sales volume of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar grew by double digits in 2019 for the third consecutive year.
We are tracking the results of these efforts, and the majority of the added sugar reductions stem from changes to our sparkling beverage recipes and packaging size reductions.
Average calories per pack1 dropped by 1.7% in 2019 and 1.8% in 2018.
LOCAL PLEDGES. 
We have joined industry partners globally as part of our ongoing effort to reduce added sugar. In Mexico, we recently agreed through the Mexican Beverage Industry Association to further reduce the calorie content of the food and beverage industry’s portfolio by 20% between 2018 and 2024. For Coca-Cola, this reduction will be achieved by changing the recipes in more than 50 products. This pledge in Mexico builds on the significant reformulation work we have been doing there for the last decade. Over the past 10 years, calories in Coca-Cola Mexico’s beverage portfolio have been reduced by over 20%.
In the European Union, we are on track to meet the voluntary commitment we made with our industry peers to reduce the average added sugar content of still and carbonated soft drinks by 10% by 2020, building on the 12% reduction already achieved since 2000. A mid-term evaluation released in 2019 found that the average sugar level in European soft drinks was reduced by 11.9% from 2015 to 2017.
The Australian Beverages Council pledged a reduction in added sugar across the industry by 10% on average by 2020 and 20% by 2025. And in the United States, a recent analysis of progress toward the industry’s Balance Calories Initiative (BCI) goal of a national 20% reduction in beverage calories per person showed 2018 was the second year in a row of declines in beverage calorie consumption. The report, released by Keybridge in 2019, showed that calories per person per day fell at a faster rate in 2018 than in previous years. Overall, average beverage calorie consumption nationally has declined 3% per person per day since the baseline year of 2014.

TOTAL REFORMULATIONS GLOBALLY. 
RESPONDING TO LOCAL CONDITIONS TO REDUCE ADDED SUGAR. 
We are taking action on added sugar reduction even where it means changes to our most popular, time-tested products—putting our strength in innovation to meet our consumers’ evolving needs.
In Spain and Portugal, for example, we have a long history of successfully cutting added sugar in our beverages. We have reduced added sugar per liter in Spain by 50% across the total portfolio and by 37% in Portugal, both over the last 20 years.
Our new Coca-Cola Trademark recipe with 30% less added sugar began in Mexico in 2018 and has since been rolled out to more than 25 international markets. The new formula has removed approximately 280,000 tons of added sugar.

RESPONSIBLE MARKETING. 
We do not target our advertising to children under age 12, anywhere in the world. Our policy applies to all our products, regardless of nutritional profile, as we honor the rights of parents and caregivers to make choices for their children.
Our policy responds to changing societal concerns and we partner with industry to scale collective action, including in responsible marketing pledge programs of the International Food & Beverage Alliance (IFBA) at global level, the EU Pledge in the European Union and The Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (CFBAI) in the United States.
MAKING SMALLER PACKAGES. 
Smaller packaging helps people control added sugar intake more easily for themselves and their families.
OFFERING MORE DRINKS WITH NUTRITION BENEFITS. 
We’re bringing drinks such as organic tea, coconut water, juices and purified water to more people in more places.
Wherever we can, we’re making many of our beverages better and more nutritious by providing vitamins, minerals and electrolytes, while also introducing more dairy and plantbased beverages. These include the following:
GIVING PEOPLE THE INFORMATION THEY NEED. 
We lead the food and beverage industry by putting clear, easy-to-find nutrition information right up front on our packages to support informed choices. Nearly 100% of our products globally, except water, provide front of pack energy/calorie information.2. 
Max the Lion was a popular mascot for the AdeS brand, which we acquired in 2017. But the image went against our policy of marketing to children under 12 years old, so we redesigned our packaging with drawings of fruits and other ingredients.

Calorie information (expressed as calories, kilocalories, or kilojoules) is provided on the front of our packages, with the exception of returnable or refillable proprietary and multipurpose bottles (glass and plastic) with permanent printed labels; and unflavored and unsweetened still or sparkling bottled water, including mineral water.

23 THE COCA‑COLA COMPANY / 2019 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT. 
CLIMATE CHANGE GOVERNANCE. 
We have several processes to ensure that risks relevant to sustainability, including climate change, are evaluated on a regular basis. We regularly summarize the top risks for discussion with company leadership, including the Board of Directors, and TCFD recommendations also inform our approach.
From a corporate perspective, we develop and issue climate strategy guidance across the business. This corporate guidance is developed by a core team driving our corporate strategy on issues related to climate change, with input from a broad set of functions, such as Enterprise Risk Management, Procurement, Operations, Technical and Public Affairs and Sustainability, as well as some of our geographical business units and bottling partners.
Each business unit, function or department is responsible for actively managing and monitoring its respective risks throughout the year. Relevant risks that could materially affect our business and financial results are disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. This includes risks relating to climate change and its potential impacts on our business, such as those related to water scarcity and quality, and supply chain disruption.
A HISTORY OF CLIMATE ACTION. 
Coca-Cola has a long history of action on climate, from our leading initiatives in reducing energy use in refrigeration in the 1990s to our operational and supply chain efforts to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our manufacturing operations in the early 2000s.
Our “drink in your hand” goal was set in 2013 to take a bigger step toward reducing GHG emissions across our full value chain. And this goal has proven a worthy ambition as we managed to cut our carbon footprint by 24% toward our target of a 25% reduction by the end of 2020, against a 2010 baseline.
Since setting that goal, we have recognized the need for even more ambitious, integrated climate action. From the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015 to more recent youth climate action, we hear—and agree with— global stakeholders’ call for business to be part of the climate solution. We also recognize the need to engage more with our employees, suppliers and investors who are increasingly on board with an agenda to reduce and avoid emissions as rapidly as possible.
This target aligns with the guidance of the Science-Based Targets initiative. The aim is to promote corporate climate targets in line with what is necessary to meet the Paris Agreement goals—to limit global warming to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.
Achieving these reductions will require us to continue the progress we have already made, while building new programs. Our ongoing efforts with water, World Without Waste, sugar reductions and sustainable agriculture can help us achieve a significant portion of the required reduction. Increasing renewable energy usage across the world can help achieve more. However, fully achieving this goal will require us to innovate and adapt on topics ranging from cold drinks equipment, ingredient or packaging sourcing, and more. We will also increase our climate efforts with supplier engagement programs on cold drink equipment and renewable energy.
We know we can’t achieve these goals alone. We will be partnering with suppliers, customers, peers and competitors, NGO stakeholders and governments in new ways to shape programs and policy that drive impact.
CARBON TRANSPARENCY IS KEY TO PROGRESS. 
The urgency of climate change requires us to rethink how we plan for the future. It pushes us to develop new business models, partnerships and solutions for a more resilient Coca-Cola system. To guide us, we are using the framework developed by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to identify key climate risks and potential opportunities across our business and position ourselves to disclose these risks to our stakeholders, shareholders and customers.
PROGRESS TO “DRINK IN YOUR HAND” GOAL. 
A BOLD NEW CLIMATE GOAL. 
This is a time for collective, ambitious and positive climate action on one of the most pressing global issues. To that end, in 2019 we published a Science-Based Target2 for the Coca-Cola system, which aims to further decrease our carbon footprint across the system.
GOAL. 
Science-Based Target aligned with the Paris Agreement Goals. 
Reduce absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions 25% by 2030 from a 2015 base-year.
1. The calculation of progress toward our “drink in your hand” goal has been internally vetted using accepted and relevant scientific and technical methodologies, which are aligned with GHG Protocol Scopes 1, 2 and 3. Due to the nature of our franchise bottling system, our manufacturing emissions are normally split between Scopes 1 and 2 for company-owned facilities and Scope 3 for bottling partner facilities. However, in our “drink in your hand” calculations, we consider the full Coca-Cola system (including franchise bottling partners) in the calculation of our manufacturing, distribution and refrigeration emissions.
2. The 2030 Science-Based Target is more ambitious than the 2020 “drink in your hand” goal. While both consider the entire value chain, the “drink in your hand” goal is per unit of volume. The SBT is an absolute target, so we need to achieve these reductions even with continued growth.
Throughout this report we include material that responds to the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and provide a comprehensive index in the Reporting Frameworks.
We also provide a robust response to the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) which is publicly available here, and includes additional detail on climate-related risks and opportunities.

24 THE COCA‑COLA COMPANY / 2019 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT. 
OUR APPROACH TO CLIMATE RESILIENCE. 
Along with announcing our Science-Based Target, we have also updated our overall climate resilience strategy. We think of resilience in two ways: 1. our capacity to recover from or adapt to the physical impacts of climate change, and 2. our ability to respond to the impacts of policy and market shifts brought about in response to climate change.
This cross-cutting effort affects many issues explored more deeply in this report, including being active water stewards, reducing packaging waste and closing the loop on post-consumer materials, incentivizing farmers to grow our ingredients in more sustainable ways, and considering the climate impacts of our operations as we innovate for increased efficiency and better value creation in a climate-friendly future.
To guide our approach, we have mapped the potential risks across our entire value chain and on three dimensions: the effects of extreme weather events; the longer-term impacts of a changing climate; and potential changes to markets in which we operate. An overview of this assessment can be found here.
BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE. 
A key part of our enterprise risk management is our Business Continuity Planning (BCP) process, which has been critical to managing the impacts of climate change that we are already experiencing while also anticipating what may affect us in the future. With a dedicated business continuity manager at each of our concentrate production sites, the team allocates at least 6,000 hours per year to this aspect of our risk management and planning. When these continuity plans are triggered by an event such as severe weather, there are often losses and other impacts to operations. However, this BCP process helps to minimize these losses and impacts.

CLIMATE RESILIENCE IN ACTION. 
With rising global average temperatures, the world is experiencing an increase in frequency and severity of storms, fires and other disasters. Our response: continue to cut our carbon footprint, promote water and agricultural resilience, and actively contribute to the communities affected by these disasters.
CONTRIBUTING WHERE DISASTERS STRIKE. 
In 2019 alone, Tropical Storm Pabuk devasted areas of Thailand, Hurricane Dorian struck the Bahamas and Puerto Rico, two separate typhoons slammed into Japan, and severe fires scorched parts of Brazil and Australia. Events like these have impacts on our business and on the communities we serve. For the long term, we believe that the actions we take to cut our own carbon footprint, and to promote water and agricultural resilience, will contribute to solutions. But when the communities affected by these disasters need immediate help, we also actively contribute to and rally support for relief efforts.

WORLD WITHOUT WASTE RECYCLING AND BEYOND. 
THE COCA‑COLA COMPANY / 2019 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 26. 
Our people are implementing innovative initiatives in these areas all around the world. Each of our business units has a plan to achieve the goals, with strong executive focus on progress against our goals, increasing internal accountability for meeting them.
The Coca-Cola Company and our bottling partners are taking a hard look at the packaging we use, in light of the interconnected global challenges of packaging waste and climate change. In 2018, we launched World Without Waste, which has three fundamental goals: 1 DESIGN Make 100% of our packaging recyclable globally by 2025—and use at least 50% recycled material in our packaging by 2030.
2 COLLECT Collect and recycle a bottle or can for each one we sell by 2030.
3 PARTNER Bring people together to support a healthy, debris-free environment.

27 THE COCA‑COLA COMPANY / 2019 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT. 
DESIGN. 
We are fundamentally rethinking how we get our products to consumers, including what kind of packaging to use and whether a package is needed at all.
Each packaging type has its own benefits and trade-offs, depending on the material and its attributes, such as its recycled content, reusability and recyclability; the rate at which the package is recovered; and its impacts if it is not properly managed when discarded. We are working to make all of our packaging more sustainable.
Across our value chain, packaging accounts for 25% to 30% of our carbon footprint. We believe that locally appropriate circular economy solutions that turn old packaging into new packaging can reduce the climate footprint of our packaging and keep plastic products out of the natural environment. Both our Design and Collect efforts focus particularly on PET because it’s our highest-volume packaging material and its collection rate has historically lagged that of aluminum, our next biggest category, in many markets.
INNOVATING AROUND THE WORLD. 
PET. 
PET is a versatile, lightweight material that is highly recyclable. Its carbon footprint varies from low to moderate depending on the input material (recycled, plant-based or virgin) and whether the bottle is collected and refilled or recycled. • 16 markets offer beverages packaged in 100% recycled PET (rPET) bottles, with more to come. Water brands in Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Peru, the Philippines, Switzerland, South Africa and Uruguay, among others, are now making water bottles entirely from recycled plastic.
• From the end of 2019, 7 out of 10 of all bottles in Australia are now being made entirely from recycled plastic. • In multiple markets, Sprite packaging was changed from green to clear bottles, which makes them more valuable by improving the efficiency of the recycling stream.
• 100% rPET will be used for all plastic bottles in Sweden beginning in 2020, eliminating the use of 3,500 tons of virgin plastic and reducing emissions by 25%.
• In Brazil, all 2-liter bottles across Trademark Coca-Cola, Fanta and Sprite brands are sold in refillable “universal bottles” that are the same shape, size and color, which increases the efficiency of collection, cleaning and filling. The reusable bottles are replacing 200 million regular bottles each year. In addition to Brazil, refillables are a critical part of our World Without Waste strategy in many markets. In over 25 countries, refillables make up half or more of our sales today, and in more than 50 countries, refillables currently represent 25% or more of the sales portfolio, including Germany, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Pakistan, Kenya, the Philippines and Tanzania. • Over 650,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions—equivalent to burning approximately 1.5 million barrels of oil—have been averted through use of our PlantBottle, which incorporates 30% plant-based material. An innovative technology co-developed by Changchun Meihe Science and Technology and The Coca-Cola Company to efficiently produce a renewable material that can be used to make our PET plastic bottles is one step closer to commercialization. With our recent successful validation of the process at the “demo” scale, we are advancing to a future where PET plastic bottles can be made, in part, from wood waste. These bottles will remain 100% recyclable and will help us continue our progress toward an exciting future beyond fossil fuels.
ALUMINUM. 
Aluminum is lightweight, high-value, nearly infinitely recyclable and preferred by some consumers because it’s recycled at a relatively high rate. Its carbon footprint varies from moderate to high depending on whether it is made from energy-intensive virgin aluminum (and what that energy source is) or recovered aluminum. • In the U.S., DASANI introduced water in an aluminum can in 2019 and will introduce an aluminum bottle in 2020. Together with a hybrid plant-rPET bottle, increased recycled content, light-weighting, and package-less delivery, these changes will remove the equivalent of 1 billion virgin plastic bottles from DASANI’s production over five years.
GLASS. 
As a heavy, breakable and sometimes lowvalue material, glass is less attractive to recycle than other materials. However, it can be manufactured to be readily refillable and has a low carbon footprint when collected and refilled.
CARTONS AND POUCHES. 
Packages made of a combination of paper, plastic and foil have relatively low carbon footprints and are compact and lightweight, but they are only recyclable where infrastructure exists.
BRING YOUR OWN PACKAGE. 
Increasingly, many consumers carry reusable bottles and cups, and we’re inventing a variety of ways for them to enjoy our products. • 15 million drinks per day (5.5 billion per�year) are poured from approximately 52,000 Coca-Cola Freestyle units in the U.S. and other countries. We introduced refillable, microchipped cups that interact with Coca-Cola Freestyle at select cruise lines, amusement parks and universities.
• DASANI PureFill water dispensers, piloted in 2017, provide filtered water to users who bring their own bottles, with the option to add flavor or carbonation.
• 84 Bonaqua stations rolled out across Hong Kong in 2019, allowing customers to fill their own cups with Bonaqua’s assortment of flavored waters. Another 404 stations are scheduled to be installed across the region in 2020.
• In 2019 we partnered with TerraCycle on the Loop initiative, which is giving consumers the ability to use refillable containers for a variety of beverages in Western Europe, including our sparkling drinks and iced teas, through a European retailer.

COLLECT. 
To create circular solutions, cut the carbon footprint of our packaging, and ensure that packaging stays out of the environment, we need locally relevant packaging types, waste management infrastructure and incentives.
With operations in more than 200 countries and territories, we are deploying a marketby-market strategy that takes this complexity into account. We’ve made progress toward our World Without Waste Collect goal by developing successful models and we are investing and partnering with others in industry, government and civil society on the urgent need to bring these solutions to scale.
Through 10-year sourcing plans with our bottling partners and suppliers, we are exploring how to support additional rPET capacity in each region. These investments not only provide a source of recycled content for our packages, but also create additional demand for empty packages, driving increased collection.

In Australia, our bottling partner Coca-Cola Amatil is leading or collaborating to run deposit return systems in all Australian states.
1 CREATING THE LARGEST BOTTLE-TO-BOTTLE�FACILITY. 
Over 18 years, we invested $100 million+ to create the world’s largest bottle-to-bottle recycling facility, enabling our system to achieve an estimated 56% PET collection rate in Mexico.
2 SUPPORTING INNOVATION. 
The Coca-Cola Foundation announced $5.4 million in recycling grants to support innovative pilots in seven United States communities. And with industry partners, we announced a new $100 million industry fund that will be matched three-to-one by other grants and investors and be used to improve sorting, processing and collection in areas with the biggest infrastructure gaps to help increase the amount of recycled plastic available to be remade into beverage bottles.
3 TAKING A COOPERATIVE APPROACH. 
In Brazil, we are accelerating refillable packaging growth and focusing on PET collection by working with 233 recycling cooperatives. In 2019, the volume of recycled materials processed by the co-ops more than doubled, to over 106,000 tons.
4 EXPANDING A COLLECTION MODEL. 
In 2019, we launched the PET Recycling Company in Ethiopia to develop bottle-to-bottle recycling, building the successful multistakeholder approach we pioneered in South Africa and implemented in Kenya. Learn more.
5 CIRCULAR ECONOMY ROADMAP FOR PET BOTTLES. 
We commissioned “Full Circle: Accelerating the circular economy for post-consumer PET bottles in Southeast Asia” to provide a first-ever comparative study of the PET bottle collection and recycling landscape across Southeast Asia— and a roadmap for what businesses, governments and investors can do to accelerate the circular economy in the region.

29 THE COCA‑COLA COMPANY / 2019 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT. 
GLOBAL SOUTHEAST ASIA INDIA. 
PARTNER. 
Given the magnitude of the waste challenge and the level of ambition of our goals, scale matters. And implementing successful solutions at scale requires multi-stakeholder partnerships that create platforms for delivering innovative, effective approaches that take into account that different approaches work in different places.
We’ve been putting our convening power to good use, establishing or joining 10 global packaging recycling partnerships in 2018 alone. We continued this work in 2019 in all 17 of our geographic business units.
The�Coca-Cola�Foundation and the Benioff� Ocean Initiative at the University of California Santa Barbara’s Marine Science Institute are partnering to implement nine river cleanup programs in Panama, Vietnam, India, Indonesia, Ecuador, Mexico, Thailand, Jamaica and Kenya. Together, we have committed $11 million over three years to support strategies that both capture plastic waste before it reaches the ocean and develop policies and communications to prevent plastic waste from entering the rivers in the first place.
Inspired in part by the successful PETCO model in Southern and Eastern Africa— and drawing on the Full Circle data analysis— The Coca-Cola Company system is catalyzing and joining partnerships to build packaging recycling organizations in several countries. For example, we played a major role in a CEO-launched recycling effort in Vietnam that includes Nestlé, Tetra Pak, Friesland Campina, La Vie, NutiFood, Suntory PepsiCo Vietnam, TH Group and URC.
Coca-Cola India joined the PET�Packaging� Manufacturers of Clean Environment (PACE), the first industry-wide packaging recycling organization in India and Asia’s largest packaging waste management venture. PACE will mobilize more than $140 million in assets with a goal to recycle all packaging material by 2025 through a network of 125 material recovery facilities and 2,500+ aggregators across the country.
The company entered a regional corporate alliance with Nestlé, Diageo, Heineken and Unilever to facilitate cooperation and provide strategic support for developing waste management infrastructure in East, West and Southern Africa. Along with bottling partners, the alliance has committed to a three-year investment to stimulate plastic recycling industries and educate people about what, how and where to recycle. In 2019, the company, along with its bottling partners, invested USD $5.125 million to boost recycling industries across eight African countries.
In the United States, we joined PepsiCo and Keurig�Dr.�Pepper, the American�Beverage� Association and key NGO partners to announce an industry-wide effort to reduce our use of new plastic. The “Every Bottle Back” initiative includes a $100 million industry fund managed by Closed Loop Partners and the Recycling Partnership to help improve sorting, processing and collection of plastic bottles for reuse to make new bottles; a consumer education campaign; on-package messaging about recyclability and measurement and validation of the industry’s progress by World Wildlife Fund.
We are a founding member of and major contributor to the World Economic Forum Global�Plastic�Action�Partnership�(GPAP), which aims to foster collaboration between governments and stakeholders in coastal communities to tackle plastic waste issues. GPAP supports our existing work to address plastic waste, including at a local level in Indonesia, the second largest global contributor to ocean plastic waste. National Plastic�Action�Partnerships�(NPAPs) have now been launched in Indonesia and Ghana. In 2019, our Ghanaian partner Repatrn increased its collection capacity to about 850 tons a month as part of the local implementation.

WORKING TOWARD CLOSED LOOP. 
In the early 2000s, South Africa had minimal recycling infrastructure and rates were in the single digits. We proposed a holistic approach that provided infrastructure for recycling centers and supported collection through the provision of collection infrastructure and training of informal collectors. PETCO was born, creating 68,000 income opportunities in the process.
Thanks in large part to PETCO and our partners in industry, South Africa was able to recycle 63% of its PET plastic bottles in 2018.

Extensive Plastic Collection Launches across Africa. 
The Coca-Cola Company worked with the PET plastic bottle industry in South Africa to become one of the founding members of the PET Recycling Company (PETCO). Building on that success, we launched PETCO Kenya in 2018 and PETCO Ethiopia in 2019, with plans for PETCO Tanzania in 2020. The shared goal: 100% of PET beverage bottles collected for recycling.
EXPANDING A SUCCESSFUL COLLECTION MODEL. 
Together we are expanding the PETCO recycling model across Eastern Africa, building on the successful multi-stakeholder approach pioneered in South Africa. Versatile and lightweight, PET plastic is 100% recyclable when designed according to basic design principles. In Kenya, PET bottles collected for recycling rate rose from 5% when PETCO Kenya launched in 2018 to 35% one year later.
Our intent in each country is to have more PET beverage bottles collected for recycling than we put into the market. We believe a World Without Waste is possible, and we’re working toward it together.

32 THE COCA‑COLA COMPANY / 2019 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT. 
MANAGING WATER IN OUR OPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAIN. 
The Coca-Cola Company has been a leader in water for more than a decade.
The foundation of our water stewardship work is our comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation strategy from the global enterprise level to each local plant in our system and in the surrounding communities. These assessments provide the basis for the water management plans of each facility and guide the targets on water use efficiency and reuse (see below). In addition, we ensure that any wastewater that leaves our bottling facilities is safe for nature, other productive uses (e.g., irrigation) or recharge of groundwater aquifers.
We estimate that approximately 85% of the total water footprint of our products comes from our agricultural ingredient supply chain. Our Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGP) and the standards we accept for sustainable sourcing of agricultural ingredients include extensive water management requirements, such as measuring extraction, implementing efficient irrigation technologies, managing run-off and building healthy soils (see the sustainable agriculture section).
During 2019, we continued to improve the efficiency of our water use. We now need only 1.85 liters of water per liter of final product, an 18% improvement compared to 2010. We recognize that we will come close to, but not fully meet, our goal of 25% improvement by 2020 due to the significant changes in our product and packaging portfolio. For example, more diverse product ranges and smaller or refillable packages limit the efficiencies in bottling production. At the same time, we have increased water reuse and are working on new, transparent metrics for water use going forward.

REPLENISHING WATER TO NATURE AND COMMUNITIES. 
More than a decade ago, The Coca-Cola Company made a pioneering commitment to replenish 100% of the water we use.
For five years running, we have now met and exceeded that goal through about 300 projects every year in collaboration with local partners, replenishing more than 1 trillion liters in total.
So what does replenish look like in action? Here’s a sample of our projects that show how replenishment can drive multiple benefits.
IMPROVING WATER QUALITY. 
In China, the “Happy Farmland” project was launched in 2011 to help address water pollution from the booming rural hospitality business. In collaboration with the United Nations Development Program, World Wildlife Fund, and China International Center of Economy and Technology Exchange, local government and other local partners constructed more than 20 wetlands in seven provinces with enough capacity to treat the wastewater from guest-houses hosting millions of visitors each year. The wetlands use plants to biologically treat wastewater until it is clean enough to discharge to local rivers, helping to protect local rural landscapes and benefiting more than 4 million people.
CAPTURING AND STORING WATER IN NATURE. 
Passing through 10 countries, the Danube delivers ecosystem services such as biodiversity, flood control, recreation and water quality. The Living Danube Partnership, a unique, cross-sectoral collaboration that brings together World Wildlife Fund, The Coca-Cola Foundation and the Coca-Cola system as well as the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR), is working to protect this unique ecosystem. Through 2019, the fifth year of our seven-year commitment to the project, we had restored 30 square kilometers in wetlands in six countries, replenished 15.6 million cubic meters of water and reached nine million people through an outreach campaign.
WATER USE IN AGRICULTURE. 
More than half of India faces high to extremely high water stress, according to the World Resources Institute, and 85% of water use in the country is for irrigation. Capturing seasonal monsoon rains, for example through the construction of check dams and rainwater harvesting structures, is critical in rural areas. Since 2009, Anandana—The Coca-Cola India Foundation—has created more than 13 billion liters of water replenishment potential through 150 community water conservation projects, impacting over 600,000 lives across 500+ villages in remote and water-stressed areas across the country. The projects emphasize community participation with a focus on women, who often reach supervisory roles in village “Pani Samitis” (water committees), to ensure the maintenance and sustainability of the community water projects.
PROVIDING WATER TO VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. 
In Nairobi, Kenya, The Coca-Cola Foundation’s Replenish Africa Initiative (RAIN), partnering with Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company and The Nature Conservancy, has helped reduce the city’s water treatment costs by 30% and enabled the system to expand to serve an additional 800,000 people. This was made possible by the Upper Tana-Nairobi Water Fund, Africa’s first water fund, which worked with tens of thousands of smallholder farmers to improve the management and sustainable use of rural lands in the watershed. In addition to protecting their soil, farmers also significantly improve their livelihoods through water conservation, women’s empowerment and forest protection, which also address climate change and provide a voice to rural farmers.
STRENGTHENING OUR RESPONSE AS WATER RISKS INCREASE. 
Global risks to water security continue to increase. Urbanization, population growth, growing water demands and other factors are driving increased water stress and degrading water quality. The impacts of climate change are amplifying the waterrelated risks to our system, supply chain and the communities in which we operate.
In 2019, we conducted a comprehensive study of our global water risk context, and we are working on a new enterprise water footprint assessment to better understand where our facilities and ingredient sourcing touches water-stressed areas. The assessment shows that more than 250 of our facilities, which are located close to our markets, are currently operating in a highly water-stressed context.
We also reached out to internal and external stakeholders to gain insight and input to our new water strategy, which will be launched in 2020. The strategy will deepen our focus on relevant, watershedbased actions that address our operations, supply chain and communities, including more water- and climate-smart agriculture.
We are developing tailored targets that reflect global trends and the growth of our business, linked to community sustainability, climate change and water security for all.
Our RAIN initiative has reached 5 million people in 41 countries in Africa with safe, sustainable access to water, sanitation and hygiene, impacting 3,000 communities.

WATER FUNDS. 
A Force for Water Security. 
Working with The Coca-Cola Company, our bottlers and partners around the world, The Nature Conservancy has created Water Funds, a collective action mechanism for water security often focused on rural watersheds that downstream urban centers depend upon.
PROVIDING WATER TO VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. 
The Water Funds share key characteristics, taking action to encourage and drive implementation of natural infrastructure and other innovative projects at the basin level, while offering an attractive vehicle of costeffective investments in source watersheds. By promoting sustainable agriculture, natural infrastructure and other water-conserving practices in the rural watersheds that provide urban water supplies, the Water Funds improve the sustainability and the resilience of both kinds of communities.
BUILDING A SUCCESSFUL, ADAPTIVE MODEL. 
The Latin America Water Funds Partnership was created in 2011 by Fundacion FEMSA, the foundation of our bottler partner in Mexico, Global Environment Fund, The Nature Conservancy, Inter-American Development Bank, and the International Climate Initiative (IKI). Projects in Mexico highlight how the concept adapts to local conditions and challenges. In Mexico City, overexploitation of aquifers is causing the land to sink, so Agua Capital focuses on increasing underground water recharge levels and more efficient use of this precious resource. The fund for the City of Monterrey targets flood prevention and improving infiltration so the San Juan River basin absorbs more water. The 25 Water Funds created to date in the region involve hundreds of public and private partners, and tens of thousands of families and individuals engaged upstream.
TAKING THE MODEL GLOBAL. 
Based on the success of the model developed in Latin America, The Nature Conservancy aims to catalyze the creation of 300 Water Funds throughout the world, with the help of numerous partners including The Coca-Cola Company. Africa’s first such fund, the Upper Tana-Nairobi Water Fund, created in 2015, is working with tens of thousands of smallholder farmers on water conservation, soil management, women’s empowerment and forest protection to improve both livelihoods and sustainable use of rural lands in the watershed.

36 THE COCA‑COLA COMPANY / 2019 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT. 
OUR APPROACH AND PROGRESS. 
At The Coca-Cola Company, we source a wide range of agricultural ingredients—including sugar, corn, fruit juices, coffee, tea and soy, as well as an expanding range of ingredients such as nuts, herbs and dairy—from a complex global supply chain. Ensuring that these ingredients are produced in a way that respects farmworkers and their communities while also protecting ecosystems is important to our company.
We are committed to working with our suppliers to promote sustainable agricultural practices and build supplier capabilities to meet the standards for human and workplace rights, environmental protection and responsible farm management that are set out in our Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGP). We ask our suppliers to demonstrate they are meeting the SAGP criteria by using global sustainable agriculture standards and assurance schemes. The Farm Sustainability Assessment of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform, the Bonsucro sustainable sugarcane standard and Rainforest Alliance certifications are some of the leading standards we support. Read more about our approach.
We are currently tracking SAGP compliance of 13 global priority ingredients, which represent about 80% of our total annual agricultural ingredient purchases. In 2019, 54% of these ingredient volumes were SAGP-compliant (up from 8% in 2013, the beginning of the program).
We continue to make progress, but we know we still have a long way to go to achieve the goal of fully verified sustainable agriculture ingredient sourcing. Through 2020, we are revising our sustainable agriculture program toward a longer-term approach that reflects our expanding portfolio and supply chains.
TRACKING PROGRESS 1. SAGP compliance data is based on supplier reporting according to our assurance requirements, which is consolidated and internally verified. Results can fluctuate due to changes in sourcing origins while we get new suppliers on board with our requirements. This is the first year we report pulp and paper data, representing 75% of our current global purchase volume.

37 THE COCA‑COLA COMPANY / 2019 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 1. Voluntary sustainability standards could significantly reduce detrimental impacts of global agriculture, W. K. Smith, E. Nelson, J. A. Johnson, S. Polasky, J. C. Milder, J. S. Gerber, P. C. West, S. Siebert, K. A. Brauman, K. M. Carlson, M. Arbuthnot, J. P. Rozza, D. N. Pennington, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Feb 2019, 116 (6) 2130-2137; DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1707812116.
THE PATH TO RESILIENCE IS UNDER OUR FEET. 
As climate change leads to more erratic and extreme weather, more sustainable agricultural practices will play a vital role in promoting resilience across our supply chain and in the communities that provide our agricultural ingredients. The ingredients used in our products account for 20% to 25% of our climate footprint and about 85% of our water footprint. Agriculture is also connected to rural livelihoods and women’s empowerment.
Our sustainable agriculture strategy is strongly linked to our water and climate strategies, which we are updating to reflect the integrated nature of these issues.
While agriculture is a source of greenhouse gas emissions, the practices encouraged in our Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles are designed to reduce those emissions and to support healthy soils that ultimately will be capable of sequestering and storing carbon. Along with this climate-positive impact, soils rich in organic matter also hold more water, helping to prevent flooding and erosion, while also mitigating the effects of drought and supporting the resilience of farmers and farming communities.
A peer-reviewed study published in 2019, supported by the global partnership of WWF and The Coca-Cola Company, found that full adoption of the Bonsucro Standard across the sugarcane sector would increase yields and cut GHG emissions in half while reducing total production area by 24%, water use by 65% and waterpolluting nutrient loading by 34%.1. 
SMALLHOLDERS, BIG OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR ORANGE SUPPLY CHAIN IN BRAZIL. 
In 2019, we launched a farm development program with the aim to help 480 smallholder orange growers in Brazil improve their farming practices. Over a three-year period, the project aims to support participating growers meet Brazilian legislation with a specific focus on labor law and occupational health and safety. At least 50% of the participating growers should adopt international best practices (equivalent to SAI-FSA Bronze level) while maintaining a focus on continuous improvement. The project was launched through a collaborative partnership between The Coca-Cola Company, The Coca-Cola Foundation, innocent drinks, Solidaridad, Cutrale (our largest orange juice supplier in Brazil), and other partners.
Respecting human rights in our business and supply chain is critical to our company. Delivering on a commitment made in 2013, we have completed 21 studies of human rights in key countries supplying sugar to our company and are following up on issues identified.

MEETHA SONA UNNATI. 
Supporting Smallholder Sugarcane Farmers in India. 
The Meetha Sona Unnati project invests in sustainable agriculture training and capacity building for more than 48,000 smallholder sugarcane farmers, including women farmers— taking on issues of water efficiency, soil health, human rights and women’s rights related to farming.
The project encourages local smallholders across Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state of India, to increase yields, water use and soil health through mechanization, field levelling and innovative planting techniques. It also strengthens local mill management systems to accelerate adoption of sustainable production standards.
While helping us to achieve our sustainable agriculture goals, project outreach and interventions extend beyond our sourcing area, positively influencing practices of a larger number of farmers and farming communities. Meetha Sona Unnati acts on the principle that sustainable agriculture practices are important for all.
HELPING SMALLHOLDER FARMERS SUCCEED. 
To help overcome the challenges of degraded soils, water availability, poor yields and the increasing cost of cultivation, while also protecting natural resources, Meetha Sona Unnati promotes the following practices.
INTERCROPPING Growing two or more crops in close proximity to increase yields, taking advantage of resources or ecological processes beyond what a single crop would use.
SOIL MANAGEMENT Enhancing soil health to improve its productivity and resilience through conservation, amendment and other practices.
WATER EFFICIENCY Employing techniques such as furrow irrigation and trash mulching, which locks in moisture, provides nutrients, forms a barrier against weeds, and can help insulate roots from the cold.
MECHANIZATION Using sugarcane trash shredding as biomass fuel for power generation at sugar mills.
MOBILE�VAN�THEATRE�(MVT)
MVT offers video training on sustainable agriculture practices to 8,000 farmers a month. The training modules cover water savings and efficiencies, social and human rights related to farming, and alternatives to the age-old practice of crop-residue burning, which is a health hazard and a source of pollution.

HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE AGRICULTURAL SUPPLY CHAIN. 
As part of a commitment to respect human rights across our value chain, The Coca-Cola Company initiated third-party studies to evaluate key human rights risks in agriculture. We began by looking at our top sugar sourcing countries. Since beginning the effort in 2013, we have published 21 country-specific studies focused on child labor, forced labor and land rights that have helped us better understand risks and overall systemic challenges and opportunities. These studies and their findings can be found on our website. In some markets, we were encouraged by the good practices underway to combat issues such as child labor. Overall, the risks identified through the studies were largely at the farm level, with the greatest risk appearing on small, independent farms. Third-party labor contractors were less likely to have proper policies and protections in place to prevent issues. We are using the findings from these studies and an earlier human rights assessment to improve working conditions through multi-stakeholder partnerships such as those now underway in India and Brazil.
Learn more about human rights in the sugar supply chain summary report we issued in 2019.
SUPPORTING HUMAN RIGHTS. 
Respect for human rights is foundational to our business and ingrained in our culture, guiding our interactions with employees, bottling partners, suppliers, customers, consumers and the communities we serve.
Our commitment starts with our own employees, making sure they have safe, supportive and respectful workplaces where the dignity of every associate is recognized. Our Human Rights Policy sets the framework for ensuring that we meet this commitment within our owned operations and those over which we have management control. Tools and training are provided to help our global operations abide by the policy. We encourage our employees to report any possible violations of the policy through multiple channels, including an ethics hotline.
Our suppliers and system partners are also expected to embrace responsible workplace practices. Our Supplier Guiding Principles (SGP), which are aligned with our Human Rights Policy, are included in all contractual agreements between The Coca-Cola Company and our direct and authorized suppliers. In 2019, we provided 36 training programs to bottlers, suppliers and auditors across the world to help them uphold these values.
1. SGP is part of all contractual agreements between The Coca-Cola Company and our direct and authorized suppliers. The Human Rights compliance metric reflects the performance of sites and suppliers critical to the development of the product, including company operations, bottling partners, co-packers and direct suppliers of ingredients, primary packaging and dispensing equipment. SGP audits may occur in other areas as well, such as trademarked marketing and promotional equipment; however, these are not included in the metric.
PARTNERING FOR PROGRESS. 
In 2019, we hosted our 11th Business and Human Rights conference in collaboration with the International Organization of Employers, the U.S. Council for International Business and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The conference provides a unique opportunity for candid discussions between business leaders and human rights experts on the human rights challenges companies can face within their operations and supply chains.
Our Human Rights Policy, our Supplier Guiding Principles and our Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles help ensure that, as a system, we create a positive impact in the communities where we operate, reduce social and environmental risks, and address issues when they arise. These policies and practices are aligned with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
TRACKING PROGRESS. 
In 2003, we set a goal that 98% of our company locations and system bottlers and 95% of our direct and authorized suppliers will validate compliance with our Human Rights Policy and our SGPs by the end of 2020. These policies are grounded in international standards and embody our company’s stated purpose of developing a sustainable business that makes a difference in people’s lives and in the communities where we operate. The metrics are consolidated and reported out to business units quarterly. As of Q4 2019, 93%1 of company-owned facilities, 92%1 of bottlers and 91%1 of suppliers reached compliance with our Human Rights Policy and SGPs. We are making a concerted effort to reach our 2020 goal and ensure in-scope sites complete an independent audit.

EMPOWERING WOMEN FOR A BETTER SHARED FUTURE. 
In 2010, we made a commitment to enable the economic empowerment of 5 million women entrepreneurs across our global value chain by 2020.
Women are significant contributors to the Coca-Cola system around the world1. And supporting their success is one of the many ways we are working toward a shared future that enables access to more equal opportunities. We sponsor programs that address specific business barriers that women entrepreneurs face. The programs meet women where they are—in their communities, businesses and online—providing access to business skills training, financial services and/ or assets, and mentoring networks.
Empowering women in the global economy is also critical to achieving the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, particularly those focused on gender equality, economic growth and ending poverty and hunger.
1. According to a baseline study conducted by our company in 2011, 86 percent of small retail shops globally are owned or operated by women.
INVESTING IN WOMEN AROUND THE WORLD. 
Our economic empowerment programs have been making a meaningful difference in 96 countries globally, with successes too varied to highlight in one annual report. One of our most effective partnerships is in Ukraine, where we created a networking and mentorship program that engaged nearly 4,000 participants in 2019. In neighboring Poland, more than 297,500 women were trained in 2019 through “Success is ME,” which aims to build selfesteem while strengthening business skills. Since 2010, in Kenya, our external partnership with the Women Enterprise Fund has provided more than 700,000 entrepreneurs to date with business skills training and loans to expand their businesses. And in Brazil, since 2010 Coletivo Youth has offered 11,700 young women life skills training and networking opportunities.
We are on track to reach our target of transforming the lives of 5 million women by the end of 2020, with over 4.6 million women empowered as of 2019.
See additional performance indicators in the Data Appendix.
WOMEN EMPOWERED THROUGH COMMUNITY WATER PARTNERSHIPS. 
Evidence shows that easy access to clean water gives women the time to engage in economic activity and increase their incomes. Beginning in 2020, our 5by20 framework will include “time savings” through water access as part of our empowerment commitment.
Across our markets, we collaborate with governments and NGO partners to build locally relevant programs and ultimately scale those that are most successful.

EMPOWERING WOMEN IN INVESTING. 
In 2019, we marked our 100th anniversary as a public company with a $1 million grant to Girls Who Invest, a non-profit dedicated to promoting diversity and inclusion in investment management with a focus on increasing the pipeline of women in the industry. The grant from The Coca-Cola Foundation will provide scholarships for approximately 40 women at U.S. colleges and universities to explore careers in investment management through training programs at one of three top-tier universities, followed by a six-week paid internship at one of more than 100 investment management firms in the U.S., Canada and the UK.
GIVING BACK TO OUR COMMUNITIES. 
At The Coca-Cola Company, we want a better shared future for the communities in which we live and work. We strive to have a positive impact, especially in times of need, and have pledged to give back 1% of our prior year’s operating income annually through our foundation and company donations.
In 2019, we contributed nearly $125 million ($88 million from The Coca-Cola Foundation and $37 million from The Coca-Cola Company) to directly benefit 294 organizations across 129 countries and territories. We focused in particular on funding for recycling, water and women’s empowerment efforts.
THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS. 
The Coca-Cola Foundation made a $1 million donation to the National Center for Civil and Human Rights that provided free admission to anyone who visited the civil rights landmark from January 28 through the end of February 2019. This allowed over 59,000 Atlanta residents and people visiting Atlanta for the Super Bowl the opportunity to learn more about how diversity, inclusion and unity are central to the story of modern Atlanta.

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND THE UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS. 
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were first launched in 2015 and are a core part of the agenda developed by the 193 member states of the United Nations to work toward the future we want, one where all people thrive within a healthy environment. The 17 goals—geared toward a 2030 timeframe— and their related 169 targets have become an important framework for companies to rally around as they address an array of complex, interrelated global issues.
We recognize that we cannot achieve any one of the SDGs on our own. Yet, as a global company with a wide supply chain and consumer reach, we have a significant role to play in meeting many of these ambitious aims. We have taken a closer look at where we can make direct contributions to the SDGs, whether through collaboration with our partners and industry peers, supplier engagement, or in other places where we have leverage to amplify our positive impacts.
The following table outlines the SDG goals and specific targets to which we most directly contribute, with links to more information.

INTRODUCING THE FIRST MARINE PLASTIC BOTTLE. 
In 2019, we produced the first-ever sample bottle using recovered and recycled marine plastics—demonstrating the potential for ocean debris to be recycled and reused in food and drink packaging. About 300 sample bottles were produced using 25% recycled marine plastic that was retrieved from the Mediterranean Sea and beaches—a small step for now, but the technology behind it has big potential. The bottle was produced using enhanced recycling technologies, which can recycle previously used plastics of any quality back to the high quality needed for food and drink packaging. The sample bottle was the result of a partnership between Coca-Cola, Indorama Ventures, Ioniqa Technologies and Mares Circulares.
2019 HIGHLIGHTS • Innovation within Trademark Coca-Cola led growth, leading to the best performance in eight years for the trademark. The non-sparkling portfolio continued to perform well, fueled by continued success in Fuze Tea.
• Acquired full ownership of C.H.I. Limited, an innovative, fast-growing leader in expanding beverage categories, including juices, value-added dairy and iced tea in West Africa.
• Coca-Cola Sweden announced it would be the first market in the world to transition to 100% recycled PET for all plastic bottles made in-country.
• Our bottler Coca-Cola European Partners was the greatest absolute value contributor to Fast-Moving Consumer Goods growth across Western Europe.

BOTTLING INVESTMENTS GROUP. 
In January 2006, our company-owned bottling operations were brought together to form the Bottling Investments Group (BIG) to ensure these operations receive the appropriate investments and expertise to foster long- term success. By strategically investing in select bottling operations and taking them under company ownership, we can utilize the leadership and resources of The Coca-Cola Company to drive long-term growth in critical markets. When an operation is stable and thriving, BIG’s goal is to find a qualified partner to assume operations and continue to invest in and grow the business. The Bottling Investments operating segment includes all company-owned or consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location.
2019 HIGHLIGHTS • Overall continued momentum as the majority of markets delivered solid growth with revenue growing ahead of volume.

Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures. 
The company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP” or referred to herein as “reported”). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions and in evaluating the company’s performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting.
For additional details regarding the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures below, see the company’s Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 30, 2020, February 14, 2019 and February 16, 2018.

61 THE COCA‑COLA COMPANY / 2019 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020 SUSTAINABILITY GOALS. 
The Coca-Cola Company Coca-Cola System 1. The calculation of progress toward our “drink in your hand” goal has been internally vetted using accepted and relevant scientific and technical methodologies, which are aligned with GHG Protocol Scopes 1, 2 and 3. Due to the nature of our franchise bottling system, our manufacturing emissions are normally split between Scopes 1 and 2 for company-owned facilities and Scope 3 for bottling partner facilities. However, in our “drink in your hand” calculations, we consider the full Coca-Cola system (including franchise bottling partners) in the calculation of our manufacturing, distribution and refrigeration emissions.
2. This number includes charitable grants awarded by The Coca-Cola Foundation and donations made by The Coca-Cola Company.
3. Peer-reviewed methodologies were used to calculate benefits per project and business unit. All replenish data is internally validated and verified; the equivalent volume for 100% Replenish rate (170.0 ML) is externally assured; Benefits fall into three categories: Watershed Health (219.9 ML), Productive Use (40.6 ML) and Community Access projects (13.1 ML).

63 THE COCA‑COLA COMPANY / 2019 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT. 
PACKAGING. 
The Coca-Cola Company Coca-Cola System 1. Our method to track our packaging collection rate against our 2020 goal focused on our predominant package types (glass bottles, steel and aluminum cans and PET plastic bottles), which make up approximately 85% of our portfolio. Because of new data that we have available to us, our 60% collection rate against our World Without Waste goals takes into account a more inclusive collection rate, representing all of our consumer packaging—including beverage cartons, juice boxes and pouches, etc.
2. Our percentage calculations of progress toward collection of 100% of the equivalent of the consumer packaging we sell has been internally vetted using relevant scientific and technical methodologies, but those methodologies are evolving as the industry learns more about calculating collection in different markets. We are working to improve our data collection and measuring systems. As systems and methodologies improve, we will revisit our prior estimates to ensure their accuracy and make any necessary corrections to our public reporting.
3. This year, we modified the methodology we use for calculating the amount of recycled material used in our cans and glass bottles. These changes are designed to integrate a more accurate dataset, including primary data where it is available. Moving forward, we expect that these numbers will continue to evolve as data sources improve, at the same time that we work to increase rates of recycled material use.

66 THE COCA‑COLA COMPANY / 2019 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT. 
WORKPLACE & SAFETY. 
The Coca-Cola Company Coca-Cola System 1. Corporate associates are included in the geographic area in which they work. Bottling Investments is an operating group with associates located in two of our four geographic operating groups. Numbers are approximate and as of December 31, 2019.
2. Some of the 2018 numbers listed in this chart differ slightly from what was reported in the 2018 Business & Sustainability Report due to a regrouping of the data represented here. We are also now including Bottling Investments Group (BIG) associates, who were previously not reported.
3. The total number of employees includes our acquisition of Costa Limited.
However, those employees are currently excluded in our 2019 reporting of LTIR.
4. In 2019, Employee Relations redefined how cases were captured in the case management tool of record. Therefore, the reported figure includes only those allegations that required investigations only as opposed to generalized questions raised to Employee Relations. Please note, however, that all questions presented to Employee Relations were answered even if the question did not warrant an investigation. While we previously reported on all cases and questions raised through our case management tool, we no longer capture that data. This helps us to ensure that we have more accurate visibility to annual Human Rights cases. This change accounts for the 2019 variance when compared to previous years.

TO�THE�MANAGEMENT�OF�THE�COCA-COLA�COMPANY. 
We have reviewed The Coca-Cola Company Schedule of Selected Sustainability Indicators (the Subject Matter) included in the Appendix and as presented in The Coca-Cola Company’s 2019 Business & Sustainability Report for the year ended December 31, 2019 in accordance with the Selected Sustainability Indicators Criteria set forth in Note 2 (the Criteria) included in the Appendix. The Coca-Cola Company’s management is responsible for the Subject Matter included in the Appendix, in accordance with the Criteria. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Subject Matter based on our review.
Our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) AT-C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements, and AT-C section 210, Review Engagements. Those standards require that we plan and perform our review to obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to the Subject Matter in order for it to be in accordance with the Criteria. A review consists principally of applying analytical procedures, making inquiries of persons responsible for the subject matter, obtaining an understanding of the data management systems and processes used to generate, aggregate and report the Subject Matter and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. A review is substantially less in scope than an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Subject Matter is in accordance with the Criteria, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. A review also does not provide assurance that we became aware of all significant matters that would be disclosed in an examination. We believe that our review provides a reasonable basis for our conclusion.
In performing our review, we have also complied with the independence and other ethical requirements set forth in the Code of Professional Conduct and applied the Statements on Quality Control Standards established by the AICPA.
As described in Note 3 of the Appendix, non-financial information is subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such data. The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary.
Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the Schedule of Selected Sustainability Indicators for the year ended December 31, 2019, in order for it to be in accordance with the Criteria.

70 THE COCA‑COLA COMPANY / 2019 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT. 
APPENDIX�–�SCHEDULE�OF�SELECTED�SUSTAINABILITY�INDICATORS. 
For the year ended December 31, 2019. 
Note 1: Scope of Reporting. 
The Coca-Cola global business system is composed of the Coca-Cola company (TCCC) and 225 bottling partners. TCCC markets, manufactures and sells beverage concentrates, syrups and finished sparkling soft drinks and other nonalcoholic beverages. The bottling partners manufacture, package, merchandise and distribute the final beverages to customers and/or consumers. TCCC and its bottling partners together are collectively known as the Coca-Cola system (TCCS), or simply “system.” TCCC does not own, manage, or control most local bottling companies.
Although the system is not a single entity from a legal or managerial perspective, TCCC strives to positively influence environmental activities and policies throughout the bottling system and to become more transparent by reporting information from both company-owned operations and the broader system. Contract manufacturers are also used to manufacture and distribute Coca-Cola brands.
In accordance with TCCC’s policies and procedures, newly acquired facilities have up to two years to begin reporting data for inclusion in the external reporting of the Selected Sustainability Indicators.
INDICATOR NAME SCOPE UNIT REPORTED VALUE. 
Greenhouse gas emissions (manufacturing activities) The Coca-Cola System CO2e emissions in millions of metric tonnes 5.56. 
Water replenish Projects funded by The Coca-Cola Company, The Coca-Cola Foundation and/or The Coca-Cola System. 
Liters of water replenished per liters of finished beverages sold More than 100%
Water use ratio The Coca-Cola System Liters of water used per liter of product produced 1.85. 
Lost Time Incident Rate The Coca-Cola Company Number of lost time incidents multiplied by 200,000 and divided by the number of hours worked 0.32.

71 THE COCA‑COLA COMPANY / 2019 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT. 
INDICATOR NAME CRITERIA. 
Greenhouse gas emissions (manufacturing activities)
The criteria can be found in the “Carbon Accounting Manual.” This includes scope 1 and 2 carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from manufacturing and scope 3 CO2e emissions from franchises. Emissions from standalone (i.e., not co-located) warehouses, distribution centers and offices (based on emissions being lower than the threshold of five percent of total Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions) are excluded, CO2 loss during production and AC/Chiller are excluded.
Water replenish The intent of the replenish program is to develop a global portfolio of Community Water Partnership (CWP) projects that yield an annual volumetric water benefit equivalent to the company’s annual global sales volume. Water replenish is defined as the ratio of water safely provided to communities and to nature by the community water partnership portfolio divided by sales volume of company beverage products as disclosed in the 2019 10-K.* Volumetric project benefits are quantified using TCCC’s peer reviewed methodology as outlined in the Corporate Water Stewardship: Achieving a Sustainable Balance paper published in the Journal of Management and Sustainability in November 2013. There are three primary CWP project types: 1. Watershed Protection and Restoration 2. Water Access and Sanitation 3. Water for Productive Use. 
While public education, awareness programs and business engagement on water policy reform are critical responses to water risks and challenges, the water replenish contributions from such efforts cannot reliably be quantified and are not included in the water replenish indicator. As many replenish projects are co-financed with partners, TCCC claims the portion of the total water benefits equivalent to the company’s cost share for the project. TCCC also claims the annual water benefits from each project following a benefit duration framework of 15 years as long as the projects remain in productive service.
For individual projects with benefits greater than 5% of global sales volume, benefits are capped at 5% of global sales volume or 100% of the business unit sales volume, whichever is greater.
Water use ratio Water use ratio (efficiency) is defined as liters of water used per liter of product produced. Total water used is the total of all water used by the Coca-Cola system in all global production facilities and co-located distribution centers, from all sources, including municipal, well, surface water, and collected rain water. This includes water used for: production; water treatment; boiler makeup; cooling (contact and non-contact); cleaning and sanitation; backwashing filters; irrigation; washing trucks and other vehicles; kitchen or canteen; toilets and sinks; and fire control. This does not include return water or non-branded bulk water donated to the community. Liters of product produced include all production, not just saleable products.

72 THE COCA‑COLA COMPANY / 2019 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT. 
INDICATOR NAME CRITERIA. 
Lost time incident rate The Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) represents the number of Lost Time Incidents (LTI) per 100 employees. Total LTI is multiplied by 200,000 (100 full time equivalent employees working 40 hours per week for 50 weeks) then divided by the number of hours worked for the reporting period.
Scope: The scope of reporting is limited to self-reported data collected for TCCC and active company-owned or controlled production facilities, distribution centers, offices, laboratories and route-to-market (fleet) operations as of December 31, 2019.
Lost Time Incident: A LTI is a self-reported work-related injury or illness, including fatality that results in one or more Lost Days. TCCC’s LTIR was determined as of April 8, 2020, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as a minor incident developing into an LTI over time could result in additional LTIs.
Lost day: A Lost Day occurs when, in the opinion of the medical professional of record, the employee’s workrelated injury or illness prevents the person from being able to work. The first counted Lost Day is the first day following the injury, regardless of whether it was a scheduled workday, and ends when the person is able, in the opinion of the medical professional of record, to return to work, leaves employment, or reaches 180 Lost Days.
Hours worked: The hours worked include total hours worked during the reporting period by all employees. This excludes hours not worked, such as vacation, holidays, or absences.
Employees: Employees include all hourly, salary and temporary employees who are on the payroll of the company (as well as non-payroll contractors and temporary employees for whom facility or fleet management provides day-to-day supervision of their work and provides the details, means, methods and processes by which the work objective is accomplished).
Uncertainties in reported LTIR: LTIR is subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such data. The number of LTIs is based upon employees self-reporting work-related injuries or illnesses to TCCC which may be affected by culture, societal norms and/or regulations. To the extent a LTI is not self-reported, it would not be included in the LTIR calculation.
Note 3: Measurement Uncertainties. 
Nonfinancial information is subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such data. The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary.
* Sales volume is measured in number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners (“Coca-Cola system”) to customers as reported by TCCC and the bottlers to TCCC and disclosed in the 2019 10-K. A ‘‘unit case’’ is a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces (5.678 liters) of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). Refer to TCCC 2019 10-K for additional information regarding the 2019 measured Unit Cases.

73 THE COCA‑COLA COMPANY / 2019 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT. 
In a separate PDF document available here, we index the contents of this report to several important reporting frameworks and standards: the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and the United Nations Guiding Principles Reporting Framework (UNGPRF).
GRI provides a globally recognized framework for companies to measure and communicate their environmental, economic, social and governance performance. We prepared this report in accordance with the 2016 GRI Standards: Core option. This is the ninth consecutive year that these reporting principles have informed our reporting process, and we assess our progress against these guidelines. In this report, the GRI General Disclosures are solely for The Coca-Cola Company. For all other indicators, the scope is identified in the referenced documents. Beyond reporting on performance indicators required by the GRI, we report on additional indicators important to our broad range of stakeholders.
This report also meets the requirements of the UNGC Advanced Communication on Progress and aligns with the UNGPRF, which addresses reporting on human rights. Please see p. 45–46 for information on where our programs most directly contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
We review our reporting regularly and aim to be as responsive as possible to our stakeholders’ feedback.
