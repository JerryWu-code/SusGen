                    "output": "Direct Operations:\n Risk management at Wolfspeed is a process undertaken by all functions within the business, including a review of risks related to ffnancial and market performance, operational performance, emergency preparedness and response, environment, health and safety compliance, among other areas. Wolfspeed assesses and prioritizes risks based on impacts to our business and products, our employees, the communities in which we operate, and our customers. Wolfspeed also assesses and prioritizes risks based on regulatory impacts. In addition, Wolfspeed has established a formal Enterprise Risk Management program in order to identify, assess, prioritize and manage key enterprise risks. Climate-related risks and opportunities are discussed and addressed as part of this program. \n Our Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess both domestic and international business risks, ffnancial risks, and market risks. These risks, as well as environmental compliance risks, are reviewed as part of ffnancial disclosure requirements (e.g., US SEC Form 10-K). Situationally, departments including Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations, among others, assess Wolfspeed-speciffc physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. Potential physical climate change risks to major facilities have been reviewed, including sea level rise ffooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered. We have also considered raw material sourcing issues, and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use $1 million USD to establish a threshold for substantive ffnancial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n Wolfspeed uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Wolfspeed\u2019s top management have been interviewed to discuss which aspects are most relevant for Wolfspeed\u2019s future success. We also conducted outreach to external stakeholders (e.g., customers, suppliers) to understand which aspects they believe are most important for Wolfspeed\u2019s future success. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Wolfspeed\u2019s Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Wolfspeed\u2019s ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those that impact or are impacted by climate change. ISO 14001 deffnes an environmental aspect as an element of an organization\u2019s activities, products, or services that has or may have an impact on the environment. Our signiffcant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certiffcation are determined using a ranking system. Each environmental aspect (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions, energy usage) is ranked from 0 through 4 based on each of the following criteria: severity, magnitude, probability, frequency, controllability, duration, employee concerns, community concerns, boundaries, business impact, and regulatory. Each aspect receives a total score and the highest scores designate what our signiffcant impacts are, which we focus on in more detail in our environmental management systems.\n We have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also established a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact in support of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy. Refer to the Sustainability Goals section of this report for more information about our current sustainability goals and targets.\nUpstream:\nSituationally, departments including Environment, Health & Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations (Procurement), and Investor Relations, among others, assess Wolfspeed speciffc physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. During our climate-related risk assessments, we have considered the affect climate change could have on the suppliers of our raw materials. We rely on global suppliers for raw materials, who depending on their location, may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In an instance where Wolfspeed depends on a number of limited source suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change- related risks could affect Wolfspeed. For example, chronic drought or ffooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption. We use $1 million USD to establish a threshold for substantive ffnancial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nWolfspeed also assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department also manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help Wolfspeed manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, Wolfspeed seeks to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where Wolfspeed conducts business, which helps to reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream: Situationally, departments including Environment, Health & Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations, among others, assess Wolfspeed-speciffc physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. During our climate-related risk assessments we have considered the affect climate change could have on our business downstream. We feel that climate change is a potential opportunity for us because our products are speciffcally designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions comparedto incumbent technologies. However, since climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, there are commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use $1 million USD to establish a threshold for substantive ffnancial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nWolfspeed also assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages Wolfspeed \u2019s climaterelated transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, our reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. Wolfspeed assesses market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shiffed our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles).",

Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. As such, we enable our customers to lower their GHG emissions by provid ing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solu tions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we man aged to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI for example has been established with the priority focus on decentraliza tion, decarbonization as well as energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongo ing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, pho tovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sus tainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For example, have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2. With respect to our own operation, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral in 2030. This year we managed to halve our emissions com pared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduced potential carbon taxational risk on our op erations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce aforementioned risk upstream  CLIMATE ACTION and SUPPLY CHAIN SECTION.Concerning potential physical risk, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics as well as trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or ex penditure as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protec tion concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to iden tify geographical areas where we pay special atten tion at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our German sites Penig, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved ef fective, when our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by in creasing overall impacts of natural disasters. Jointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate on a yearly basis 80% of our insured val ue with respect to fire safety but also natural catastro phes, e.g., storms, floods, hurricanes. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe whereas some sites in the U.S., Philippines, or Japan are ex posed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the iden tified sites such as installation of flood barriers, thick ening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.This process is complementary to the implementation of the Siemens Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally rele vant site must perform a risk assessment. This in cludes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks such their water stress level, exposure to flood ing, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our Siemens Water Tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom up analysis. In fiscal 2020 we had analyzed 97% of locations.  One example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water man agement system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.In addition to our own operation, natural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low, due to our diversified sup plier base, worldwide operations and a limited num ber of Siemens facilities concentrated in any particu lar region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we ana lyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain op erations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigat ing upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indi cators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises.",

                    "output": "We have implemented and coordinated a set of risk management and control systems which support us in the early recognition of developments that could jeopardize the continuity of our business. The most important of these systems include our enter prise-wide processes for strategic planning and man agement reporting. Strategic planning is intended to support us in considering potential risks well in ad vance of major business decisions, while manage ment reporting is intended to enable us to monitor such risks more closely as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management. Accord ingly, if deficits are detected, it is possible to adopt appropriate measures for their elimination. This co ordination of processes and procedures is intended to help ensure that the Managing Board and the Su pervisory Board are fully informed about significant risks in a timely manner.\nRisk management at Siemens builds on a comprehen sive, interactive, and management-oriented Enter prise Risk Management (ERM) approach that is inte grated into the organization and that addresses both risks and opportunities. Our ERM approach is based on the globally accepted COSO Standard (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Com mission) \u201cEnterprise Risk Management \u2013 Integrating with Strategy and Performance\u201d (2017) and the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) Stan dard 31000 (2018) and is adapted to Siemens re quirements. The frameworks connect the ERM pro cess with our financial reporting process and our internal control system. They consider a company\u2019s strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of its busi ness operations, the reliability of its financial report ing, and compliance with relevant laws and regula tions to be equally important.Our ERM process aims for early identification andevaluation of, and response regarding, risks and op portunities that could materially affect the achieve ment of our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, address ing risks and opportunities remaining after the exe cution of existing control measures. If risks have al ready been considered in plans, budgets, forecasts, or the consolidated financial statements (e.g., as a provision or risk contingency), they are supposed to be incorporated with their financial impact in the entity\u2019s business objectives. As a consequence, only additional risks arising from the same subject (e.g., deviations from business objectives, different impact perspectives) should be considered. In order to pro vide a comprehensive view of our business activities, risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way combining elements of both top-down and bot tom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle; we complement this periodic report ing with an ad-hoc reporting process that aims to escalate critical issues in a timely manner. Relevant risks and opportunities are prioritized in terms of im pact and likelihood, considering different impact perspectives, including business objectives, reputa tion and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supple mented by workshops with the respective manage ments of our organizational units. The top-down el ement ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant. Reported risks and opportunities are analyzed regarding potential cumu lative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizations mentioned above.Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the hierarchical level of responsi bility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. In a first step, assuming responsi bility for a specific risk or opportunity involves choos ing one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies with respect to risks areavoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance of the relevant risk. Our general response strategy with re spect to opportunities is to \u201cseize\u201d the relevant oppor tunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures have to be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management. Accordingly, we have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates by engaging in hedging activities. Regarding our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including pro visional acceptances during project execution and complemented by clearly defined approval processes, assists us in identifying and responding to project risks at an early stage, even before the bidding phase. Fur thermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential cases of damage and liability risks in order to reduce our exposure to such risks and to avoid or minimize potential losses. Among others, we address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and cus tomer demand by closely monitoring macroeconom ic conditions and developments in relevant industries, and by adjusting capacity and implementing cost-re duction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary. Worldwide there are risks from the transmission of infectious agents from animals to humans, from humans to humans, and in other ways. Epidemic, pandemic, or other spread pat terns such as bioterrorism threaten to cause high disease rates in different countries, regions, or conti nents. We constantly check information from the World Health Organization (WHO), the American and European Centers of Disease Control, the German Robert Koch Institute and other institutions in order to be able to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible.",

In order to provide greater senior executive involvement and holistic oversight of ESG matters material to the Group, in 2020 a Group ESG Committee was established, superseding the previous ESG Executive Committee. The Committee is chaired by the Group Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, in his role as ESG sponsor. Membership of the Committee includes the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, the Group HR Director, and senior representatives from the Group\u2019s asset owner and asset management business units, including, from 1 January 2021, the Chief Executives of Eastspring and PACS (Prudential\u2019s Singapore business). One of the Group ESG Committee\u2019s responsibilities is to oversee the Group\u2019s progress towards fulfilling our commitment to report against the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In 2020, the Group ESG Committee reported to the Board through the Group Nomination & Governance Committee. The Board recognises that the next 12 to 18 months will be critical for the embedding of the ESG Strategic Framework within the Group, as well as for the progress of related matters such as the development and embedding of the Group\u2019s purpose and values, progressing diversity and inclusion (D&I) priorities, and building upon employee engagement activities. Therefore, in early 2021 the Board established a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group, to be chaired by Alice Schroeder and comprising four Non-executive Directors, in order to ensure an appropriate level of Board engagement in, and oversight of, these matters during this critical period. Our Group Governance Manual (GGM) sets out the policies and procedures by which the Group operates. It establishes standards for managing possible ESG issues across the Group. The GGM is subject to a formal content review each year, taking into consideration both internal and external factors. As part of the Governance, Risk Management & Internal Control \u2013 Annual Statement of Compliance certification, all businesses across the Group assess their compliance position against each of the requirements set out in the Group Code of Business Conduct, Policies and Delegated Authorities. Any instances of GGM non-compliance identified by the businesses through their annual attestation are assessed by the Group policy owners and reported to the Group Audit Committee.\nWe believe that the new strategic ESG framework and the long-term goals to decarbonise the investment portfolio and support an inclusive transition are an important way in which we can meet to meet stakeholder expectations and fulfil our fiduciary obligations. It will reduce the Group\u2019s exposure to asset risk \u2013 which includes transition risk \u2013 over time, while also contributing to efforts to decarbonise the global economy. Recognising that transition risk represents the nearest-term and most impactful financial risk to the Group, the Group Risk function undertook an initial transition risk analysis on insurance assets managed in segregated portfolios by the Group\u2019s asset managers. This focused on investments where Prudential both maintains direct control of the mandate and exerts some influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to the overall carbon footprint metrics of the asset book and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded.

Within each of these, specific differentiating focus areas have been identified where it is believed there is an opportunity for Prudential to make a meaningful impact, and as such greater focus will be placed on these differentiators.We believe that the new strategic ESG framework and the long-term goals to decarbonise the investment portfolio and support an inclusive transition are an important way in which we can meet to meet stakeholder expectations and fulfil our fiduciary obligations.

These emerging markets have a greater reliance on fossil fuels in their generation mix, and less developed f inancial systems.This means that the energy transition across the region is likely to proceed at a slower pace than for advanced economies as reflected in the countries\u2019 Nationally Determined Contributions, as required by the Paris Agreement. This point was highlighted by Mr Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). Speaking at a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on 13 October2020, Mr Menon noted that \u2018Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.\u2019For Prudential, this means that, while we are committed to an objective to decarbonise our investment portfolio, we are mindful of the need to implement the strategy in a way that acknowledges the nature of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition in a fair manner. Our support for an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders.We recognise the importance of coalition building in delivering an inclusive transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we work with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition.

This focused on investments where Prudential both maintains direct control of the mandate and exerts some influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool.

Scenario analysis will be an important area of focus as we plan to move it into our mainstream risk management processes during 2021 and to begin internally reporting findings within Group and business unit level management information. As we further investigate how climate risk impacts our business in the long term, we aim to operationalise and to continue to increase the use of scenario testing. We plan to voluntarily run scenario tests emerging from regulators, such as the Bank of England\u2019s exploratory climate risk scenario for banks and insurers in 2021.

We are in the process of assessing similar suitable targets in respect of the carbon emissions from our investments, given their importance within our overall emissions profile, and our overarching strategic commitment to decarbonising our investment portfolio. In the interim, we continue to increase our level of ambition in relation to our own emissions footprint. This year we have set new and stretching targets for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, with the aim of becoming net carbon neutral across these two scopes by the end of 2030.

These are used to improve our understanding of our risk exposures for risk management and business decision making. Given the challenges on data sourcing and processes, there has been an impact on certain climate disclosures. \u2013 Climate scenario analysis was used as a risk assessment tool to provide insights on the long-term effects of transition and physical risks across our corporate and retail banking portfolios, as well as our own operations. \u2013 Our sustainable finance ambition has enabled sustainable infrastructure and energy systems, promoted decarbonisation efforts across the real economy, and enhanced investor capital through sustainable investment. Relevant short, medium, and long term time horizons \u2013 We aim to achieve net zero in our financed emissions by 2050, and in our own operations and supply chain by 2030. \u2013 We aim to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn of sustainable finance and investment for our customers in their transition to net zero and a sustainable future. \u2013 We have taken these time horizons into our consideration. Our assessment of climate risks covers three distinct time periods: short term is up to 2025, medium term is 2026 to 2035; and long term is 2036 to 2050. Transition or physical climate-related issues identified \u2013 We enhanced our transition and physical risk questionnaire and scoring tool, which helps us to assess and improve our understanding of the impact of transition and physical risk on our customers\u2019 business models, and used it for our corporate clients in high climate transition risk sectors. \u2013 We are supporting our customers in their transition through our sustainable finance and investment ambition. Our sustainable finance data dictionary includes a detailed definition of contributing activities. \u2013 In the UK, in line with our retail portfolio, the main perils that drive potential credit losses relate to coastal, river and surface water flooding, although the impacts from these perils are not expected to cause significant damages. Around 20% of our financed properties are in London, and most are protected by the Thames Barrier. Risks and opportunities by sector and/or geography \u2013 We identified six key sectors where our wholesale credit customers have the highest exposure to climate transition risk, based on their carbon emissions. These are automotive, chemicals, construction and building materials, metals and mining, oil and gas, and power and utilities. \u2013 We continued to improve our identification and assessment of climate risk within our retail mortgage portfolio, with increased investments in physical risk data and enhancements to our internal risk assessment capabilities and models. We completed detailed analysis for the UK, Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia, which together represent 73.8% of balances of the global mortgage portfolio. \u2013 Opportunities include sustainable finance, sustainable investment and sustainable infrastructure. For a detailed breakdown of our sustainable finance progress by geography, see the ESG Data Pack. Concentrations of credit exposure to carbon-related assets (supplemental guidance for banks) \u2013 We report our exposure to the six high transition risk sectors in the wholesale portfolio. For details, see the ESG Data Pack. \u2013 Since 2020, we have rolled out the questionnaire so that it included our largest customers in the next highest climate transition risk sectors: agriculture, industrials, real estate, and transportation. This was done across a larger geographical scope. Climate-related risks (transition and physical) in lending and other financial intermediary business activities (supplemental guidance for banks) \u2013 As a result of our climate scenario analysis, our largest and most impacted sectors \u2013 power and utilities, construction and building materials, and chemicals \u2013 are subject to increased levels of transition risks due to their ongoing exposure to higher carbon-emitting activities. \u2013 HSBC Asset Management is increasingly considering both physical and transition risks. As a result, it integrated ESG and climate analysis to help ensure that risks faced by companies are considered throughout the investment decision-making process.Impact on strategy, business, and financial planning \u2013 Transition to net zero represents one of our four strategic pillars. We aim to be net zero in our operations and supply chain by 2030 and in our financed emissions by 2050. \u2013 Scenario analysis supports our strategy by assessing our position under a range of climate scenarios. It helps to build our awareness of climate change, plan for the future and meet our growing regulatory requirements. We acknowledge that our systems, processes, controls and governance are developing. \u2013 We continue to develop how we produce our climate scenario analysis exercises so that we can have a more comprehensive understanding of climate headwinds, risks and opportunities that will support our strategic planning and actions. \u2013 We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of climate-related issues on financial planning, and particularly the impact of climate-related issues on our financial performance and financial position. In addition, we have considered the impact of climate-related issues on our businesses, strategy, and financial planning, but not specifically in relation to acquisitions/divestments. Due to transitional challenges such as process limitations, we do not disclose the climate-related impact in these areas. We expect to further enhance our disclosure and processes in relation to acquisitions/divestments in the medium term. \u2013 We have considered the impact of climate-related issues on our businesses, strategy, and financial planning. Our access to capital may be impacted by reputational concerns as a result of climate action or inaction. In addition, if we are perceived to mislead stakeholders on our business activities or if we fail to achieve our stated net zero ambitions, we could face greenwashing risk resulting in significant reputational damage, impacting our revenue generating ability and potentially our access to capital. Impact on products and services \u2013 We aim to help our customers\u2019 transition to net zero and a sustainable future through providing and facilitating between $750bn and $1tn of sustainable finance and investment by 2030. Impact on supply chain and/or value chain \u2013 We will continue to engage with our supply chain through CDP, and through direct discussions with our suppliers on how they can further support our transition to net zero. \u2013 We also have significant responsibilities in relation to asset ownership by our insurance business, employee pension plans and asset management business. Impact on adaptation and mitigation activities \u2013 In October 2020, we announced our ambition to reduce our energy consumption by 50% by 2030, against a 2019 baseline. As part of our ambition to achieve 100% renewable power across our operations by 2030, we continue to look for opportunities to procure green energy in each of our markets. A key challenge remains the limited opportunity to pursue power purchase agreements or green tariffs in key markets due to regulations. Impact on operations \u2013 Climate change poses a physical risk to the buildings that we occupy as an organisation, including our offices, retail branches and data centres. \u2013 We use stress testing to evaluate the potential for impact to our owned or leased premises. Our scenario stress test, conducted in 2022, analysed how seven different climate change-related hazards \u2013 comprising coastal inundation, extreme heat, extreme winds, wildfires, riverine flooding, soil movement due to drought, and surface water flooding \u2013 could impact 500 of our critical and important buildings. Impact on investment in research and development \u2013 Our Climate Solutions Partnership is a five-year $100m philanthropic initiative that aims to identify and remove barriers to scale for climate change solutions. Working with the World Resources Institute, WWF and over 50 local partners, our support focuses on start-up companies developing carbon-cutting technologies, nature-based solutions, renewable energy initiatives in Asia and the WWF-led Asia Sustainable Palm Oil Links programme. How we are striving to meet investor expectations \u2013 During Board meetings, the Directors continued to balance discussions on the Group\u2019s performance, emerging risks and duties to shareholders, while remaining conscious of responsibilities to support communities and help customers. \u2013 In 2022, the Board approved an update to the thermal coal phase-out policy. It also approved the publication of an updated energy policy. Transition plan to a low-carbon economy \u2013 We have committed to publish our own climate transition plan in 2023. This plan will outline, in one place, not only our commitments, targets and approach to net zero across the sectors and markets we serve, but how we are transforming our organisation to embed net zero and finance the transition.",

It helps to build our awareness of climate change, plan for the future and meet our growing regulatory requirements. \u2013 In 2022, we delivered our first internal climate scenario analysis exercise where we used four scenarios that were designed to articulate our view of the range of potential outcomes for global climate change. The analysis considered the key regions in which we operate, and assessed the impact on our balance sheet between the 2022 and 2050 time period. Key drivers of performance and how these have been taken into account \u2013 Climate scenario analysis allows us to model how different potential climate pathways may affect our customers and portfolios, particularly in respect of credit losses. Under the Current Commitments scenario, we expect moderate levels of losses relating to transition risks. However, the rise in global warming will lead to increasing levels of physical risk losses in later years.Scenarios used and how they factored in government policies \u2013 The scenario assumptions used for our climate stress testing exercise include varying levels of governmental climate policy changes, macroeconomic factors and technological developments. However, these scenarios rely on the development of technologies that are still unproven, such as global hydrogen production to decarbonise aviation and shipping. For details of the assumptions, see the ESG Data Pack. How our strategies may change and adapt \u2013 The nature of the scenarios, our developing capabilities, and limitations of the analysis lead to outcomes that are indicative of climate change headwinds, although they are not a direct forecast. \u2013 Developments in climate science, data, methodology, and scenario analysis techniques will help us shape our approach further. We therefore expect this view of risk to change over time. \u2013 We plan to continue to enhance our capabilities for climate scenario analysis and use the results for decision making, particularly in respect of strategy, by using the range of scenario analysis outcomes to shape our strategy across business and regions. \u2013 We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of transition and physical risk quantitatively, due to transitional challenges including data limitations and evolving science and methodologies.",

Process \u2013 We have integrated climate risk into our existing risk taxonomy, and incorporated it within the risk management framework through the policies and controls for the existing risks where appropriate. We also recognise that we require enhanced capabilities and new sources of data. \u2013 We consider greenwashing to be an important emerging risk that is likely to increase over time, as we look to develop capabilities and products to achieve our net zero commitments, and work with our clients to help them transition to a low-carbon economy. We also recognise that green finance taxonomies are not consistent globally, and evolving taxonomies and practices could result in revisions in our sustainable finance reporting going forward. \u2013 We also use stress testing and scenario analysis to assess how these climate risks will impact our customers, business and infrastructure. Integration into policies and procedures \u2013 In 2022, we incorporated climate considerations into our UK mortgage origination process for our retail mortgage business and new money request process for our key wholesale businesses. We also continued to enhance our climate risk scoring tool, which will enable us to assess our customers\u2019 exposures to climate risk. We also published our updated energy policy, covering the oil and gas, power and utilities, hydrogen, renewables, nuclear and biomass sectors, as well as updated our thermal coal phase-out policy after its initial publication in 2021. \u2013 We are integrating climate risk into the policies, processes and controls across many areas of our organisation, and we will continue to update these as our climate risk management capabilities mature over time. Consider climate-related risks in traditional banking industry risk categories (supplementary guidance for banks) \u2013 In 2022, we expanded our scope to consider climate risk impacts on our other risk types (including treasury risk and traded risk) in our risk taxonomy. \u2013 We also analysed in our internal scenario analysis exercise how climate risks impact how we manage other risks within our organisation, including credit risk, and on an exploratory basis: market, operational, liquidity, insurance, and pension risks.",

                    "output": "TSMC conducts financial impact analysis on the top three physical risks, transition risks, and climate opportunities in compliance with TCFD recommendations to formulate strategies to mitigate risks and explore opportunities for the Company's reference. Financial impact analysis of climaterelated risks focuses mainly on marketand technology-related costs to remove carbon emissions along the pathway to Net Zero Emissions by 2050. For example, expenses on energy conservation or carbon reduction facilities, paying for more expensive renewable energy or RECs, buying carbon credits, and additional expenses on renewable energy or carbon credits because of uncertainties in the development of new energy saving and carbon reduction technologies. Physical risks mainly focus on growing electricity costs because of chronic climate changes from rising temperatures and investments in strengthening the Company's climate resilience. For example, the costs to combat drought include expenses for building water reclamation systems, using reclaimed water, and purchasing backup water sources. As for floods and strong wind, also considered acute climate change disasters, TSMC has already designed flood prevention systems into new TSMC facilities and will therefore not be calculating its financial impact. TSMC has also estimated the cost of the Company's reputation from failing to meet net zero emission targets though there is no globally recognized approach to estimate such financial impact. The financial impact of 1% revenue was a consensus reached by experts after discussions and assessments. The estimated financial impact from climate opportunities includes reduced costs from increased energy and water use efficiency and diverse water sources as well as additional income from providing low-carbon products and services such as 7nm or more advanced processes, Power Management IC (PMICs), and ultralow power (ULP) ICs. Analysis results show that developing low-carbon products and services presents the greatest opportunity for positive financial impacts as demands for low-carbon products of 7nm and more advanced manufacturing process continue to grow.",

                    "output": "In compliance with TCFD recommendations, TSMC has evaluated the impact of various GHG emission controls on TSMC operations and the supply chain for certain transition and physical risks. TSMC has considered the outcomes when determining the resiliency of strategies and has also referred to the latest physical science basis, published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to develop its own climate scenarios. In addition, TSMC has also included potential growth in carbon emissions from growing TSMC operations and new facilities as well as existing carbon reduction actions into general evaluations to analyze the potential financial impacts of climate risks. In the past, TSMC evaluated climate risks solely using the worst-case scenario, but the future of climate change is highly unpredictable. As such, TSMC has opted to evaluate climate risks across several scenarios this year to help map out and communicate operations strategies internally and give comprehensive insights into climate trends over the mid-tolong term. Climate Scenario Selection In terms of transition risks, countries have now reached a consensus, agreeing that carbon pricing schemes are a necessary policy to achieve net zero emissions. TSMC referenced World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO), an IEA report commonly used by companies around the world, and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to conduct climate scenario analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing then serves as the basis for TSMC to evaluate the impacts of carbon pricing schemes on TSMC locations in different countries. In terms of physical risks, TSMC referenced the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) published by IPCC in 2021 and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes in the future. TSMC also adopted the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) to derive GHG emissions under different social and economic landscapes. TSMC's impact analysis on physical risks covers climate change evaluations across every region of the globe and provides detailed impact analysis to TSMC locations and suppliers around the world through downscaling analysis.",
