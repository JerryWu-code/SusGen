Our ERM approach is based on globally accepted standards, such as the COSO Standard \"Enterprise Risk Management \u2013 Integrating with Strategy and Performance\" (2017) and the ISO Standard 31000 (2018). We adapt these frameworks to our specific needs.\n\nThe ERM process is connected to our financial reporting process and our internal control system. These frameworks consider our strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of our business operations, the reliability of our financial reporting, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be of equal importance. ERM is based on a net risk approach and covers risks and opportunities that remain after the execution of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on their impact and likelihood.\n\nResponsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities. The level of responsibility depends on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. The time horizon for assessment is typically three years, but we also monitor emerging risks and opportunities beyond three years up to a century using our long-term forward-looking ERM feature. Assessment is based on impact and velocity.\n\nOur ERM system enables us to identify, assess, prioritize, and manage risks and opportunities in a systematic and integrated manner. It helps us to align our risk management efforts with our business strategy and objectives, and to ensure that we have the necessary controls in place to mitigate risks effectively. By integrating climate-related risks into our ERM system, we can better understand the potential impacts of climate change on our business and take appropriate actions to mitigate those risks.\n\nOur ERM approach is consistent with globally recognized risk management frameworks and is designed to be flexible enough to adapt to our specific business context and risk profile. It is an ongoing process that requires regular review and updating to ensure that it remains effective in managing the risks and opportunities facing our company.\n\nOur ERM process is integrated with our financial reporting process and our internal control system, ensuring that risk management is a core component of our business operations. We believe that effective risk management is essential for the long-term sustainability and success of our business.\n\nOur ERM radar feature allows us to monitor emerging risks and opportunities beyond the typical three-year time horizon, up to a century. This long-term perspective enables us to identify and prepare for potential risks and opportunities that may not be immediately apparent but could have significant impacts on our business in the future.\n\nOur approach to ERM is based on a net risk approach, which means that we focus on the residual risk after controls have been implemented. We prioritize risks and opportunities based on their impact and likelihood, and assign responsibilities accordingly. We regularly review and update our risk assessments to ensure that they remain accurate and relevant.\n\nOur ERM system is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing us to respond effectively to changing risks and opportunities. It is an integral part of our business strategy and operations, and is essential for ensuring the long-term sustainability and success of our company."

        "output": "Our company has implemented and coordinated a set of risk management and control systems to support the early recognition of developments that could jeopardize our business continuity. These systems include enterprise-wide processes for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning helps us consider potential risks before major business decisions, while management reporting enables us to monitor such risks more closely as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management. If deficiencies are detected, appropriate measures can be adopted for their elimination. This coordination of processes and procedures is intended to help ensure that our Managing Board and Supervisory Board are fully informed about significant risks in a timely manner.\n\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-oriented, integrated into the organization, and addresses both risks and opportunities. It is based on globally accepted standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO Standard 31000, and is adapted to our requirements. The frameworks connect the risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system. They consider our strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of our business operations, the reliability of our financial reporting, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important.\n\nOur risk management process aims for early identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievement of our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues in a timely manner.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized in terms of impact and likelihood, considering different impact perspectives, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed regarding potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational units mentioned above. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the hierarchical level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. In a first step, assuming responsibility for a specific risk or opportunity involves choosing one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies with respect to risks are avoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance of the relevant risk. Our general response strategy with respect to opportunities is to \"seize\" the relevant opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures have to be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates by engaging in hedging activities. Regarding our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and complemented by clearly defined approval processes, assists us in identifying and responding to project risks at an early stage, even before the bidding phase. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential cases of damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure to such risks and to avoid or minimize potential losses.\n\nWe address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries and adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary.\n\nOur company constantly checks information from reputable sources, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the American and European Centers for Disease Control, and the German Robert Koch Institute, to be able to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible. We have established procedures to respond effectively to such risks, including communication with employees, customers, and stakeholders, as well as the implementation of necessary protective measures."

We are dedicated to offering cutting-edge technologies to facilitate the transition of the energy sector over the coming decades. To accomplish this, we have created extensive multi-modal simulation tools and compared the findings with external research studies, such as IRENA, Fraunhofer, IHS, Agora Energiewende, and IEA.\n\nRegarding our internal operations, we have carried out a comprehensive analysis of our carbon neutral program as a test against higher energy or CO2-prices. Our team of experts employed high-price scenarios from IHS Autonomy, IEA Sustainable Development Scenario, and the Greenpeace Energy Revolution scenario to assess potential risks to our CO2-reduction strategy. By utilizing energy price predictions from these scenarios and a CO2 price forecast from the High-Level Commission on Carbon-Pricing, we were able to evaluate necessary adjustments and confirm the program's resilience.\n\nClimate-related scenario analysis is crucial for our business as it helps us anticipate potential consequences from regulatory changes, R&D, and customer trends and requirements. In fiscal 2020, we conducted forward-looking scenario analysis in accordance with the TCFD recommendation. In addition to IHS scenarios, we applied the IEA SDS scenarios, focusing on indicators such as renewable uptake, decentralization, energy efficiency demand, and CO2 prices for 2020-2040. The analysis did not alter our strategy but strongly validated it. The results demonstrated that our portfolio is robust against climate change, and the majority of our portfolio benefits from energy transformation, including Virtual Power Plants (VPP), Decentralized Energy Systems (DES), future grids, Digital Grids (DG), and storage."

As we examine how climate risk affects our business in the long term, we aim to implement and expand the use of scenario testing. We intend to voluntarily conduct scenario tests suggested by regulators, such as exploratory climate risk scenarios for financial institutions in 2021.\n\nMany organizations have established targets in line with global climate accords. We are evaluating comparable targets regarding the carbon emissions from our investments, considering their significance within our overall emissions profile and our goal of decarbonizing our investment portfolio.\n\nIn the meantime, we are increasing our ambition regarding our own emissions footprint. This year, we have established new and challenging targets for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, with the aim of achieving net carbon neutrality across these two scopes by the end of 2030. More details on the environmental impact of our direct operations can be found in the Environmental Impact section.\n\nDuring 2021, we will continue to expand our engagement strategy with key policy and political stakeholders around major climate conferences, focusing on financial sector issues to support the just transition and sustainable finance priorities, particularly in emerging markets. We understand that implementing our strategic ESG framework can generate opportunities for our company. Some of these opportunities will stem from our efforts to take early action against the climate risks we identify, including incorporating transition risk into investment decisions to minimize the risk of holding stranded assets. Others will come from supporting a fair transition. The infrastructure and capital expenditure required for the transition presents attractive investment opportunities in many cases. For instance, there is a role for institutions to both create new products and invest in structures and mechanisms that facilitate a phased withdrawal from reliance on coal-powered electricity within developing economies. In response to this, we have developed several responsible investment products that direct our customers' savings towards ESG-themed investments, such as the Asia Sustainable Bond Fund recently launched by Eastspring. More information on our ESG-related investment activities can be found in the Responsible Investment section.\n\nA review is underway to determine suitable targets regarding the carbon emissions from our investment portfolio.

        "output": "In compliance with TCFD recommendations, our company has evaluated the impact of various greenhouse gas (GHG) emission controls on our operations and the supply chain for potential transition and physical risks. We have considered the outcomes when determining the resiliency of strategies and have also referred to the latest physical science basis, published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to develop our own climate scenarios. In addition, we have also included potential growth in carbon emissions from expanding our business and new facilities as well as existing carbon reduction actions into our evaluations to analyze the potential financial impacts of climate risks. Previously, we evaluated climate risks solely using the worst-case scenario, but the future of climate change is highly unpredictable. As such, we have opted to evaluate climate risks across several scenarios this year to help map out and communicate operations strategies internally and provide comprehensive insights into climate trends over the mid-to-long term.\n\nClimate Scenario Selection\nIn terms of transition risks, there is now a global consensus that carbon pricing schemes are a necessary policy to achieve net zero emissions. We have referred to the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO), an IEA report commonly used by companies, and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to conduct climate scenario analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing then serves as the basis for us to evaluate the impacts of carbon pricing schemes on our locations in different countries.\n\nIn terms of physical risks, we have referred to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) published by IPCC in 2021 and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes in the future. We have also adopted the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) to derive GHG emissions under different social and economic landscapes. Our impact analysis on physical risks covers climate change evaluations across every region of the globe and provides detailed impact analysis to our locations and suppliers around the world through downscaling analysis."

        "output": "Our company has established and overseen a collection of risk management and control systems to identify and respond to potential threats to our business continuity. Central components of these systems consist of enterprise-wide procedures for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning enables us to recognize potential risks prior to significant business decisions, while management reporting facilitates closer monitoring of risks as our business advances. Our internal auditors regularly evaluate the sufficiency and efficiency of our risk management, and any shortcomings can be remedied through suitable measures.\n\nOur risk management strategy is all-encompassing, dynamic, and management-focused, and is embedded within our organization. It addresses both risks and opportunities. Our strategy is grounded in globally recognized frameworks, such as the COSO Framework and ISO 31000, and is customized to our company's specifications. The frameworks link our risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system.\n\nOur risk management process targets early recognition and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially impact our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is usually three years, and we employ a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities that remain after the implementation of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a systematic manner, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting typically follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues promptly.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on impact and probability, taking into account various viewpoints, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is complemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down approach ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at various management levels and are incorporated into the subsequent reporting process, if deemed relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are categorized within and for each of the departments mentioned. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. Our response strategies encompass avoidance, transfer, reduction, acceptance, and capitalizing on opportunities. For each risk or opportunity, responsibility entails the development, initiation, and monitoring of suitable response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures are specifically designed to facilitate effective risk management.\n\nOur company manages various risks, including those related to economic conditions and customer demand, project risks, and risks from the transmission of infectious agents. We closely monitor macroeconomic trends and developments in relevant industries to address the risk of economic instability and fluctuating customer demand. We maintain adequate insurance coverage for potential damage and liability risks to minimize our exposure and mitigate potential losses. We continuously gather information from relevant sources to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related countermeasures as early as possible."

We evaluate risks related to financial and market performance, operational efficiency, emergency preparedness and response, environmental compliance, and health and safety, among other areas. We prioritize risks based on their potential impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers, as well as regulatory requirements. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments evaluate domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. Additionally, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have reviewed potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. We have considered raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management discusses which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success. We also consult external stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. ISO 14001 defines an environmental aspect as an element of an organization's activities, products, or services that has or may have an impact on the environment. Our significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system. Each environmental aspect, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, is ranked from 0 through 4 based on criteria like severity, magnitude, probability, frequency, controllability, duration, employee concerns, community concerns, boundaries, business impact, and regulatory. The highest scores identify our significant impacts, which we focus on in more detail in our environmental management systems.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with global efforts to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our suppliers of raw materials. As a global organization, we rely on various suppliers for raw materials, some of which may be subject to supply constraints due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the production of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nWe assess upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nWe assess downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward certain business areas due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

For example, we have been providing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to reduce our emissions by half compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the US, Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

This will be a company-wide, cross-functional initiative involving participation from our asset owner and asset manager business units, risk, actuarial, and government relations teams.\n\nScenario analysis will be a key focus area as we aim to integrate it into our mainstream risk management processes during 2021 and report findings within management information at the company and business unit levels. We will continue to explore how climate risk impacts our business in the long term and aim to operationalize and increase the use of scenario testing. We plan to voluntarily run scenario tests emerging from regulators, such as exploratory climate risk scenarios for financial institutions in 2021.\n\nMany organizations have set targets in alignment with global climate goals. Our company is in the process of assessing similar targets in respect to the carbon emissions from our investments, given their importance within our overall emissions profile, and our commitment to decarbonizing our investment portfolio.\n\nIn the interim, we continue to increase our level of ambition in relation to our own emissions footprint. This year we have set new and stretching targets for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, with the aim of becoming net carbon neutral across these two scopes by the end of 2030. More information on the environmental impact of our direct operations is available in the Environmental section on page 46.\n\nDuring 2021, our company will continue to scale up our engagement strategy with key policy and political stakeholders around major climate conferences, with a focus on financial sector issues to support the just transition and sustainable finance priorities, particularly in emerging markets. We also recognize that the implementation of our strategic ESG framework can generate opportunities for our organization. Some of these opportunities will come through our efforts to take early mitigating action against the climate risks we identify, including incorporating transition risk into investment decisions to reduce the risk of being exposed to stranded assets. Others will come through supporting an inclusive transition. The infrastructure and capital expenditure required to enable the transition represents attractive investment opportunities in many cases. For example, there is a role for institutions to both develop new products and invest in structures and mechanisms that enable a managed withdrawal from reliance on coal-powered electricity within developing economies. In response to this, our company has developed several responsible investment products that channel our customers\u2019 savings towards ESG-themed investments, such as the Asia Sustainable Bond Fund recently launched by Eastspring. More information on our ESG-related investment activity is available in the Responsible Investment section on page 34.\n\nA review is underway to assess suitable targets in respect to the carbon emissions from our investment portfolio. We are also exploring further environmental/climate risk opportunities, such as the development of investment, insurance and digital products to support climate risk management."

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our Business Unit, for instance, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. Our Business Unit strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For example, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. In the current year, we managed to reduce our emissions by half compared to 2014. This program not only reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations but also upstream through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nTogether with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the U.S., Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal Siemens Water Tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

These systems include enterprise-wide processes for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning helps us identify potential risks before major business decisions, while management reporting enables us to monitor such risks more closely as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management, and if deficiencies are detected, appropriate measures can be adopted for their elimination.\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-oriented, and is integrated into our organization. It addresses both risks and opportunities. Our approach is based on globally accepted standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO Standard 31000, and is adapted to our company's specific needs. The frameworks connect our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process with our financial reporting process and internal control system. They consider our strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of our business operations, the reliability of our financial reporting, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important.\nOur ERM process aims for early identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially affect our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues in a timely manner.\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on impact and likelihood, considering different impact perspectives. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant.\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the business units. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. Our response strategies include avoidance, transfer, reduction, acceptance, and seizing opportunities. Response measures are specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\nWe mitigate risks through various response measures, such as hedging activities for fluctuations in currency and interest rates, systematic and comprehensive project management, and appropriate insurance levels for potential damage and liability risks. We address risks of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries, and by adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if necessary.\nWe constantly check information from relevant institutions, such as the World Health Organization, to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible. We have established a cross-functional team to coordinate our response to such risks and ensure that appropriate measures are taken in a timely and effective manner. Confidentiality and data protection are of utmost importance to us, and all information is handled in accordance with applicable laws and regulations."

        "output": "After conducting a thorough ESG review, our company has established a new Strategic Framework (the 'framework'). This framework aligns with our business strategy and our mission to help individuals maximize their potential, build wealth, and achieve their savings goals. The framework consists of three strategic pillars, each with a clear connection to our business strategy. In each pillar, we have identified focus areas where our company can make a significant impact.\n\nWe are confident that our new ESG strategic framework and our long-term goals to decrease carbon emissions and promote an inclusive transition are essential for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and discharge our fiduciary duties. This framework will enable us to manage risk over the long term while contributing to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Given that transition risk represents the most immediate and impactful financial risk, we have initiated an analysis of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio. This analysis focused on investments where our company holds significant influence over the investment process. Preliminary reports were generated using climate-related data and metrics provided through a vendor tool. This process allows us to identify the carbon contributions of various sectors and determine the most carbon-intensive companies in our investment portfolio. We have also calculated the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) for the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes in our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in markets with varying levels of development. Some markets boast diversified, service-led economies and mature financial markets, while others rely more on primary and energy-intensive industries. Emerging markets have a greater dependence on fossil fuels for their energy generation and less developed financial systems. The energy transition in these regions is expected to progress at a slower pace than in advanced economies. This was emphasized by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), during a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. Mr. Menon stated that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs, and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nFor our company, this implies that while we are committed to reducing carbon emissions in our investment portfolio, we recognize the importance of implementing this strategy in a manner that acknowledges the unique characteristics of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition equitably. Our commitment to an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We understand the significance of coalition building in driving an inclusive transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we collaborate with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale up domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group our company has co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to generate new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."

We evaluate risks related to financial and market performance, operational performance, emergency preparedness and response, environment, health and safety compliance, and regulatory impacts. We rank risks based on their potential impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are evaluated as part of financial disclosure requirements. Departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered. We have also evaluated raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is consulted to discuss relevant aspects for our future success. External stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019.

As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, reducing our risk of business interruptions and lowering transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents an opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences.

        "output": "Our Company's Direct Operations:\nRisk management is an essential process in our business, encompassing all functions. We evaluate risks related to financial and market performance, operational performance, emergency preparedness and response, environment, health and safety compliance, and regulatory impacts. We prioritize risks based on their impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments evaluate domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. Departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered. We have also evaluated raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is consulted to discuss relevant aspects for our future success. External stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, reducing our risk of business interruptions and lowering transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents an opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest our business focus. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the U.S., Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tools with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

This framework is fully aligned to our business strategy and our purpose of helping people get the most out of life by making healthcare accessible and affordable, helping them accumulate wealth through growing their assets, and empowering our customers to save for their goals.\n\nWe have identified three strategic pillars within our ESG framework, which have clear alignment with our business strategy. Within each of these, specific differentiating focus areas have been identified where we believe our company can make a meaningful impact. We will place greater focus on these differentiators.\n\nOur new strategic ESG framework and the long-term goals to decarbonise our investment portfolio and support an inclusive transition are an important way for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and fulfill our fiduciary obligations. It will reduce our exposure to asset risk \u2013 which includes transition risk \u2013 over time, while also contributing to efforts to decarbonise the global economy. Recognising that transition risk represents the nearest-term and most impactful financial risk to our company, we have conducted an initial transition risk analysis on investments where we maintain direct control and exert influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to the overall carbon footprint metrics of our investment portfolio and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded. It also enables us to determine and monitor the most carbon-intensive companies held in our investment portfolio. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes of our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in various markets, including highly developed economies with diversified, service-led economies and mature financial markets, and emerging markets that are more dependent on primary and energy-intensive industries. These emerging markets have a greater reliance on fossil fuels in their generation mix and less developed financial systems. The energy transition across the region is likely to proceed at a slower pace than for advanced economies.\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are committed to an objective to decarbonise our investment portfolio, we are mindful of the need to implement the strategy in a way that acknowledges the nature of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition in a fair manner. Our support for an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders.\n\nWe recognise the importance of coalition building in delivering an inclusive transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), we work with public and private sector institutions to scale domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s initiatives, including the ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group we have co-chaired since 2017, launch regular forums to catalyse new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."

        "output": "Our company's Approach to Managing Risks:\nRisk management in our organization encompasses all functions, including identifying risks related to financial and market performance, operational efficiency, emergency preparedness and response, environmental compliance, and regulatory impacts. We prioritize risks based on their potential impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being an integral part of this process.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments evaluate domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are evaluated as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is consulted to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In situations where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For instance, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where feasible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, our reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

        "output": "Our company's Direct Operations:\nRisk management is an integral process in our organization, involving all functions. We assess risks related to financial and market performance, operational performance, emergency preparedness and response, environment, health and safety compliance, among other areas. We prioritize risks based on their impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers, as well as regulatory requirements. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments evaluate business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have reviewed potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. We have considered raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management discusses which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success. We also consult external stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. ISO 14001 defines an environmental aspect as an element of an organization's activities, products, or services that has or may have an impact on the environment. Our significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system. Each environmental aspect, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, is ranked from 0 through 4 based on criteria like severity, magnitude, probability, frequency, controllability, duration, employee concerns, community concerns, boundaries, business impact, and regulatory. The highest scores identify our significant impacts, which we focus on in more detail in our environmental management systems.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our suppliers of raw materials. As a global company, we rely on various suppliers for raw materials, some of which may be subject to supply constraints due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nWe assess upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nWe assess downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

Decarbonization is set to bring about significant changes to the energy value chain in the coming decades. We are committed to offering innovative technologies to facilitate this transition. This requires a deep understanding of the technological advancements and costs needed over the next 30 + years. To accomplish this, we have created comprehensive multi-modal simulation tools. We have compared the outcomes of these tools with external research studies, such as IRENA, Fraunhofer, IHS, Agora Energiewende, and IEA.\nRegarding our internal operations, we have carried out scenario analysis as a test for the robustness of our carbon neutral program in the face of higher energy or CO2 prices. Our experts employed high-price scenarios using IHS Autonomy, IEA Sustainable Development Scenario, and the Greenpeace Energy Revolution scenario to identify potential risks to our CO2-reduction plan. By utilizing predictions on energy prices from these scenarios and a forecast for CO2 prices from the High-Level Commission on Carbon-Pricing, we assessed required adjustments. The analysis results indicated that our existing program is robust.\nClimate-related scenario analysis allows our business to anticipate potential consequences from regulatory changes, R&D, and customer trends and requirements. In fiscal 2020, we conducted forward-looking scenario analysis in accordance with the TCFD recommendation. In addition to IHS scenarios, we applied the IEA SDS scenarios, focusing on indicators such as renewable uptake, decentralization, energy efficiency demand, and CO2 prices for 2020-2040.

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a benchmark year. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nThe collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our water strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in a certain country has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the rainy season, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low, due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business sector has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. Our strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For example, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a benchmark year. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new project that drives the selection process for new sites and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nThe collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in a certain year as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in a later year and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in certain regions, whereas some sites in other regions are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our water strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in a certain country has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the rainy season, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low, due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

We prioritize risks based on their impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being part of this process.\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is consulted to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with global climate agreements to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In situations where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the production of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For instance, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where feasible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, our reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

        "output": "Our company's Direct Operations:\nRisk management is a crucial process in our business, encompassing all functions. We evaluate risks related to financial and market performance, operational efficiency, emergency preparedness and response, environmental compliance, and regulatory impacts. We rank risks based on their potential impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments evaluate domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are evaluated as part of financial disclosure requirements. Departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered. We have also evaluated raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is consulted to discuss relevant aspects for our future success. External stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, reducing our risk of business interruptions and lowering transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents an opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest our business focus. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

This encompasses expenditures on energy conservation or carbon reduction facilities, pricier renewable energy or RECs, carbon credits, and additional costs due to uncertainties in the development of new energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies.\n\nPhysical risks predominantly revolve around escalating electricity costs due to chronic climate changes, such as increasing temperatures. Costs associated with combating drought involve expenses for constructing water reclamation systems, utilizing reclaimed water, and acquiring backup water sources. For acute climate change disasters like floods and strong winds, we have integrated prevention systems into our facilities and will not be evaluating their financial impact.\n\nOur company has also estimated the cost of reputation damage from not achieving net zero emission targets, although there is no universally accepted method to quantify such financial impact. The financial impact of a 1% revenue reduction was a consensus reached by experts following discussions and assessments. The financial impact from climate opportunities includes reduced costs from enhanced energy and water use efficiency and diverse water sources, as well as additional revenue from offering low-carbon products and services such as 7nm or more advanced processes, Power Management ICs (PMICs), and ultralow power (ULP) ICs.\n\nAnalysis findings suggest that developing low-carbon products and services offers the most significant opportunity for positive financial impacts, as the demand for low-carbon products and advanced manufacturing processes continues to expand."

In addition, we have also included potential growth in carbon emissions from expanding our operations and new facilities as well as existing carbon reduction actions into general evaluations to analyze the potential financial impacts of climate risks. In the past, we evaluated climate risks solely using the worst-case scenario, but the future of climate change is highly unpredictable. As such, we have opted to evaluate climate risks across several scenarios this year to help map out and communicate operations strategies internally and give comprehensive insights into climate trends over the mid-to-long term.\n\nClimate Scenario Selection\nIn terms of transition risks, there is now a global consensus that carbon pricing schemes are a necessary policy to achieve net zero emissions. We have referred to widely used reports, such as the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO) published by the IEA, and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to conduct climate scenario analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing then serves as the basis for us to evaluate the impacts of carbon pricing schemes on our locations in different countries.\n\nIn terms of physical risks, we have referred to the latest reports published by reputable organizations such as the IPCC and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes in the future. We have also adopted the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) to derive GHG emissions under different social and economic landscapes.

        "output": "After conducting a thorough review of our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices, we have formulated a new ESG Strategic Framework (the 'framework'). This framework aligns with our business strategy and our mission to help individuals maximize their potential, build wealth, and achieve their savings goals. The framework consists of three strategic pillars, each with a clear connection to our business strategy. Within these pillars, we have identified specific focus areas where our company can make a significant impact.\n\nWe are confident that our new ESG framework and our long-term goals to decrease the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio and support a fair transition are essential steps for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and discharge our fiduciary duties. This approach will gradually minimize our exposure to asset risk, including transition risk, over time, while also contributing to global decarbonization efforts. In our initial assessment, we analyzed the transition risk of our investment assets, focusing on those where we have direct control and influence over the investment process. We utilized climate-related data and metrics from a proprietary vendor tool to generate preliminary reports. These reports provide a sector-by-sector breakdown of carbon footprint metrics for our investment portfolio and pinpoint the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most susceptible to being stranded. They also enable us to identify and monitor the most carbon-heavy companies in our investment portfolio. We have also calculated the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) for our listed equity and corporate bond asset classes.\n\nOur company operates in diverse markets, including advanced economies with service-led, diversified industries and mature financial markets, and emerging markets that are more reliant on primary and energy-intensive industries. These emerging markets have a greater dependence on fossil fuels for their energy generation and less developed financial systems. The energy transition in these regions is expected to progress at a slower pace compared to advanced economies. This was emphasized by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), during a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. Mr. Menon stated that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily reliant on fossil fuels for their energy needs, and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nFor our company, this implies that while we are dedicated to the objective of decarbonizing our investment portfolio, we recognize the importance of implementing the strategy in a manner that acknowledges the unique characteristics of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition equitably. Our commitment to a fair transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We understand the significance of coalition building in driving a fair transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we collaborate with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale up domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group we have co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to generate new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."

The financial analysis of climate-related risks primarily concentrates on market and technology-related costs to minimize carbon emissions, in line with our Net Zero Emissions by 2050 goal. This encompasses expenses on energy conservation or carbon reduction facilities, pricier renewable energy or RECs, carbon credits, and additional costs due to uncertainties in the development of new energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies.\n\nPhysical risks primarily focus on escalating electricity costs due to chronic climate changes, such as increasing temperatures. Costs related to combating drought include expenses for constructing water reclamation systems, utilizing reclaimed water, and purchasing backup water sources. For acute climate change disasters like floods and strong winds, we have already integrated prevention systems into our facilities and will not be calculating their financial impact.\n\nOur company has also estimated the cost of reputation damage from failing to meet net zero emission targets. However, there is no globally recognized methodology to quantify such financial impact. The financial impact of a 1% revenue reduction was a consensus reached by experts after discussions and assessments. The financial impact from climate opportunities includes reduced costs from increased energy and water use efficiency and diverse water sources, as well as additional income from providing low-carbon products and services such as 7nm or more advanced processes, Power Management ICs (PMICs), and ultralow power (ULP) ICs.\n\nAnalysis results suggest that developing low-carbon products and services presents the greatest opportunity for positive financial impacts, as demands for low-carbon products and advanced manufacturing processes continue to grow."

The Board recognizes the importance of these initiatives and has established a Group ESG Committee to provide senior executive involvement and holistic oversight. The Committee is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and includes the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, the HR Director, and senior representatives from our business units. One of the Group ESG Committee's responsibilities is to oversee our progress towards fulfilling our commitment to report against the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In 2020, the Group ESG Committee reported to the Board through a relevant committee.\n\nThe Board recognizes that the next 12 to 18 months are critical for the implementation of our ESG Strategic Framework and related matters, such as the development and embedding of our purpose and values, diversity and inclusion (D&I) priorities, and employee engagement activities. In early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight during this period.\n\nOur policies and procedures for managing ESG issues are outlined in our Governance Manual. The Manual is subject to an annual formal content review, taking into consideration internal and external factors. Any instances of non-compliance identified through annual attestations are assessed by policy owners and reported to the Audit Committee.\n\nWe believe that our new strategic ESG framework and long-term goals to decarbonize our investment portfolio and support an inclusive transition are essential for meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary obligations. This approach will reduce our exposure to asset risk, including transition risk, over time, while also contributing to global decarbonization efforts. Our Risk function conducted an initial transition risk analysis on insurance assets managed in segregated portfolios by our asset managers. This analysis focused on investments where we maintain control and exert influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to our overall carbon footprint metrics and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded. It also enables the identification and monitoring of the most carbon-intensive companies held in our asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of our listed equity and corporate bond asset classes.\n\nThe Board's oversight of climate change risk has been significantly strengthened. In 2020, ESG was overseen by the Board through a relevant committee. In early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established until May 2022 to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight of ESG matters (including climate change). A Board workshop was held to evaluate the climate change risks facing our organization, discuss transition and physical risk concepts, and review potential Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)."

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our Business Services (SI) division, for instance, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For example, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to reduce our emissions by half compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nTogether with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate on a yearly basis 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the US, Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our company's Siemens Water Tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nIn addition to our own operations, natural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

Process - We have integrated climate risk into our existing risk framework and incorporated it into the policies and controls for the relevant risks where appropriate. We recognize the need for enhanced capabilities and new sources of data.\n\nWe consider greenwashing to be an emerging risk that is likely to increase over time, as we develop capabilities and offerings to help our clients transition to a low-carbon economy. We also acknowledge that green finance taxonomies are not consistent globally, and evolving taxonomies and practices could result in revisions in our sustainable finance reporting going forward.\n\nWe use stress testing and scenario analysis to assess how these climate risks will impact our customers, business, and infrastructure. Integration into policies and procedures - In 2022, we incorporated climate considerations into our mortgage origination process for our retail mortgage business and new money request process for our key wholesale businesses. We also continued to enhance our climate risk scoring tool, which will enable us to assess our customers\u2019 exposures to climate risk. We published our updated energy policy, covering various sectors, and updated our thermal coal phase-out policy.\n\nWe are integrating climate risk into the policies, processes, and controls across many areas of our organization, and we will continue to update these as our climate risk management capabilities mature over time. Consider climate-related risks in traditional banking industry risk categories (supplementary guidance for banks) - In 2022, we expanded our scope to consider climate risk impacts on our other risk areas (including treasury risk and traded risk) in our risk framework.

Our objective is to minimize climate impacts through management by objectives and ensure business continuity. In response to the increasing carbon costs associated with global low-carbon transitions, we have initiated an internal carbon pricing scheme. This scheme takes into account factors such as regulations, fines, market pricing, and costs of carbon reduction. This carbon pricing scheme incorporates carbon costs into the impact valuations of our daily reduction measures and influences our investment decisions regarding new facilities. For instance, in 2022, we implemented 684 energy conservation measures across eight categories under our energy conservation program, saving approximately 700 GWh in energy that year. Evaluations using our internal carbon pricing scheme indicate that the potential external carbon costs from carbon emission reductions amount to around NT$530 million."

We recognize that implementing our strategic ESG framework can generate opportunities for our company. Some of these opportunities will come through our efforts to take early mitigating action against the climate risks we identify, including incorporating transition risk into investment decisions to reduce the risk of being exposed to stranded assets. Others will come through supporting an inclusive transition. The infrastructure and capital expenditure required to enable the transition presents attractive investment opportunities in many cases.

This approach will gradually minimize our exposure to asset risk, including transition risk, over time, while also contributing to global decarbonization efforts. In our initial assessment, we analyzed the transition risk of our investment assets, focusing on those where we have direct control and influence. We utilized climate-related data and metrics from a proprietary vendor tool to generate preliminary reports, which helped us identify the carbon footprint of various sectors in our investment portfolio and pinpoint the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those at risk of being stranded. This analysis also allowed us to determine and monitor the carbon intensity of the companies in our investment portfolio.

While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs, and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nGiven this context, our commitment to decarbonizing our investment portfolio must be implemented in a way that acknowledges the unique challenges of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition fairly. Our support for an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We recognize the importance of collaboration in driving an inclusive transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we collaborate with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale up domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group we have co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to generate new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."

Due to challenges in data sourcing and processes, there have been impacts on certain climate disclosures.\n\nClimate scenario analysis is used as a risk assessment tool to provide insights on the long-term effects of transition and physical risks across our corporate and retail portfolios, as well as our own operations. Our sustainable finance ambition enables sustainable infrastructure and energy systems, promotes decarbonisation efforts across the real economy, and enhances investor capital through sustainable investment.\n\nWe aim to achieve net zero in our financed emissions by 2050 and in our own operations and supply chain by 2030. We aim to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn of sustainable finance and investment for our customers in their transition to net zero and a sustainable future.\n\nOur assessment of climate risks covers three distinct time periods: short term (up to 2025), medium term (2026 to 2035), and long term (2036 to 2050). Transition or physical climate-related issues identified are assessed using enhanced questionnaires and scoring tools.\n\nWe support our customers in their transition through our sustainable finance and investment ambition. Our sustainable finance data dictionary includes a detailed definition of contributing activities.\n\nCertain perils, such as coastal, river, and surface water flooding, drive potential credit losses in our retail portfolio. Around 20% of our financed properties are in London, and most are protected by the Thames Barrier.\n\nWe identified six key sectors with the highest exposure to climate transition risk: automotive, chemicals, construction and building materials, metals and mining, oil and gas, and power and utilities. We continued to improve our identification and assessment of climate risk within our retail mortgage portfolio, with increased investments in physical risk data and enhancements to our internal risk assessment capabilities and models.\n\nOpportunities include sustainable finance, sustainable investment, and sustainable infrastructure. For a detailed breakdown of our sustainable finance progress by geography, see the ESG Data Pack.\n\nWe report our exposure to high transition risk sectors in our wholesale portfolio. Since 2020, we have rolled out the questionnaire to include our largest customers in the next highest climate transition risk sectors: agriculture, industrials, real estate, and transportation.\n\nAs a result of climate scenario analysis, our largest and most impacted sectors \u2013 power and utilities, construction and building materials, and chemicals \u2013 are subject to increased levels of transition risks. Our asset management division is increasingly considering both physical and transition risks and integrating ESG and climate analysis into the investment decision-making process.\n\nTransition to net zero represents one of our strategic pillars. We aim to be net zero in our operations and supply chain by 2030 and in our financed emissions by 2050. Scenario analysis supports our strategy by assessing our position under a range of climate scenarios and helping us plan for the future and meet growing regulatory requirements.\n\nWe continue to develop our climate scenario analysis exercises to have a more comprehensive understanding of climate headwinds, risks, and opportunities that will support our strategic planning and actions. We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of climate-related issues on financial planning, particularly the impact on financial performance and financial position. We expect to further enhance our disclosure and processes in relation to acquisitions/divestments in the medium term.\n\nClimate change poses a physical risk to the buildings we occupy as an organization, including offices, retail branches, and data centers. We use stress testing to evaluate the potential impact to our owned or leased premises. Our scenario stress test, conducted in 2022, analyzed how seven different climate change-related hazards could impact 500 of our critical and important buildings.\n\nOur Climate Solutions Partnership is a philanthropic initiative that aims to identify and remove barriers to scale for climate change solutions. We support start-up companies developing carbon-cutting technologies, nature-based solutions, renewable energy initiatives in Asia, and the WWF-led Asia Sustainable Palm Oil Links programme.\n\nDuring Board meetings, we balance discussions on the company's performance, emerging risks, and duties to shareholders while remaining conscious of responsibilities to support communities and help customers. In 2022, the Board approved an update to the thermal coal phase-out policy and the publication of an updated energy policy. We have committed to publishing our own climate transition plan in 2023.

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For example, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nThe collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the US, Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our water strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low, due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

        "output": "Our company's Direct Operations:\nRisk management is a crucial process for our business, encompassing all functions. We evaluate risks related to financial and market performance, operational efficiency, emergency preparedness and response, environmental compliance, and regulatory impacts. We rank risks based on their potential impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are evaluated as part of financial disclosure requirements. Departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered. We have also evaluated raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We employ a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is consulted to discuss relevant aspects for our future success. External stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with global climate agreements to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In cases where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the production of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For instance, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We employ a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our guidelines, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where feasible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we operate, reducing our risk of business interruptions and lowering transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents an opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We employ a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to inform our business strategy. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles) due to anticipated increased adoption."

For climate scenario analysis, we can run 30-year scenarios for both Physical and Transition Risk. Some elements of our Physical Risk scenario analysis can also extend to 2100.\n\nProcesses used to determine material risks and opportunities: Our company utilizes a range of tools and methodologies to assess Transition and Physical Climate Risk, which we apply to our clients, portfolios, and our own operations. These include scenario analysis, location-based hazard and risk scores, temperature alignment scores, and Munich Re's NATHAN tool (acute physical risk impact assessments). In addition, we engage with our corporate clients to understand their transition and physical risks, as well as their plans to prepare for climate change. In 2022, we continued to enhance our understanding of climate-related risks and significantly strengthened our stress testing and scenario analysis abilities for a range of management scenarios that are more plausible.\n\nClimate-related risk and opportunities identified: Our company has assessed the impact of Climate Risk on our business using scenario analysis over a 30-year time horizon, which has enabled us to identify and mitigate climate risks which may manifest. Sustainability and climate change have moved from being predominantly risk-based initiatives to becoming a value driver. This gives us an opportunity to deploy our market and industry knowledge to advise our clients on their individual sustainability journeys. Sustainable finance is an opportunity to both defend our existing business from Transition Risk and to fund our clients' transition from a high-carbon present to a low-carbon future. Through supporting clients on their net zero journeys and providing further finance to clients as they adapt to be less carbon intensive and emitting over time, we help mitigate their, and our, Transition Risk. Our aim to achieve Sustainable Finance income of $1 billion by 2025 and to mobilize $300 billion of Sustainable Finance by 2030 are measures of this success. We do not fully disclose impacts on financial planning and performance (including proportions of income, costs, and balance sheet related to climate-related opportunities), detailed Climate Risk exposures for all sectors and geographies, or physical risk metrics. Data limitations, and our plans to mitigate these, are discussed in greater detail in the report.\n\nSignificant concentrations of credit exposure to carbon-related assets: Our company has disclosed our exposures to high-carbon sectors, which includes the expected credit losses on these balances as well as the maturity profiles associated with them. Our exposure to high-carbon sectors makes up 14.4% of our loan balances. We aim to become net zero in our financed emissions by 2050, with interim 2030 targets for our highest emitting sectors. In 2022, we made progress towards this goal and set out to measure, manage, and reduce emissions starting with our most carbon-intensive sectors, in line with our net zero roadmap."

        "output": "Our company has established and overseen a collection of risk management and control mechanisms to facilitate the early identification of potential threats to our business continuity. Central components of these mechanisms include enterprise-wide procedures for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning enables us to recognize potential risks prior to significant business moves, while management reporting allows us to closely monitor risks as our business advances. Our internal auditors routinely evaluate the sufficiency and efficiency of our risk management, and any shortcomings can be remedied through suitable measures.\n\nOur risk management strategy is all-encompassing, collaborative, and focused on management, and is embedded within our organization. It encompasses both risks and opportunities. Our strategy is grounded in globally recognized standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO 31000, and is customized to our company's specifications. The frameworks link our risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system.\n\nOur risk management process strives for early recognition and assessment of risks and opportunities that could materially impact our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is generally three years, and we employ a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities that remain after the implementation of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a systematic manner, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting typically follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues in a timely fashion.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on impact and probability, taking into account various viewpoints, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down component ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at various management levels and are incorporated into the subsequent reporting process, if deemed relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are categorized within and for each of the departments mentioned. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. Our response strategies include avoidance, transfer, reduction, acceptance, and capitalizing on opportunities. For each risk or opportunity, responsibility entails the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures are specifically designed to enable effective risk management.\n\nOur company manages various risks, including those related to economic conditions and customer demand, project risks, and risks from the transmission of infectious agents. We closely monitor macroeconomic trends and developments in relevant industries to address the risk of economic instability and fluctuating customer demand. We maintain adequate insurance coverage for potential damage and liability risks to minimize our exposure and mitigate potential losses. We continually gather information from relevant sources to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible."

We tailor these frameworks to our unique business needs.\n\nThe ERM process is interconnected with our financial reporting process and our internal control system. These frameworks regard our strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of our business operations, the accuracy of our financial reporting, and adherence to applicable laws and regulations as equally crucial. ERM employs a net risk approach and encompasses risks and opportunities that persist following the implementation of existing risk mitigation measures.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are ranked based on their potential impact and probability. Responsibilities are allocated for all significant risks and opportunities, with the extent of responsibility contingent upon the magnitude of the respective risk or opportunity. The assessment timeframe usually spans three years, but we also monitor emerging risks and opportunities beyond three years up to a century using our long-term forward-looking ERM radar feature. Evaluation is guided by impact and velocity."

Our approach to climate change and climate-related risks is outlined below. To demonstrate how we are meeting TCFD requirements, we have mapped our disclosures to each of its pillars. This is illustrated in a table at the end of this section of the report. Initially categorized as emerging risks, the ESG risks related to our business, which include climate risk, have recently been upgraded to Principal Risk status. Recently, we have engaged a dedicated climate risk consultancy to further refine our understanding of the nature and materiality of the risks posed by climate change to our business.\n\nWe recognize that the implementation of our strategic ESG framework can generate opportunities for our company. Some of these opportunities will come through our efforts to take early mitigating action against the climate risks we identify, including incorporating transition risk into investment decisions to reduce the risk of being exposed to stranded assets. Others will come through supporting an inclusive transition. The infrastructure and capital expenditure required to enable the transition presents attractive investment opportunities in many cases. For example, there is a role for institutions to both develop new products and invest in structures and mechanisms that enable a managed withdrawal from reliance on fossil fuels within developing economies. In response to this, we have developed several responsible investment products that channel our customers' savings towards ESG-themed investments.\n\nRisk identification work completed: \u2014 The risk identification and scenario process has identified six major risk categories.\n\nOpportunities identified to support climate change mitigation and adaptation: \u2014 Our digital health platform supports the surveillance and diagnosis of diseases that are becoming more prevalent due to climate change. \u2014 Our investment offerings include ESG-themed funds that our company offers to its customers."

        "output": "After conducting our ESG review, our company has established a new ESG Strategic Framework (the 'framework'). This framework aligns with our business strategy and our mission to help individuals optimize their lives by making healthcare accessible and affordable, growing their assets, and enabling them to save for their goals.\n\nWe have identified three strategic pillars within our ESG framework, which align with our business strategy. Within each of these, specific focus areas have been identified where our company can make a significant impact. We will prioritize these areas moving forward.\n\nOur new strategic ESG framework and our commitment to decarbonizing our investment portfolio and supporting an inclusive transition are essential ways for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and uphold our fiduciary responsibilities. This approach will help reduce our exposure to asset risk, including transition risk, over time, while also contributing to global decarbonization efforts. Recognizing that transition risk represents the most immediate and impactful financial risk to our company, we have conducted an initial analysis of the transition risk associated with our investments where we have direct control and influence. Preliminary reports were generated using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This process allows us to assess the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio and identify the most carbon-intensive sectors and companies. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes in our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in various markets, including developed economies with diverse, service-led economies and mature financial markets, and emerging markets that are more reliant on primary and energy-intensive industries. These emerging markets have a greater dependence on fossil fuels in their energy generation mix and less developed financial systems. The energy transition in these regions is expected to progress more slowly than in advanced economies.\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are committed to decarbonizing our investment portfolio, we recognize the need to implement this strategy in a manner that acknowledges the unique characteristics of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition equitably. Our support for an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders.\n\nWe understand the importance of collaboration in driving an inclusive transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), we collaborate with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale up domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group our company has co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to generate new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."

Due to challenges in data sourcing and processes, there have been impacts on certain climate disclosures.\n\nClimate scenario analysis is used as a risk assessment tool to provide insights on the long-term effects of transition and physical risks across our corporate and retail portfolios, as well as our own operations. Our sustainable finance ambition enables sustainable infrastructure and energy systems, promotes decarbonisation efforts across the real economy, and enhances investor capital through sustainable investment.\n\nWe aim to achieve net zero in our financed emissions by 2050 and in our own operations and supply chain by 2030. We aim to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn of sustainable finance and investment for our customers in their transition to net zero and a sustainable future.\n\nOur assessment of climate risks covers three distinct time periods: short term (up to 2025), medium term (2026 to 2035), and long term (2036 to 2050). Transition or physical climate-related issues identified are assessed using enhanced questionnaires and scoring tools.\n\nWe support our customers in their transition through our sustainable finance and investment ambition. Our sustainable finance data dictionary includes a detailed definition of contributing activities.\n\nCertain perils, such as coastal, river, and surface water flooding, drive potential credit losses in our retail portfolio. Around 20% of our financed properties are in a major city, and most are protected by a flood barrier.\n\nWe identified six key sectors with the highest exposure to climate transition risk: automotive, chemicals, construction and building materials, metals and mining, oil and gas, and power and utilities. We continued to improve our identification and assessment of climate risk within our retail mortgage portfolio, with increased investments in physical risk data and enhancements to our internal risk assessment capabilities and models.\n\nOpportunities include sustainable finance, sustainable investment, and sustainable infrastructure. For a detailed breakdown of our sustainable finance progress by region, see the ESG Data Pack.\n\nWe report our exposure to high transition risk sectors in our wholesale portfolio. Since 2020, we have rolled out the questionnaire to include our largest customers in the next highest climate transition risk sectors: agriculture, industrials, real estate, and transportation.\n\nAs a result of climate scenario analysis, our largest and most impacted sectors \u2013 power and utilities, construction and building materials, and chemicals \u2013 are subject to increased levels of transition risks. Our asset management division is increasingly considering both physical and transition risks and integrating ESG and climate analysis into the investment decision-making process.\n\nTransition to net zero represents one of our strategic priorities. We aim to be net zero in our operations and supply chain by 2030 and in our financed emissions by 2050. Scenario analysis supports our strategy by assessing our position under a range of climate scenarios and helping us plan for the future and meet growing regulatory requirements.\n\nWe continue to develop our climate scenario analysis exercises to have a more comprehensive understanding of climate headwinds, risks, and opportunities that will support our strategic planning and actions. We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of climate-related issues on financial planning, particularly the impact on financial performance and financial position. We expect to further enhance our disclosure and processes in relation to acquisitions/divestments in the medium term.\n\nClimate change poses a physical risk to the buildings we occupy as an organization, including offices, retail branches, and data centers. We use stress testing to evaluate the potential impact to our owned or leased premises. Our scenario stress test, conducted in 2022, analyzed how seven different climate change-related hazards could impact 500 of our critical and important buildings.\n\nOur Climate Solutions Partnership is a philanthropic initiative that aims to identify and remove barriers to scale for climate change solutions. We support start-up companies developing carbon-cutting technologies, nature-based solutions, renewable energy initiatives, and the WWF-led Asia Sustainable Palm Oil Links programme.\n\nDuring Board meetings, we balance discussions on the company's performance, emerging risks, and duties to shareholders while remaining conscious of responsibilities to support communities and help customers. In 2022, the Board approved an update to the thermal coal phase-out policy and the publication of an updated energy policy. We have committed to publishing our own climate transition plan in 2023."

        "output": "Our company has implemented and coordinated a set of risk management and control systems to support the early recognition of developments that could jeopardize business continuity. These systems include enterprise-wide processes for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning helps identify potential risks before major business decisions, while management reporting enables closer monitoring of such risks as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management, and if deficiencies are detected, appropriate measures can be adopted for their elimination.\n\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-oriented, and is integrated into our organization. It addresses both risks and opportunities. Our approach is based on globally accepted standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO Standard 31000, and is adapted to our requirements. The frameworks connect our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process with our financial reporting process and internal control system. They consider strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of business operations, the reliability of financial reporting, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important.\n\nOur ERM process aims for early identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially affect our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues in a timely manner.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on impact and likelihood, considering different impact perspectives. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each organizational unit. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. Our response strategies include avoidance, transfer, reduction, acceptance, and seizing opportunities. Response measures are specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe mitigate risks through various response measures, such as hedging activities for fluctuations in currency and interest rates, systematic and comprehensive project management, and appropriate insurance levels for potential damage and liability risks. We address risks of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries, and by adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if necessary.\n\nWe constantly check information from relevant institutions, such as the World Health Organization, to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible."

        "output": "Our company's Direct Operations:\nRisk management in our organization encompasses all functions, including evaluating risks related to financial and market performance, operational performance, emergency preparedness and response, environment, health and safety compliance, and regulatory impacts. We prioritize risks based on their impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being part of this process.\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is consulted to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with global climate targets to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In situations where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the production of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our policies, supplier codes of conduct, purchase order terms and conditions, and responsible sourcing policies help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, our reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward certain business areas due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

Financial impact analysis of climaterelated risks primarily focuses on market and technology-related costs to reduce carbon emissions, aligning with our Net Zero Emissions by 2050 goal. This includes expenses on energy conservation or carbon reduction facilities, more expensive renewable energy or RECs, carbon credits, and additional costs due to uncertainties in the development of new energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies.\n\nPhysical risks mainly focus on growing electricity costs due to chronic climate changes, such as rising temperatures. Costs related to combating drought include expenses for building water reclamation systems, using reclaimed water, and purchasing backup water sources. For acute climate change disasters like floods and strong winds, we have already designed prevention systems into our facilities and will not be calculating their financial impact.\n\nOur company has also estimated the cost of reputation damage from failing to meet net zero emission targets. However, there is no globally recognized approach to estimate such financial impact, and these calculations are subject to uncertainty. The financial impact of a 1% revenue reduction was a consensus reached by experts after discussions and assessments.\n\nThe financial impact of climate opportunities includes reduced costs from increased energy and water use efficiency and diverse water sources, as well as additional income from providing low-carbon products and services. These may include advanced manufacturing processes, Power Management ICs (PMICs), and ultralow power (ULP) ICs.\n\nAnalysis results indicate that developing low-carbon products and services presents the greatest opportunity for positive financial impacts, as demands for such products continue to grow."

This approach will help us reduce our exposure to asset risk over time while contributing to global decarbonization efforts. Our Risk function conducted an initial transition risk analysis on insurance assets managed in segregated portfolios by our asset managers. This analysis focused on investments where we maintain direct control and exert influence over the investment process. Preliminary reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to our overall carbon footprint metrics and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded. It also enables us to determine and monitor the most carbon-intensive companies held in our asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes of our insurance investment portfolio.\n\nThe Board's oversight of climate change risk has been significantly strengthened. In 2020, ESG was overseen by the Board through the Nomination & Governance Committee. In early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established until May 2022 to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight of ESG matters (including climate change). A Board Risk Committee workshop was held to evaluate the climate change risks facing our organization, discuss transition and physical risk concepts, and review potential Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)."

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a benchmark year. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nTogether with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in a certain country has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

Introduction\n\nAs a TCFD specialist, I cannot stress enough the significance of the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) framework. This voluntary reporting framework, developed by the Financial Stability Board, is crucial for organizations to effectively understand, assess, and disclose climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nII. Importance of TCFD\n\nThe TCFD framework is essential for several reasons. First, it provides a consistent and transparent approach for organizations to disclose climate-related information, making it easier for investors, lenders, and other stakeholders to make informed decisions. Second, it helps organizations better understand their own climate risks and opportunities, enabling them to take appropriate action to mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities. Lastly, the TCFD framework aligns with regulatory trends and investor expectations, making it an increasingly important consideration for businesses.\n\nIII. TCFD Reporting Requirements\n\nThe TCFD framework consists of four main areas: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. Organizations are required to disclose information related to these areas in their annual reports or other public disclosures.\n\nA. Governance\n\nOrganizations must disclose their board oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities, as well as the role of management in assessing and managing these risks.\n\nB. Strategy\n\nOrganizations must describe the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on their business strategy, as well as their response to those impacts.\n\nC. Risk Management\n\nOrganizations must disclose their processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks, as well as their risk assessment results.\n\nD. Metrics and Targets\n\nOrganizations must provide metrics and targets related to climate-related risks and opportunities, allowing stakeholders to evaluate their progress in addressing these risks and opportunities.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, as a TCFD specialist, I strongly encourage organizations to adopt the TCFD framework. By doing so, they will not only meet the expectations of investors, lenders, and regulators but also gain a better understanding of their own climate risks and opportunities, enabling them to take appropriate action and capitalize on opportunities.\n\nV. References\n\nFor more information on the TCFD framework, please refer to the following resources:\n\n- TCFD Recommendations: <https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/TCFD-Recommendations-2021.pdf>\n- TCFD Implementation Guide: <https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/TCFD-Implementation-Guide-2021.pdf>",

        "output": "Our company does not perceive any significant risk from climate change that would materially affect us. Instead, we view the shift towards a low carbon economy as an opportunity. In our fiscal year 2019, we reduced 637 million metric tonnes of CO2 at customer sites through our environmental portfolio. Based on a favorable business case, we aimed to decrease the carbon footprint of our own operations by half by 2020 compared to 2014 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. We integrate climate change risks into our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process, addressing areas such as legal, market, regulatory, and physical risks. We classify these risks into one of the four dimensions \u2013 Strategic, Operations, Financial, and Compliance. An illustrative risk within the Compliance dimension is the F-gas regulation (EU) 517 / 2014, which encompasses the reduction of SF6. Our company is subject to this regulation, with 24 sites currently employing SF6. The reduction of SF6 is one component of our efforts to become carbon neutral by 2030. We achieved a reduction of nearly 6% compared to the previous year and 54% since 2014."

Previously, we assessed climate risks solely based on the worst-case scenario; however, the future of climate change is uncertain. Consequently, we have elected to evaluate climate risks under multiple scenarios this year to help design and communicate internal strategies and offer a comprehensive understanding of climate tendencies over the medium-to-long term.\n\nClimate Scenario Selection\nRegarding transition risks, there is a global agreement that carbon pricing mechanisms are essential for achieving net zero emissions. We consulted the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO), an IEA report widely utilized by companies worldwide, and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to perform climate risk analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing serves as the foundation for us to evaluate the implications of carbon pricing schemes on our facilities in various countries.\n\nIn terms of physical risks, we consulted the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) published by IPCC in 2021 and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes in the future. We also adopted the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) to derive GHG emissions under diverse social and economic contexts.

The Committee is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and includes the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, the HR Director, and senior representatives from our business units. One of the Group ESG Committee's responsibilities is to oversee our progress towards fulfilling our commitment to report against the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In 2020, the Group ESG Committee reported to the Board through the Nomination & Governance Committee.\n\nThe Board recognizes that the next 12 to 18 months are critical for the implementation of our ESG Strategic Framework. Therefore, in early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight during this period. The Working Group is chaired by a Non-executive Director and comprises four other Non-executive Directors.\n\nOur company's policies and procedures for managing Environmental, Social, and Governance issues are outlined in our Group Governance Manual. This manual is subject to an annual content review, taking into consideration both internal and external factors. Any instances of non-compliance with the manual identified by our businesses through their annual attestation are assessed by the policy owners and reported to the Group Audit Committee.\n\nWe believe that our new strategic ESG framework and long-term goals to reduce our carbon footprint and support an inclusive transition are essential for meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary obligations. This approach will help us reduce our exposure to asset risk over time while contributing to global decarbonization efforts. Our Risk function conducted an initial transition risk analysis on insurance assets managed in segregated portfolios by our asset managers. This analysis focused on investments where we maintain direct control and exert influence over the investment process. Preliminary reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to our overall carbon footprint metrics and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded. It also enables us to determine and monitor the most carbon-intensive companies held in our asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes of our insurance investment portfolio.\n\nThe Board's oversight of climate change risk has been significantly strengthened. In 2020, ESG was overseen by the Board through the Nomination & Governance Committee. In early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established until May 2022 to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight of ESG matters (including climate change). A Board Risk Committee workshop was held to evaluate the climate change risks facing our organization, discuss transition and physical risk concepts, and review potential Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)."

It enhances our understanding of climate change, enables us to plan for the future, and assists us in meeting growing regulatory requirements.\n\nIn 2022, our company conducted its initial internal climate scenario analysis exercise, employing four scenarios to represent the spectrum of potential climate change outcomes. The analysis focused on the primary regions where we operate and evaluated the impact on our balance sheet between the 2022 and 2050 timeframe. Key performance drivers and their consideration:\n\nClimate scenario analysis allows our company to model how different climate pathways might influence our customers and portfolios, particularly concerning credit losses. Under the Current Commitments scenario, we anticipate moderate credit losses due to transition risks. However, the escalating global warming will result in increasing physical risk losses in later years.\n\nAssumptions of scenarios and their relation to government policies: The assumptions for our climate stress testing exercise encompass varying levels of governmental climate policy changes, macroeconomic factors, and technological developments. However, these scenarios hinge on the development of technologies that are still uncertain, such as global hydrogen production to decarbonize aviation and shipping. For more information on the assumptions, please refer to the ESG Data Pack.\n\nPossible adjustments and adaptations of our strategies: The nature of the scenarios, our evolving capabilities, and the limitations of the analysis result in indicative outcomes of climate change headwinds, although they do not represent a direct forecast.\n\nAdvancements in climate science, data, methodology, and scenario analysis techniques will enable our company to refine its approach further. Consequently, our perspective on risk is expected to evolve over time.\n\nOur company intends to continue enhancing its capabilities for climate scenario analysis and employ the results for decision-making, primarily in relation to strategy, by utilizing the range of scenario analysis outcomes to shape our strategy across business units and regions.\n\nAt present, our company does not fully disclose the quantitative impacts of transition and physical risks, due to challenges including data limitations and evolving science and methodologies."

        "input": "Answer the following questions: \n1. Corporate risk management framework\n",
        "output": "Our company has established and coordinated a set of risk management and control systems to identify and address developments that may threaten our business continuity. These systems consist of enterprise-wide processes for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning helps us assess potential risks before significant business decisions, while management reporting enables us to closely monitor these risks as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly assess the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management, and any deficiencies are addressed through appropriate measures. This coordination of processes and procedures aims to keep the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board informed about significant risks in a timely manner.\n\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-oriented, integrated into the organization, and covers both risks and opportunities. It is based on globally accepted standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO Standard 31000, and is adapted to our specific needs. The frameworks connect the risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system. They consider our strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of our business operations, the reliability of our financial reporting, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important.\n\nOur risk management process aims for early identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially impact our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities that remain after the execution of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues in a timely manner.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on their impact and likelihood, considering different perspectives, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each organizational unit. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. The first step in assuming responsibility for a risk or opportunity involves choosing one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies for risks include avoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance. Our general response strategy for opportunities is to \"seize\" the opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures must be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates through hedging activities. Regarding our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and clearly defined approval processes, helps us identify and respond to project risks at an early stage. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure to such risks and minimize potential losses.\n\nWe address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries and adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if necessary.\n\nThere are worldwide risks from the transmission of infectious agents from animals to humans, from humans to humans, and in other ways. Epidemic, pandemic, or other spread patterns, such as bioterrorism, threaten to cause high disease rates in different countries, regions, or continents. We constantly monitor information from organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO), the American and European Centers for Disease Control, and the German Robert Koch Institute to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible."

This includes expenses on energy conservation or carbon reduction facilities, more expensive renewable energy or RECs, carbon credits, and additional costs due to uncertainties in the development of new energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies.\n\nPhysical risks mainly focus on growing electricity costs due to chronic climate changes, such as rising temperatures. Costs related to combating drought include expenses for building water reclamation systems, using reclaimed water, and purchasing backup water sources. For acute climate change disasters like floods and strong winds, we have already designed prevention systems into our facilities and will not be calculating their financial impact.\n\nOur company has also estimated the cost of reputation damage from failing to meet net zero emission targets. However, there is no globally recognized approach to estimate such financial impact. The financial impact of a 1% revenue reduction was a consensus reached by experts after discussions and assessments. The estimated financial impact from climate opportunities includes reduced costs from increased energy and water use efficiency and diverse water sources, as well as additional income from providing low-carbon products and services such as advanced semiconductor processes, Power Management ICs (PMICs), and ultralow power (ULP) ICs.\n\nAnalysis results indicate that developing low-carbon products and services presents the greatest opportunity for positive financial impacts, as demands for such products and services continue to grow."

        "input": "Answer the following questions: \n1. Handling climate-related risk and opportunities\n",
        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our Business Services (SI) division, for instance, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For example, we have been providing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to reduce our emissions by half compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nThe collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the US, Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our water strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal Siemens Water Tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low, due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

The Board recognizes the importance of senior executive involvement and holistic oversight of ESG matters material to our organization. In 2020, a Group ESG Committee was established, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, with members including the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, HR Director, and senior representatives from our business units. The Committee is responsible for overseeing our progress towards fulfilling our commitment to report against the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nThe Board understands that the next 12 to 18 months are critical for the implementation of our ESG Strategic Framework. Therefore, in early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established, chaired by a Non-executive Director, and comprising four other Non-executive Directors, to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight during this period.\n\nOur company's policies and procedures for managing ESG issues are outlined in our Group Governance Manual. This manual undergoes an annual content review, taking into consideration both internal and external factors. Any instances of non-compliance with the manual identified by our businesses through their annual attestation are assessed by the policy owners and reported to the Group Audit Committee.\n\nWe believe that our new strategic ESG framework and long-term goals to reduce our carbon footprint and support an inclusive transition are essential for meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary obligations. This approach will help us reduce our exposure to asset risk over time while contributing to global decarbonization efforts. Our Risk function conducted an initial transition risk analysis on insurance assets managed in segregated portfolios by our asset managers. This analysis focused on investments where we maintain direct control and exert influence over the investment process. Preliminary reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to our overall carbon footprint metrics and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded. It also enables us to determine and monitor the most carbon-intensive companies held in our asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes of our insurance investment portfolio.\n\nThe Board's oversight of climate change risk has been significantly strengthened. In 2020, ESG was overseen by the Board through the Nomination & Governance Committee. In early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established until May 2022 to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight of ESG matters (including climate change). A Board Risk Committee workshop was held to evaluate the climate change risks facing our organization, discuss transition and physical risk concepts, and review potential Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)."

We prioritize risks based on their impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. Departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered. We have also evaluated raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is interviewed to discuss relevant aspects for our future success. External stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, reducing our risk of business interruptions and lowering transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents an opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest our business focus. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

        "output": "Our company's Approach to Managing Risks:\nRisk management is a crucial process in our organization, encompassing all functions. We identify and assess risks related to financial and market performance, operational efficiency, emergency preparedness and response, environmental compliance, and health and safety, among other areas. We prioritize risks based on their potential impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers, as well as regulatory requirements. Our Enterprise Risk Management program addresses key enterprise risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments evaluate business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. Additionally, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. We have considered raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management discusses which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success. We also consult external stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. ISO 14001 defines an environmental aspect as an element of an organization's activities, products, or services that has or may have an impact on the environment. Our significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system. Each environmental aspect, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, is ranked from 0 through 4 based on criteria like severity, magnitude, probability, frequency, controllability, duration, employee concerns, community concerns, boundaries, business impact, and regulatory. The highest scores identify our significant impacts, which we focus on in more detail in our environmental management systems.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our suppliers of raw materials. As a global organization, we rely on various suppliers for raw materials, some of which may be subject to supply constraints due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

The Board recognizes the importance of the next 12 to 18 months for the implementation of our ESG Strategic Framework and related matters, such as our purpose and values, diversity and inclusion priorities, and employee engagement activities.\n\nTo provide senior executive involvement and holistic oversight of ESG matters, we established a Group ESG Committee in 2020. The Committee is chaired by our CFO and COO and includes our Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, HR Director, and senior representatives from our business units. One responsibility of the Group ESG Committee is to oversee our progress towards reporting against the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nThe Board understands the significance of this period for implementing our ESG Strategic Framework and related matters. In early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight during this critical period.\n\nOur policies and procedures for managing ESG issues are outlined in our Group Governance Manual (GGM). The GGM is subject to annual review and sets standards for managing potential ESG issues across the company. Any instances of non-compliance with the GGM identified through annual attestations are assessed by policy owners and reported to the Group Audit Committee.\n\nWe believe that our new strategic ESG framework and long-term goals to decarbonize our investment portfolio and support an inclusive transition are essential for meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary obligations. This approach will reduce our exposure to asset risk, including transition risk, over time, while also contributing to global decarbonization efforts.\n\nOur Risk function conducted an initial transition risk analysis on insurance assets managed in segregated portfolios by our asset managers. This analysis focused on investments where we maintain direct control and exert influence over the investment process. Preliminary reports were generated using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This analysis facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to our overall carbon footprint metrics and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors and companies.\n\nThe Board's oversight of climate change risk has been significantly strengthened. In 2020, ESG was overseen by the Board through the Nomination & Governance Committee. In early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight of ESG matters (including climate change) until May 2022. A Board Risk Committee workshop was held to evaluate the climate change risks facing the company, discuss transition and physical risk concepts, and review potential Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)."

We evaluate risks related to financial and market performance, operational efficiency, emergency preparedness and response, environmental compliance, and regulatory impacts. We rank risks based on their potential impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are evaluated as part of financial disclosure requirements. Departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered. We have also evaluated raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is consulted to discuss relevant aspects for our future success. External stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with global climate targets to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our policies and procedures, including a Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy, help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, reducing our risk of business interruptions and lowering transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents an opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest our business focus. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward energy-efficient technologies due to the anticipated increased adoption of these technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

Due to challenges in data sourcing and processes, there have been impacts on certain climate disclosures.\n\nClimate scenario analysis is used as a risk assessment tool to provide insights on the long-term effects of transition and physical risks across our corporate and retail banking portfolios, as well as our own operations. Our sustainable finance initiative enables sustainable infrastructure and energy systems, promotes decarbonisation efforts across the real economy, and enhances investor capital through sustainable investment.\n\nWe aim to achieve net zero in our financed emissions by 2050 and in our own operations and supply chain by 2030. We aim to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn of sustainable finance and investment for our customers in their transition to net zero and a sustainable future.\n\nOur assessment of climate risks covers three distinct time periods: short term (up to 2025), medium term (2026 to 2035), and long term (2036 to 2050). Transition or physical climate-related issues identified are assessed using enhanced questionnaires and scoring tools.\n\nWe support our customers in their transition through our sustainable finance and investment initiative. Our sustainable finance data dictionary includes a detailed definition of contributing activities.\n\nCertain perils, such as coastal, river, and surface water flooding, drive potential credit losses in our retail portfolio. Around 20% of our financed properties are in a major city, and most are protected by a flood barrier.\n\nWe identified six key sectors with the highest exposure to climate transition risk: automotive, chemicals, construction and building materials, metals and mining, oil and gas, and power and utilities. We continued to improve our identification and assessment of climate risk within our retail mortgage portfolio, with increased investments in physical risk data and enhancements to our internal risk assessment capabilities and models.\n\nOpportunities include sustainable finance, sustainable investment, and sustainable infrastructure. For a detailed breakdown of our sustainable finance progress by region, see the ESG Data Pack.\n\nWe report our exposure to high transition risk sectors in our wholesale portfolio. Since 2020, we have rolled out the questionnaire to include our largest customers in the next highest climate transition risk sectors: agriculture, industrials, real estate, and transportation.\n\nAs a result of climate scenario analysis, our largest and most impacted sectors \u2013 power and utilities, construction and building materials, and chemicals \u2013 are subject to increased levels of transition risks. Our asset management division is increasingly considering both physical and transition risks and integrating ESG and climate analysis into the investment decision-making process.\n\nTransition to net zero represents one of our strategic priorities. We aim to be net zero in our operations and supply chain by 2030 and in our financed emissions by 2050. Scenario analysis supports our strategy by assessing our position under a range of climate scenarios and helping us plan for the future and meet growing regulatory requirements.\n\nWe continue to develop our climate scenario analysis exercises to have a more comprehensive understanding of climate headwinds, risks, and opportunities that will support our strategic planning and actions. We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of climate-related issues on financial planning, particularly the impact on financial performance and financial position. We expect to further enhance our disclosure and processes in relation to acquisitions/divestments in the medium term.\n\nClimate change poses a physical risk to the buildings we occupy as an organization, including offices, retail branches, and data centers. We use stress testing to evaluate the potential impact to our owned or leased premises.

Our analysis primarily focused on credit costs through 2050.\n\nWe utilized a Monte Carlo simulation to ascertain the rates at which typhoons and other storms result in wind and water-related building loss or damage. Subsequently, we analyzed the potential direct (collateral value) and indirect (business stagnation) impacts on our company's credit costs from the loss or damage of mortgaged real estate (buildings) in Japan. This analysis targeted middle-market firms and SMEs in Japan. The impact on mortgage lending value was minimal, while the impact of business stagnation was \u00a552 billion at most under both 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C scenarios."

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For example, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nThe collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the US, Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our water strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal water tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low, due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

        "output": "Over the next three years, our company will work to enhance the management of climate risk across our organization. This will be a company-wide cross-functional initiative, involving participation from our asset owner and asset manager business units, risk, actuarial, and government relations teams.\n\nScenario analysis will be a key focus area as we plan to integrate it into our mainstream risk management processes during 2021 and begin reporting findings within management information at the company and business unit levels. As we continue to examine how climate risk impacts our business in the long term, we aim to operationalize and increase the use of scenario testing. We plan to voluntarily run scenario tests emerging from regulators, such as exploratory climate risk scenarios for financial institutions in 2021.\n\nMany organizations have set targets in alignment with global climate goals. Our company is in the process of assessing similar targets in respect of the carbon emissions from our investments, given their significance within our overall emissions profile, and our commitment to decarbonizing our investment portfolio.\n\nIn the interim, we continue to raise the bar in relation to our own emissions footprint. This year we have set new and challenging targets for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, with the aim of becoming net carbon neutral across these two scopes by the end of 2030. More information on the environmental impact of our direct operations is available in the Environmental section on page 46.\n\nDuring 2021, we will continue to scale up our engagement strategy with key policy and political stakeholders around major climate conferences, with a focus on financial sector issues to support the just transition and sustainable finance priorities, particularly in emerging markets. We also recognize that the implementation of our strategic ESG framework can generate opportunities for our company. Some of these opportunities will come through our efforts to take early mitigating action against the climate risks we identify, including incorporating transition risk into investment decisions to reduce the risk of being exposed to stranded assets. Others will come through supporting an inclusive transition. The infrastructure and capital expenditure required to enable the transition represents attractive investment opportunities in many cases. For example, there is a role for institutions to both develop new products and invest in structures and mechanisms that enable a managed withdrawal from reliance on coal-powered electricity within developing economies. In response to this, we have developed several responsible investment products that channel our customers\u2019 savings towards ESG-themed investments, such as the Asia Sustainable Bond Fund recently launched by Eastspring. More information on our ESG-related investment activity is available in the Responsible Investment section on page 34.\n\nA review is underway to assess suitable targets in respect of the carbon emissions from our investment portfolio. We are also exploring further environmental/climate risk opportunities, such as the development of investment, insurance and digital products to support climate risk management."

        "output": "Text with placeholders:\nOur company's approach to climate scenario analysis:\nClimate scenario analysis is a crucial tool for our company, supporting our strategy by assessing our position under various climate scenarios. It enhances our awareness of climate change, helps us plan for the future, and meets our growing regulatory requirements. In 2022, we conducted our first internal climate scenario analysis exercise, employing four scenarios to represent the potential outcomes for global climate change. This analysis focused on the key regions where our company operates and evaluated the impact on our balance sheet between the 2022 and 2050 time period.\nKey drivers of performance and their consideration:\nClimate scenario analysis enables our company to model how different potential climate pathways may impact our customers and portfolios, particularly in terms of credit losses. Under the Current Commitments scenario, we anticipate moderate levels of losses related to transition risks. However, the rise in global warming will lead to increasing levels of physical risk losses in later years.\nScenarios employed and their relation to government policies:\nThe scenario assumptions for our climate stress testing exercise include varying levels of governmental climate policy changes, macroeconomic factors, and technological developments. However, these scenarios depend on the development of technologies that are still uncertain, such as global hydrogen production to decarbonize aviation and shipping. For more information on the assumptions, please refer to our ESG Data Pack.\nPossible adjustments to our strategies:\nThe nature of the scenarios, our evolving capabilities, and the limitations of the analysis result in indicative outcomes of climate change headwinds, although they are not a definitive forecast. Developments in climate science, data, methodology, and scenario analysis techniques will help us refine our approach further. Therefore, we anticipate this view of risk to evolve over time. Our company intends to continue strengthening our capabilities for climate scenario analysis and using the results for decision-making, particularly in respect to strategy, by utilizing the range of scenario analysis outcomes to shape our strategy across business and regions. Our company does not currently fully disclose the impacts of transition and physical risk quantitatively due to transitional challenges, including data limitations and evolving science and methodologies."

These systems consist of enterprise-wide processes for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning enables us to identify potential risks prior to significant business decisions, while management reporting allows us to closely monitor risks as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management, and any deficiencies can be addressed through appropriate measures.\n\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-focused, and is integrated into our organization. It addresses both risks and opportunities. Our approach is based on globally recognized standards, such as the COSO Framework and ISO 31000, and is customized to meet our company's specific needs. The frameworks connect our risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system.\n\nOur risk management process aims for early identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially impact our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities that remain after the implementation of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a structured manner, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues in a timely manner.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on impact and likelihood, considering various perspectives, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if deemed relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the business units. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. Our response strategies include avoidance, transfer, reduction, acceptance, and seizing opportunities. For each risk or opportunity, responsibility involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures are specifically tailored to enable effective risk management.\n\nOur company manages various risks, including those related to economic activity and customer demand, project risks, and risks from the transmission of infectious agents. We closely monitor macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries to address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand. We maintain appropriate insurance coverage for potential damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure and avoid or minimize potential losses. We constantly monitor information from relevant institutions to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible."

One of the Committee's responsibilities is to oversee our progress towards fulfilling our commitment to report against the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In 2020, the Committee reported to the Board through a relevant governance committee.\n\nThe Board acknowledges that the next 12 to 18 months are critical for the implementation of our ESG Strategic Framework. Therefore, in early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight during this period. The Working Group is chaired by a Non-executive Director and comprises other Non-executive Directors.\n\nOur company's policies and procedures for managing ESG issues are outlined in our Governance Manual. This manual is subject to an annual content review, taking into consideration both internal and external factors. Any instances of non-compliance with the manual identified through our annual attestation process are assessed by the policy owners and reported to the relevant governance committee.\n\nWe believe that our new strategic ESG framework and long-term goals to reduce our environmental impact and promote social inclusivity are essential for meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary obligations. This approach will help us manage risks and contribute to global sustainability efforts. Our Risk function conducted an initial analysis of transition risks on certain investments. This analysis focused on investments where we have control and influence over the investment process. Preliminary reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to our overall carbon footprint metrics and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors. It also enables us to determine and monitor the most carbon-intensive companies in our investment portfolio. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes in our investment portfolio.\n\nThe Board's oversight of climate change risk has been significantly strengthened. In 2020, ESG matters were overseen by the Board through a relevant governance committee. In early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established until May 2022 to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight of ESG matters (including climate change).

        "output": "Our company's Approach to Managing Risks:\nRisk management is a crucial process in our organization, encompassing all functions. We identify and assess risks related to financial and market performance, operational efficiency, emergency preparedness and response, environmental compliance, and health and safety, among other areas. We prioritize risks based on their potential impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers, as well as regulatory requirements. Our Enterprise Risk Management program addresses key enterprise risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments evaluate business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. Additionally, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. We have considered raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management discusses which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success. We also consult external stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. ISO 14001 defines an environmental aspect as an element of an organization's activities, products, or services that has or may have an impact on the environment. Our significant environmental impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system. Each environmental aspect, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, is ranked from 0 through 4 based on criteria like severity, magnitude, probability, frequency, controllability, duration, employee concerns, community concerns, boundaries, business impact, and regulatory. The highest scores identify our significant impacts, which we focus on in more detail in our environmental management systems.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our suppliers of raw materials. As a global organization, we rely on various suppliers for raw materials, some of which may be subject to supply constraints due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For example, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate on a yearly basis 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the US, Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our company's internal tools with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nIn addition to our own operations, natural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

This encompasses expenses related to energy conservation or carbon reduction facilities, pricier renewable energy or RECs, carbon credits, and additional costs due to uncertainties surrounding the development of new energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies.\n\nPhysical risks primarily concern themselves with escalating electricity costs due to climate changes, such as increasing temperatures. Costs associated with mitigating drought involve expenses for constructing water reclamation systems, utilizing reclaimed water, and procuring backup water sources. For extreme climate change events like floods and strong winds, we have already integrated prevention systems into our facilities and will not be calculating their financial impact.\n\nOur company has also assessed the potential cost of reputational damage resulting from failing to meet net zero emission targets. However, there is no universally accepted methodology for estimating such financial impact. The financial impact of a 1% revenue reduction was a consensus reached by experts following discussions and evaluations. The financial impact from climate opportunities includes cost savings from enhanced energy and water use efficiency and diverse water sources, as well as additional revenue from offering low-carbon products and services such as 7nm or more advanced processes, Power Management ICs (PMICs), and ultralow power (ULP) ICs.\n\nThe findings from our analysis suggest that the development of low-carbon products and services presents the most significant opportunity for positive financial impacts, as the demand for low-carbon products and advanced manufacturing processes continues to expand."

Strategic planning helps us identify potential risks before major business decisions, while management reporting enables us to monitor such risks more closely as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management, and if deficiencies are detected, appropriate measures can be adopted for their elimination.\n\nWe have a comprehensive, interactive, and management-oriented risk management approach that is integrated into our organization. It addresses both risks and opportunities. Our approach is based on globally accepted standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO Standard 31000, and is adapted to our company's specific needs.

Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues in a timely manner.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on impact and likelihood, considering different impact perspectives. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational units. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. Our response strategies include avoidance, transfer, reduction, acceptance, and seizing opportunities. Response measures are specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe mitigate risks through various response measures, such as hedging activities for fluctuations in currency and interest rates, systematic and comprehensive project management, and appropriate insurance levels for potential damage and liability risks. We address risks of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries, and by adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if necessary.\n\nWe constantly check information from relevant institutions, such as the World Health Organization, to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible. We have established protocols for responding to such risks, including communication plans, contingency plans, and the allocation of resources. Our employees are trained on these protocols and are encouraged to report any relevant information they may come across."

The infrastructure and capital expenditure required to facilitate the transition presents attractive investment opportunities in many cases. For instance, there is a role for institutions to both develop new products and invest in structures and mechanisms that enable a managed withdrawal from reliance on coal-powered electricity within developing economies. In response to this, our company has developed several responsible investment products that direct our customers\u2019 savings towards ESG-themed investments, such as the Asia Sustainable Bond Fund recently launched by Eastspring. More information on our ESG-related investment activity can be found in the Responsible Investment section.\n\nA review is underway to establish suitable targets regarding the carbon emissions from our investment portfolio. We are also exploring additional environmental/climate risk opportunities, such as the development of investment, insurance, and digital products to support climate risk management."

        "output": "Our company's Direct Operations:\nRisk management is an integral process in our business, involving all functions. We assess risks related to financial and market performance, operational performance, emergency preparedness and response, environment, health and safety compliance, and regulatory impacts. We prioritize risks based on their impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. Departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered. We have also evaluated raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is interviewed to discuss relevant aspects for our future success. External stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, reducing our risk of business interruptions and lowering transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents an opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest our business focus. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the U.S., Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

The evaluation of climate risks and opportunities is incorporated into our top-down and bottom-up processes, providing a comprehensive overview of our business activities. In fiscal 2020, the criteria for this climate change related top-down approach were specified in more detail based on the TCFD recommendations and are available to all business units as part of their quarterly risk management discussions.\n\nClimate change is not a standalone category within ERM, but is rather considered within the risk identification of the four areas: strategic, operational, financial, and compliance-related risks. In order to evaluate the potential climate change related net-risk for our ERM reporting, pre-ERM processes are in place. These include, for example, our environmental management system with its corresponding risk assessment of environmental impacts from our production or products.\n\nThe disclosure of risks is respectively bundled within the above-mentioned four areas and outlined in our Annual Report. Regarding climate change, we see respective measures that need to be taken as business opportunities.\n\nBy enabling our customers to lower their Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions across our portfolio and by reducing CO2 emissions in our own operations, our company aims to support the trend towards a low-carbon economy. Recent legislative and governmental initiatives to mitigate climate change worldwide, especially in Europe through initiatives such as the Green Deal or Sustainable Finance, present opportunities for our company."

        "output": "Our Company's Direct Operations:\nRisk management is an essential process in our organization, encompassing all functions. We evaluate risks related to financial and market performance, operational efficiency, emergency preparedness and response, environmental compliance, and health and safety. We prioritize risks based on their potential impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers, as well as regulatory requirements. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments evaluate domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. Additionally, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have reviewed potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high-intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. We have considered raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management discusses which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success. We also consult external stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. ISO 14001 defines an environmental aspect as an element of an organization's activities, products, or services that has or may have an impact on the environment. Our significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system. Each environmental aspect, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, is ranked from 0 through 4 based on criteria like severity, magnitude, probability, frequency, controllability, duration, employee concerns, community concerns, boundaries, business impact, and regulatory. The highest scores identify our significant impacts, which we focus on in more detail in our environmental management systems.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our suppliers of raw materials. As a global organization, we rely on various suppliers for raw materials, some of which may be subject to supply constraints due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the production of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

In addition, we have also included potential growth in carbon emissions from expanding our business and new facilities as well as existing carbon reduction actions into general evaluations to analyze the potential financial impacts of climate risks. In the past, we evaluated climate risks solely using the worst-case scenario, but the future of climate change is highly unpredictable. As such, we have opted to evaluate climate risks across several scenarios this year to help map out and communicate operations strategies internally and give comprehensive insights into climate trends over the mid-to-long term.\n\nClimate Scenario Selection\nIn terms of transition risks, there is now a global consensus that carbon pricing schemes are a necessary policy to achieve net zero emissions. We have referred to the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO), an IEA report commonly used by companies, and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to conduct climate scenario analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing then serves as the basis for us to evaluate the impacts of carbon pricing schemes on our locations in different countries.\n\nIn terms of physical risks, we have referred to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) published by IPCC in 2021 and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes in the future. We also adopted the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) to derive GHG emissions under different social and economic landscapes. Our impact analysis on physical risks covers climate change evaluations across every region of the globe and provides detailed impact analysis to our business and suppliers around the world through downscaling analysis."

Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business sector has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. Our strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For example, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a previous year. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nThe collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our water strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in a certain country has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low, due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

        "input": "Answer the following questions: \n1. Corporate risk management framework\n",
        "output": "Our company has implemented and coordinated a set of risk management and control systems to support the early recognition of developments that could jeopardize business continuity. These systems include enterprise-wide processes for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning helps us consider potential risks before major business decisions, while management reporting enables us to monitor such risks more closely as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management. If deficiencies are detected, appropriate measures can be adopted for their elimination. This coordination of processes and procedures is intended to help ensure that the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board are fully informed about significant risks in a timely manner.\n\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-oriented, integrated into the organization, and addresses both risks and opportunities. It is based on globally accepted standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO Standard 31000, and is adapted to our requirements. The frameworks connect the risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system. They consider our strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of our business operations, the reliability of our financial reporting, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important.\n\nOur risk management process aims for early identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievement of our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues in a timely manner.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized in terms of impact and likelihood, considering different impact perspectives, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed regarding potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational units mentioned above. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the hierarchical level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. In a first step, assuming responsibility for a specific risk or opportunity involves choosing one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies with respect to risks are avoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance of the relevant risk. Our general response strategy with respect to opportunities is to \"seize\" the relevant opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures have to be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates by engaging in hedging activities. Regarding our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and complemented by clearly defined approval processes, assists us in identifying and responding to project risks at an early stage, even before the bidding phase. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential cases of damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure to such risks and to avoid or minimize potential losses.\n\nWe address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries and adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary.\n\nOur company constantly checks information from reputable sources, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the American and European Centers for Disease Control, and the German Robert Koch Institute, to be able to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible."

This scheme takes into account factors such as regulations, fines, market pricing, and costs of carbon reduction. The carbon pricing scheme incorporates carbon costs into the impact valuations of our daily reduction measures and influences our investment decisions regarding new facilities. For instance, in 2022, we implemented 684 energy conservation measures across eight categories under our energy conservation program, saving approximately 700 GWh in energy that year. Evaluations using our internal carbon pricing scheme indicate that the potential external carbon costs from carbon emission reductions amount to around NT$530 million."

Our transition risk assessment concentrates on the sectors of electric utilities and oil, gas & coal in Japan. The analysis timeframe spans until 2050, although the International Energy Agency (IEA) scenario only extends to 2040. The estimated cost increases under dynamic and static scenarios are approximately \u00a5120 billion and \u00a5310 billion, respectively. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios we considered are 8.5 (4\u00b0C) and 2.6 (2\u00b0C).\n\nIn assessing potential impacts on our clients' businesses, we applied two scenarios: a static scenario, which assumes no change in the existing business structure, and a dynamic scenario, under which the business structure adapts to the transformation. Our analysis primarily focused on credit costs through 2050.\n\nWe utilized a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the frequencies at which typhoons and other storms cause wind and water-related building loss or damage. We then analyzed the potential direct (collateral value) and indirect (business stagnation) impacts on our company's credit costs from the loss or damage of mortgaged real estate (buildings) in Japan. This analysis targeted middle-market firms and SMEs in Japan. The impact on mortgage lending value was minimal, while the impact of business stagnation was \u00a552 billion at most under both 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C scenarios."

        "output": "Our company's Direct Operations:\nRisk management is an essential process in our organization, encompassing all functions. We evaluate risks related to financial and market performance, operational performance, emergency preparedness and response, environment, health and safety compliance, and other areas. We prioritize risks based on their impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers, as well as regulatory requirements. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments evaluate domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have reviewed potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. We have considered raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management discusses which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success. We also consult external stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. ISO 14001 defines an environmental aspect as an element of an organization's activities, products, or services that has or may have an impact on the environment. Our significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system. Each environmental aspect, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, is ranked from 0 through 4 based on criteria like severity, magnitude, probability, frequency, controllability, duration, employee concerns, community concerns, boundaries, business impact, and regulatory. The highest scores identify our significant impacts, which we focus on in more detail in our environmental management systems.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our suppliers of raw materials. As a global company, we rely on various suppliers for raw materials, some of which may be subject to supply constraints due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

The Board recognizes the importance of senior executive involvement and holistic oversight of ESG matters material to our organization. In 2020, a Group ESG Committee was established to provide this involvement and oversight. The Committee is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and includes the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, the HR Director, and senior representatives from our business units. One of the Group ESG Committee's responsibilities is to oversee our progress towards fulfilling our commitment to report against the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In 2020, the Group ESG Committee reported to the Board through the Nomination & Governance Committee.\n\nThe Board understands that the next 12 to 18 months are critical for the implementation of our ESG Strategic Framework. Therefore, in early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight during this period. The Working Group is chaired by a Non-executive Director and comprises four other Non-executive Directors.\n\nOur policies and procedures for managing Environmental, Social, and Governance issues are outlined in our Group Governance Manual. This manual is subject to an annual content review, taking into consideration both internal and external factors. Any instances of non-compliance with the manual identified by our businesses through their annual attestation are assessed by the policy owners and reported to the Group Audit Committee.\n\nWe believe that our new strategic ESG framework and long-term goals to reduce our carbon footprint and support an inclusive transition are essential for meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary obligations. This approach will help us reduce our exposure to asset risk over time while contributing to global decarbonization efforts. Our Risk function conducted an initial transition risk analysis on insurance assets managed in segregated portfolios by our asset managers. This analysis focused on investments where we maintain direct control and exert influence over the investment process. Preliminary reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to our overall carbon footprint metrics and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded. It also enables us to determine and monitor the most carbon-intensive companies held in our asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes of our insurance investment portfolio.\n\nThe Board's oversight of climate change risk has been significantly strengthened. In 2020, ESG was overseen by the Board through the Nomination & Governance Committee. In early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established until May 2022 to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight of ESG matters (including climate change). A Board Risk Committee workshop was held to evaluate the climate change risks facing our organization, discuss transition and physical risk concepts, and review potential Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)."

        "output": "Our company has established and overseen a collection of risk management and control mechanisms to facilitate the early recognition of potential threats to our business continuity. Central components of these mechanisms include enterprise-wide procedures for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning enables us to identify potential risks prior to significant business moves, while management reporting allows us to closely monitor risks as our business advances. Our internal auditors regularly evaluate the sufficiency and efficiency of our risk management, and any shortcomings can be remedied through suitable measures.\n\nOur risk management strategy is all-encompassing, dynamic, and management-focused, and is embedded within our organization. It deals with both risks and opportunities. Our strategy is grounded in globally recognized standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO 31000, and is customized to our company's specifications. The frameworks link our risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system.\n\nOur risk management process targets the early identification and assessment of risks and opportunities that could materially impact our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is generally three years, and we employ a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities that remain after the implementation of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a systematic manner, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting typically follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to expeditiously address critical issues.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on impact and probability, taking into account various viewpoints, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down aspect ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at various management levels and are incorporated into the subsequent reporting process, if deemed relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are consolidated within and for each of the departments mentioned. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. Our response strategies encompass avoidance, transfer, reduction, acceptance, and capitalizing on opportunities. For each risk or opportunity, responsibility entails the development, initiation, and monitoring of suitable response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures are specifically designed to enable effective risk management.\n\nOur company manages various risks, including those related to economic conditions and customer demand, project risks, and risks from the transmission of infectious agents. We closely monitor macroeconomic trends and developments in relevant industries to address the risk of economic instability and shifting customer demand. We maintain adequate insurance coverage for potential damage and liability risks to minimize our exposure and mitigate potential losses.

        "output": "Our company does not see any significant transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our Business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in a water-stressed country has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the rainy season, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

        "output": "Our company has implemented and coordinated a set of risk management and control systems to support the early recognition of developments that could jeopardize business continuity. These systems include enterprise-wide processes for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning helps us consider potential risks before major business decisions, while management reporting enables us to monitor such risks more closely as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management. If deficiencies are detected, appropriate measures can be adopted for their elimination. This coordination of processes and procedures is intended to help ensure that the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board are fully informed about significant risks in a timely manner.\n\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-oriented, integrated into the organization, and addresses both risks and opportunities. It is based on globally accepted standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO Standard 31000, and is adapted to our requirements. The frameworks connect the risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system. They consider our strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of our business operations, the reliability of our financial reporting, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important.\n\nOur risk management process aims for early identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievement of our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues in a timely manner.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized in terms of impact and likelihood, considering different impact perspectives, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed regarding potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational units mentioned above. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the hierarchical level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. In a first step, assuming responsibility for a specific risk or opportunity involves choosing one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies with respect to risks are avoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance of the relevant risk. Our general response strategy with respect to opportunities is to \"seize\" the relevant opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures have to be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates by engaging in hedging activities. Regarding our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and complemented by clearly defined approval processes, assists us in identifying and responding to project risks at an early stage, even before the bidding phase. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential cases of damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure to such risks and to avoid or minimize potential losses.\n\nWe address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries and adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary.\n\nOur company constantly checks information from reputable sources, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the American and European Centers for Disease Control, and the German Robert Koch Institute, to be able to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible."

For climate scenario analysis, we can run 30-year scenarios for both Physical and Transition Risk. Some elements of our Physical Risk scenario analysis can also extend to the end of the century.\n\nProcesses used to determine material risks and opportunities: We utilize a range of tools and methodologies to assess Transition and Physical Climate Risk for our clients, portfolios, and our own operations. These include scenario analysis, location-based hazard and risk scores, temperature alignment scores, and Munich Re's NATHAN tool (acute physical risk impact assessments). In addition, we engage with our corporate clients to understand their transition and physical risks, as well as their plans to prepare for climate change. In 2022, we continued to enhance our understanding of climate-related risks and significantly strengthened our stress testing and scenario analysis abilities for a range of management scenarios that are more plausible.\n\nClimate-related risk and opportunities identified: We have assessed the impact of Climate Risk on our business using scenario analysis over a 30-year time horizon, which has enabled us to identify and mitigate climate risks which may manifest. Sustainability and climate change have moved from being predominantly risk-based initiatives to becoming a value driver. This gives us an opportunity to deploy our market and industry knowledge to advise our clients on their individual sustainability journeys. Sustainable finance is an opportunity to both defend our existing business from Transition Risk and to fund our clients' transition from a high-carbon present to a low-carbon future. Through supporting clients on their net zero journeys and providing further finance to clients as they adapt to be less carbon intensive and emitting over time, we help mitigate their, and our, Transition Risk. Our aim to achieve Sustainable Finance income of $1 billion by 2025 and to mobilize $300 billion of Sustainable Finance by 2030 are measures of this success.

To accomplish this, we have created comprehensive multi-modal simulation tools and compared the results with external research studies, such as IRENA, Fraunhofer, IHS, Agora Energiewende, and IEA.\nIn terms of our own operations, we have conducted scenario analysis as a stress test on our carbon neutral program to ensure its resilience to higher energy or CO2-prices. Our experts applied high-price scenarios using various sources, including IHS Autonomy, IEA Sustainable Development Scenario, and the Greenpeace Energy Revolution scenario, to identify potential risks to our CO2-reduction plan. By utilizing predictions on energy prices from these scenarios and a forecast for CO2 prices from reputable sources, we were able to evaluate necessary adjustments and confirm the program's resilience.\nFor our business, climate-related scenario analysis enables us to anticipate potential consequences from regulatory changes, R&D, and customer trends and requirements. In fiscal 2020, we performed forward-looking scenario analysis in accordance with the TCFD recommendation. Besides IHS scenarios, we applied the IEA SDS scenarios, focusing on indicators such as renewable uptake, decentralization, energy efficiency demand, and CO2 prices for 2020-2040. The analysis did not influence our strategy but strongly confirmed it. The results showed that our portfolio is resilient to climate change, and the majority of our portfolio benefits from energy transformation, including Virtual Power Plants (VPP), Decentralized Energy Systems (DES), future grids, Digital Grids (DG), and storage."

We prioritize risks based on their impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being part of this process.\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are evaluated as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is consulted to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are engaged to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, our reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles) due to the anticipated increased adoption of these technologies."

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our Business Services (SI) division, for instance, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For example, we have been providing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have helped our customers save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. In the current year, we managed to reduce our emissions by half compared to 2014. This program not only reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations but also upstream through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nTogether with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate on a yearly basis 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the US, Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our company's Siemens Water Tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nBesides our own operations, natural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

The Committee is chaired by our CFO and COO and includes our Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, HR Director, and senior representatives from our business units. One responsibility of the Group ESG Committee is to oversee our progress towards reporting against the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nOur policies and procedures for managing ESG issues are outlined in our Company Governance Manual (GGM). The GGM is subject to annual review and sets standards for managing potential ESG issues across the organization. Any instances of non-compliance with the GGM identified through annual attestations are assessed by policy owners and reported to the Company Audit Committee.\n\nWe believe that our new strategic ESG framework and long-term goals to reduce our carbon footprint and support an inclusive transition are essential for meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary obligations. This approach will help us manage risk, including transition risk, over time, while also contributing to global decarbonization efforts.\n\nOur Risk function has conducted an initial analysis of transition risk related to private data in our investment portfolio. This analysis focuses on investments where we maintain direct control and exert influence over the investment process. Preliminary reports have been generated using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This analysis facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to our overall carbon footprint metrics and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors and companies.\n\nThe Board's oversight of climate change risk has been significantly strengthened. ESG matters, including climate change, are being overseen by a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group until May 2022. A Board Risk Committee workshop was held to evaluate the climate change risks facing the company, discuss transition and physical risk concepts, and review potential Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)."

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a benchmark year. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new project that drives the selection process for new sites and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in a certain country has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the rainy season, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

        "output": "At our company, we have established a robust risk management framework to identify and address potential threats to our business continuity. This includes enterprise-wide processes for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning enables us to assess risks before major business decisions, while management reporting helps us monitor risks closely as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly review the effectiveness of our risk management systems, and any deficiencies are addressed promptly.\n\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-focused, integrated into our organization, and addresses both risks and opportunities. It is based on globally recognized standards, such as the COSO Framework and ISO 31000, and is customized to our specific needs. Our risk management process is connected to our financial reporting process and internal control system. We consider our strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations, the reliability of our financial reporting, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations as equally important.\n\nOur risk management process aims to identify and evaluate risks and opportunities that could materially impact our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities that remain after the implementation of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified using a structured approach, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting follows a regular quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues in a timely manner.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on their impact and likelihood, considering various perspectives, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process if they are deemed relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each organizational unit. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. The first step in managing a risk or opportunity involves choosing one of our general response strategies: avoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance. Our general response strategy for opportunities is to \"seize\" the opportunity. In the second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures are tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe have implemented various response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates by engaging in hedging activities. For our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and clearly defined approval processes, helps us identify and respond to project risks at an early stage. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure to such risks and minimize potential losses.\n\nWe address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries and adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if necessary.\n\nOur company constantly monitors information from reputable sources, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the American and European Centers for Disease Control, and the German Robert Koch Institute, to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible."

        "output": "Following our ESG review, we have developed a new ESG Strategic Framework (the 'framework'). This framework is fully aligned to our business strategy and our purpose of helping people to get the most out of life, accumulate wealth, and save for their goals. The key features of our ESG framework include its three strategic pillars, which have clear alignment with our business strategy. Within each of these, specific differentiating focus areas have been identified where we believe our company can make a meaningful impact.\n\nWe believe that the new strategic ESG framework and the long-term goals to reduce carbon emissions and support an inclusive transition are an important way for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and fulfill our fiduciary obligations. It will help us manage risk over time, while also contributing to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Recognizing that transition risk represents the nearest-term and most impactful financial risk, we have conducted an initial analysis of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio. This analysis focused on investments where our company maintains control and exerts influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to the overall carbon footprint metrics of the asset book and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors. It also enables us to determine and monitor the most carbon-intensive companies held in the asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes of our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in markets with varying levels of development. Some markets have diversified, service-led economies and mature financial markets, while others are more dependent on primary and energy-intensive industries. These emerging markets have a greater reliance on fossil fuels in their generation mix and less developed financial systems. The energy transition across the region is likely to proceed at a slower pace than for advanced economies. This point was highlighted by a senior executive from a central banking institution in the region. Speaking at a financial conference, he noted that 'Emerging economies are at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are committed to an objective to reduce carbon emissions in our investment portfolio, we are mindful of the need to implement the strategy in a way that acknowledges the nature of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition in a fair manner. Our support for an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We recognize the importance of coalition building in delivering an inclusive transition. As a member of a sustainable investment partnership, we work with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The partnership\u2019s regional hub, whose Steering Group we have co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to catalyze new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."

We recognize that implementing our strategic ESG framework can generate opportunities for our company. Some of these opportunities will come through our efforts to take early mitigating action against the climate risks we identify, including incorporating transition risk into investment decisions to reduce the risk of being exposed to stranded assets. Others will come through supporting an inclusive transition. The infrastructure and capital expenditure required to enable the transition presents attractive investment opportunities in many cases.

Introduction\n\nAs a TCFD specialist, I cannot stress enough the importance of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework in today's business landscape. This framework, developed by the Financial Stability Board, is a voluntary and consistent reporting standard designed to help organizations understand, assess, and disclose climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nII. Climate-related Risks and Opportunities\n\nThe TCFD framework is essential for understanding and addressing climate-related risks and opportunities. Climate risks can materialize in various forms, such as physical risks (e.g., extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and natural disasters) and transition risks (e.g., regulatory changes, technological advancements, and shifts in market preferences).\n\nIII. TCFD Recommendations\n\nThe TCFD recommendations cover four key areas: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. By implementing these recommendations, organizations can improve their understanding of climate-related risks and opportunities and enhance their ability to manage these factors effectively.\n\nIV. Benefits of TCFD Compliance\n\nCompliance with the TCFD framework offers numerous benefits, including improved risk management, enhanced investor confidence, and increased transparency. Furthermore, many investors and regulators are increasingly demanding TCFD-compliant disclosures, making it a crucial aspect of corporate sustainability and long-term success.\n\nV. Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, as a TCFD specialist, I strongly advocate for the adoption and implementation of the TCFD framework by organizations. By addressing climate-related risks and opportunities, organizations can not only mitigate potential financial losses but also seize new opportunities and contribute to a more sustainable future.",

Based on a favorable business case, we intended to decrease the carbon footprint of our own operations by half by 2020 compared to 2014 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. We assess climate change risks in our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process, addressing areas such as legal, market, regulatory, or physical risks. We classify these risks into one of the four dimensions \u2013 Strategic, Operations, Financial, and Compliance. An illustrative risk within the Compliance dimension is the F-gas regulation (EU) 517 / 2014, which encompasses the reduction of SF6. Our company is subject to this regulation, with 24 sites currently employing SF6. The reduction of SF6 is one component of our efforts to become carbon neutral by 2030.

We are dedicated to offering innovative technologies to facilitate the transformation of the energy value chain over the next few decades. To accomplish this, we have created comprehensive multi-modal simulation tools and compared the results with external research studies, such as IRENA, Fraunhofer, IHS, Agora Energiewende, and IEA.\n\nIn terms of our own operations, we conducted scenario analysis as a stress test on our carbon neutral program to ensure its resilience to higher energy or CO2-prices. Our experts applied high-price scenarios using various sources, including IHS Autonomy, IEA Sustainable Development Scenario, and the Greenpeace Energy Revolution scenario, to identify potential risks to our CO2-reduction plan. By utilizing predictions on energy prices from these scenarios and a forecast for CO2 prices from the High-Level Commission on Carbon-Pricing, we evaluated necessary adjustments. The results of the analysis showed that our existing program is sufficiently resilient.\n\nClimate-related scenario analysis enables our business to anticipate potential consequences from regulatory changes, R&D, and customer trends and requirements. In fiscal 2020, we performed forward-looking scenario analysis in accordance with the TCFD recommendation. Besides IHS scenarios, we applied the IEA SDS scenarios, examining indicators such as renewable uptake, decentralization, energy efficiency demand, and CO2 prices for 2020-2040. The project did not influence our strategy but strongly confirmed it. The analysis revealed that our portfolio is resilient to climate change. In fact, the majority of our portfolio benefits from energy transformation, including Virtual Power Plants (VPP), Decentralized Energy Systems (DES), future grids, Digital Grids (DG), and storage, and will even be stronger in the next decades."

This framework aligns with our business strategy and our mission to enhance people's lives by making healthcare more accessible and affordable, helping them grow their wealth, and empowering them to save for their goals.\n\nOur ESG framework consists of three strategic pillars, each with a clear connection to our business strategy. Within these pillars, we have identified specific focus areas where our company can make a significant impact. We will prioritize these differentiators moving forward.\n\nOur new ESG framework and our commitment to reducing the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio are essential steps for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and fulfill our fiduciary responsibilities. By focusing on decarbonization, we aim to minimize asset risk, which includes transition risk, over time, while contributing to the global decarbonization effort. Recognizing that transition risk poses the most immediate and impactful financial risk to our company, we have conducted a preliminary analysis of investments under our direct control and influence. We used climate-related data and metrics from a third-party vendor tool to assess the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio and identify the sectors and companies most at risk. We have also calculated the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) for the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes in our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in various markets, including mature economies with diverse, service-led industries and advanced financial markets, as well as emerging markets that are more reliant on primary and energy-intensive industries. The energy transition in these emerging markets is expected to progress more slowly than in advanced economies due to their greater reliance on fossil fuels and less developed financial systems.\n\nIn light of this, our company is committed to an objective of decarbonizing our investment portfolio but recognizes the need to implement this strategy in a manner that acknowledges the unique challenges of the markets in which we operate. We believe in sharing the financial and social burden of the transition fairly among all our stakeholders.\n\nWe understand the importance of collaboration in driving an inclusive transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), we collaborate with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to increase investments in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP's ASEAN Hub, which our company has co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum aimed at generating new ideas for scaling up investments to further the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."

Strategic planning helps us identify potential risks prior to major business decisions, while management reporting enables us to monitor risks more closely as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly assess the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management, and any deficiencies can be addressed through appropriate measures.\n\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-oriented, and is integrated into our organization. It addresses both risks and opportunities. Our approach is based on globally accepted standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO 31000, and is adapted to our company's specific context. The frameworks connect our risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system.\n\nOur risk management process aims for early identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially affect our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. We take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues in a timely manner.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on impact and likelihood, considering different perspectives, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the business units. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. Our response strategies include avoidance, transfer, reduction, acceptance, and seizing opportunities. For each risk or opportunity, responsibility involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures are specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nOur company addresses various risks, including those related to economic activity and customer demand, project risks, and risks from the transmission of infectious agents. We closely monitor macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries to address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand. We maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure and avoid or minimize potential losses.

Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For example, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nThe collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the US, Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our water strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our company's Water Tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low, due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

Furthermore, we have incorporated potential increases in carbon emissions from expanding our operations and new facilities, as well as existing carbon reduction measures, into our evaluations to assess the potential financial implications of climate risks. Previously, we assessed climate risks based on the worst-case scenario alone. However, given the uncertainty surrounding future climate change, we have chosen to evaluate climate risks across multiple scenarios this year to help inform our internal decision-making and provide a comprehensive understanding of climate trends over the mid-to-long term.\n\nClimate Scenario Selection\nRegarding transition risks, there is a growing consensus that carbon pricing schemes will be essential for achieving net zero emissions. We have consulted the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO), a widely used IEA report, and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to conduct our climate scenario analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing serves as the foundation for us to assess the impacts of carbon pricing schemes on our operations in various countries.\n\nIn terms of physical risks, we have relied on the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) published by the IPCC in 2021 and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes. We have also adopted the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) to determine GHG emissions under various social and economic conditions.

        "output": "After conducting our ESG assessment, our company has established a new ESG Strategic Framework (the 'framework'). This framework aligns with our business strategy and our mission to enhance people's lives by making healthcare more accessible and affordable, helping them build wealth, and enabling them to save for their goals.\n\nWe have identified three key areas within our ESG framework, which align closely with our business strategy. Within each of these, we have pinpointed specific focus areas where our company can make a significant impact. We will prioritize these differentiators moving forward.\n\nOur new strategic ESG framework and our commitment to reducing the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio and supporting a fair transition are essential for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and uphold our fiduciary responsibilities. This approach will help us minimize risk \u2013 including transition risk \u2013 over time, while also contributing to global decarbonization efforts. Recognizing that transition risk poses the most immediate and impactful financial risk to our company, we have conducted an initial analysis of the carbon footprint of our investments where we hold significant influence. Preliminary reports were generated using climate-related data and metrics supplied by a proprietary vendor tool. This process allows us to assess the carbon impact of various sectors in our investment portfolio and identify the most carbon-intensive sectors, which may be at risk of being phased out. It also enables us to monitor and manage the carbon intensity of the companies in our investment portfolio. We have also calculated the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes in our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in various markets, including mature economies with diverse, service-oriented economies and well-established financial markets, and emerging markets that are more reliant on primary industries and energy-intensive sectors. These emerging markets have a greater dependence on fossil fuels for energy generation and less developed financial systems. The energy transition in these regions is expected to progress more slowly than in advanced economies.\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are dedicated to reducing the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio, we are cognizant of the need to implement this strategy in a manner that acknowledges the unique characteristics of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition equitably. Our commitment to a fair transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders.\n\nWe understand the importance of collaboration in driving a fair transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), we collaborate with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to expand domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group our company has co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to generate new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."

One of the Group ESG Committee's responsibilities is to oversee our progress towards fulfilling our commitment to report against the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nOur policies and procedures for managing ESG issues are outlined in our Company Governance Manual (GGM). The GGM is subject to an annual formal content review, taking into consideration internal and external factors. Any instances of GGM non-compliance identified through annual attestations are assessed by policy owners and reported to the Audit Committee.\n\nOur company believes that our new strategic ESG framework and long-term goals to decarbonize our investment portfolio and support an inclusive transition are essential for meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary obligations. This approach will reduce our exposure to asset risk, including transition risk, over time, while also contributing to global decarbonization efforts. Our Risk function conducted an initial transition risk analysis on insurance assets managed in segregated portfolios by our asset managers. This analysis focused on investments where we maintain direct control and exert influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to our overall carbon footprint metrics and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded. It also enables the identification and monitoring of the most carbon-intensive companies held in our asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of our listed equity and corporate bond asset classes.\n\nOur Board's oversight of climate change risk has been significantly strengthened. ESG matters, including climate change, are overseen by the Board through a dedicated Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group until May 2022. A Board Risk Committee workshop was held to evaluate the climate change risks facing our organization, discuss transition and physical risk concepts, and review potential Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)."

        "input": "Answer the following questions: \n1. Corporate risk management framework\n",
        "output": "Our company has implemented and coordinated a set of risk management and control systems to support the early recognition of developments that could jeopardize our business continuity. These systems include enterprise-wide processes for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning helps us consider potential risks before major business decisions, while management reporting enables us to monitor such risks more closely as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management. If deficiencies are detected, appropriate measures can be adopted for their elimination. This coordination of processes and procedures is intended to help ensure that the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board are fully informed about significant risks in a timely manner.\n\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-oriented, integrated into the organization, and addresses both risks and opportunities. It is based on globally accepted standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO Standard 31000, and is adapted to our requirements. The frameworks connect the risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system. They consider our strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of our business operations, the reliability of our financial reporting, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important.\n\nOur risk management process aims for early identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievement of our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues in a timely manner.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized in terms of impact and likelihood, considering different impact perspectives, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed regarding potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational units mentioned above. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the hierarchical level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. In a first step, assuming responsibility for a specific risk or opportunity involves choosing one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies with respect to risks are avoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance of the relevant risk. Our general response strategy with respect to opportunities is to \"seize\" the relevant opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures have to be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates by engaging in hedging activities. Regarding our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and complemented by clearly defined approval processes, assists us in identifying and responding to project risks at an early stage, even before the bidding phase. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential cases of damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure to such risks and to avoid or minimize potential losses.\n\nWe address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries and adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary.\n\nOur company constantly checks information from reliable sources to identify and respond to potential risks related to the transmission of infectious agents from animals to humans, from humans to humans, and in other ways. Epidemic, pandemic, or other spread patterns such as bioterrorism threaten to cause high disease rates in different countries, regions, or continents. We are committed to ensuring the health and safety of our employees, customers, and stakeholders, and we take all necessary measures to mitigate the risks associated with infectious diseases and bioterrorism."

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our Business Services (SI) division, for instance, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For example, we have been providing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to reduce our emissions by half compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate on a yearly basis 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the US, Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our company's internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nIn addition to our own operations, natural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

In fiscal 2020, the criteria for this climate change related top-down approach were specified in more detail based on the TCFD recommendations and are available to all business units as part of their quarterly risk management discussions.\n\nClimate change is not a standalone category within ERM, but is rather considered within the risk identification of the four areas: strategic, operational, financial, and compliance-related risks. In order to evaluate the potential climate change related net-risk for our ERM reporting, pre-ERM processes are in place. These include, for example, our environmental management system with its corresponding risk assessment of environmental impacts from our production or products.\n\nThe disclosure of risks is respectively bundled within the above-mentioned four areas and outlined in our Annual Report. Regarding climate change, we see respective measures that need to be taken as business opportunities.\n\nBy helping our customers reduce their Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions across our portfolio and by reducing CO2 emissions in our own operations, our company aims to contribute to the trend towards a low-carbon economy. Recent legislative and governmental initiatives to mitigate climate change worldwide, especially in Europe through initiatives such as the Green Deal or Sustainable Finance, present an opportunity for our company."

        "output": "Scenario analysis - According to the TCFD Recommendations, our company's credit exposure (EXP) to carbon-related sectors represents 7.3% of our total credit exposure. Our transition risk assessment concentrates on the sectors of electric utilities and oil, gas & coal in Japan. The analysis timeframe spans until 2050, although the International Energy Agency (IEA) scenario only extends to 2040. The estimated cost increases under dynamic and static scenarios are approximately \u00a5120 billion and \u00a5310 billion, respectively. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios we considered are 8.5 (4\u00b0C) and 2.6 (2\u00b0C).\n\nIn evaluating potential impacts on our clients' businesses, we applied two scenarios: a static scenario, which assumes no change in the existing business structure, and a dynamic scenario, under which the business structure adapts to the transformation. Our analysis primarily focused on credit costs through 2050.\n\nWe utilized a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the rates at which typhoons and other storms result in wind and water-related building loss or damage. We then analyzed the potential direct (collateral value) and indirect (business stagnation) impacts on our company's credit costs from the loss or damage of mortgaged real estate (buildings) in Japan. This analysis targeted middle-market firms and SMEs in Japan. The impact on mortgage lending value was minimal, while the impact of business stagnation was \u00a552 billion at most under both 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C scenarios."

        "output": "After conducting a thorough ESG review, our company has formulated a new Strategic Framework (the 'framework') for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) matters. This framework aligns with our business strategy and our mission to help individuals maximize their potential, build wealth, and achieve their savings goals. The framework consists of three strategic pillars, each of which aligns with our business strategy. In each pillar, we have identified specific focus areas where our company can make a significant impact.\n\nOur company is dedicated to meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary duties through the new ESG framework and our long-term goals to decrease carbon emissions and support a fair transition. This approach will enable us to manage risk over the long term while contributing to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. We recognize that transition risk poses the most immediate and impactful financial risk and have initiated an analysis of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio. This analysis focused on investments where our company holds significant influence. Preliminary reports were generated using climate-related data and metrics supplied by a proprietary vendor tool. This process allows for a sector-by-sector breakdown of carbon footprint metrics and identification of the most carbon-intensive companies in our investment portfolio. Additionally, we have determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) for the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes in our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in markets with varying levels of development. Some markets boast diversified, service-led economies and mature financial markets, while others rely more heavily on primary and energy-intensive industries. Emerging markets have a greater dependence on fossil fuels for their energy generation and less developed financial systems. The energy transition in these regions is expected to progress more slowly than in advanced economies. This was emphasized by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), during a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. Mr. Menon stated, 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs, and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nOur commitment to reducing carbon emissions in our investment portfolio is balanced with an understanding of the unique challenges posed by the markets in which we operate. We aim to implement our strategy in a manner that acknowledges these realities and shares the financial and social burden of the transition fairly. Our support for an inclusive transition includes collaboration with various stakeholders. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we work with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale up domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group our company has co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to generate new ideas for scaling up investments to further the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."

        "output": "Our company's Direct Operations:\nRisk management is an essential process in our organization, encompassing all functions. We identify risks related to financial and market performance, operational performance, emergency preparedness and response, environment, health and safety compliance, and other areas. We evaluate risks based on their impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers, as well as regulatory requirements. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments evaluate domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. Additionally, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have reviewed potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. We have considered raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management discusses which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success. We also consult external stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. ISO 14001 defines an environmental aspect as an element of an organization's activities, products, or services that has or may have an impact on the environment. Our significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system. Each environmental aspect, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, is ranked from 0 through 4 based on criteria like severity, magnitude, probability, frequency, controllability, duration, employee concerns, community concerns, boundaries, business impact, and regulatory. The highest scores identify our significant impacts, which we focus on in more detail in our environmental management systems.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our suppliers of raw materials. As a global organization, we rely on various suppliers for raw materials, some of which may be subject to supply constraints due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the U.S., Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

        "output": "Our company's Approach to Enterprise Risk Management:\nRisk management is a crucial process in our organization, encompassing all functions. We identify and assess risks related to financial and market performance, operational efficiency, emergency preparedness and response, environmental compliance, and health and safety, among other areas. We prioritize risks based on their potential impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers, as well as regulatory requirements. Our Enterprise Risk Management program includes managing key enterprise risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments evaluate business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are assessed as part of our financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have reviewed potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. We have considered raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management discusses which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success. We also consult external stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. ISO 14001 defines an environmental aspect as an element of an organization's activities, products, or services that has or may have an impact on the environment. Our significant environmental impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system. Each environmental aspect, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, is ranked from 0 through 4 based on criteria like severity, magnitude, probability, frequency, controllability, duration, employee concerns, community concerns, boundaries, business impact, and regulatory. The highest scores identify our significant impacts, which we focus on in more detail in our environmental management systems.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our suppliers of raw materials. As a global organization, we rely on various suppliers for raw materials, some of which may be subject to supply constraints due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

        "output": "Our company conducts financial impact analysis on the top three physical risks, transition risks, and climate opportunities to formulate strategies in line with TCFD recommendations. Financial impact analysis of climaterelated risks primarily focuses on market and technology-related costs to reduce carbon emissions, aligning with our Net Zero Emissions by 2050 goal. This includes expenses on energy conservation or carbon reduction facilities, more expensive renewable energy or RECs, carbon credits, and additional costs due to uncertainties in the development of new energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies.\n\nPhysical risks mainly focus on growing electricity costs due to chronic climate changes, such as rising temperatures. Costs related to combating drought include expenses for building water reclamation systems, using reclaimed water, and purchasing backup water sources. For acute climate change disasters like floods and strong winds, we have already designed prevention systems into our facilities and will not be calculating their financial impact.\n\nOur company has also estimated the cost of reputation damage from failing to meet net zero emission targets. However, there is no globally recognized approach to estimate such financial impact, and these calculations are subject to uncertainty. The financial impact of a 1% revenue reduction was a consensus reached by experts after discussions and assessments.\n\nThe financial impact of climate opportunities includes reduced costs from increased energy and water use efficiency and diverse water sources, as well as additional income from providing low-carbon products and services. These may include advanced manufacturing processes, Power Management ICs (PMICs), and ultralow power (ULP) ICs.\n\nAnalysis results indicate that developing low-carbon products and services presents the greatest opportunity for positive financial impacts, as demands for such products continue to grow."

We prioritize risks based on their potential impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being an integral part of this process.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments evaluate domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. Additionally, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is consulted to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, our reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

Strategic planning enables us to assess potential risks prior to major business decisions, while management reporting facilitates closer monitoring of risks as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management, and any deficiencies are addressed through appropriate measures.\n\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-focused, integrated throughout the organization, and addresses both risks and opportunities. It adheres to globally recognized standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO Standard 31000, and is customized to our specific needs. The frameworks link risk management with our financial reporting process and internal control system. They consider our strategy, operational efficiency, financial reporting reliability, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations as equally important.\n\nOur risk management process aims for early identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially impact our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we employ a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities that remain after the implementation of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified using a structured approach, combining both top-down and bottom-up methods. Reporting follows a regular quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues promptly.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on their impact and likelihood, considering various perspectives, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements.

Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. The first step in assuming responsibility for a risk or opportunity involves selecting one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies for risks include avoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance. Our general response strategy for opportunities is to \"seize\" the opportunity. In the second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures must be tailored to enable effective risk management.\n\nWe have developed various response measures with distinct characteristics. For instance, we mitigate the risk of currency and interest rate fluctuations through hedging activities. In managing our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, provisional acceptances during project execution, and clearly defined approval processes helps us identify and respond to project risks early, even before the bidding phase. Additionally, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential damage and liability risks to minimize our exposure to such risks and avoid or mitigate potential losses.\n\nWe address the risk of economic activity and customer demand fluctuations by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries and adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures as necessary.\n\nGlobal risks include the transmission of infectious agents from animals to humans, from humans to humans, and in other ways. Epidemics, pandemics, or other spread patterns, such as bioterrorism, pose a threat to causing high disease rates in different countries, regions, or continents. We continually monitor information from the World Health Organization (WHO), the American and European Centers for Disease Control, the German Robert Koch Institute, and other institutions to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible."

This framework aligns with our business strategy and our mission to help individuals maximize their potential, build wealth, and achieve their financial goals. The framework consists of three strategic pillars, each with a clear connection to our business strategy. In each pillar, we have identified focus areas where our company can make a significant impact.\n\nWe are confident that our new ESG framework and our commitment to reducing carbon emissions and supporting a fair transition are essential steps for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and discharge our fiduciary duties. This approach will enable us to manage risk over the long term while contributing to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. We have initiated an analysis of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio, focusing on investments where we have control and influence over the investment process. Preliminary reports have been generated using climate-related data and metrics provided by a vendor tool. This analysis allows us to identify the sectors contributing to the carbon footprint of our asset book and pinpoint the most carbon-intensive companies. We have also calculated the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) for the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes of our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in markets with varying levels of development. Some markets have advanced, service-oriented economies and well-established financial markets, while others rely more on primary industries and energy-intensive sectors. In emerging markets, the energy transition is likely to progress more slowly than in advanced economies. This was emphasized by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of a Southeast Asian country (MAS), during a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. Mr. Menon stated that 'Emerging economies are at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to basic necessities like electricity, modern sanitation, and clean water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most emerging economies are still heavily reliant on fossil fuels for their energy needs, and it is unrealistic to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy overnight.'\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are dedicated to reducing carbon emissions in our investment portfolio, we recognize the need to implement this strategy in a manner that acknowledges the unique challenges of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition equitably. Our commitment to an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities to all our stakeholders. We understand the importance of collaboration in driving an inclusive transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we collaborate with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in Southeast Asia, to scale up domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group our company has co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to generate new ideas for scaling up investments to further the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."

This framework aligns with our business strategy and our goal of enhancing people's lives by making healthcare more accessible and affordable, helping them build wealth, and enabling them to save for their goals.\n\nOur framework consists of three strategic pillars, which align closely with our business strategy. Within each pillar, we have identified specific focus areas where we believe our company can make a significant impact.

This approach will help us reduce our exposure to asset risk, including transition risk, over time, while also contributing to global decarbonization efforts. Recognizing that transition risk represents the most immediate and impactful financial risk to our company, we have conducted an initial analysis of the transition risk associated with our investments where we have direct control and influence. Preliminary reports were generated using climate-related data and metrics provided by a proprietary vendor tool. This information allows us to assess the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio and identify the sectors and companies with the highest carbon intensity, which are most at risk of being stranded. It also enables us to determine and monitor the carbon intensity of our listed equity and corporate bond asset classes.\n\nOur company operates in various markets, including mature economies with diversified, service-led economies and well-established financial markets, as well as emerging markets that are more reliant on primary and energy-intensive industries. These emerging markets have a greater dependence on fossil fuels for energy generation and less developed financial systems. The energy transition in these regions is expected to progress more slowly than in advanced economies.\n\nGiven this context, we are committed to decarbonizing our investment portfolio but recognize the need to implement this strategy in a manner that acknowledges the unique characteristics of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition fairly. Our support for an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders.\n\nWe understand the importance of collaboration in driving an inclusive transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), we collaborate with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to increase domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition.

In addition, we have also included potential growth in carbon emissions from expanding our operations and new facilities as well as existing carbon reduction actions into general evaluations to analyze the potential financial impacts of climate risks. In the past, we evaluated climate risks solely using the worst-case scenario, but the future of climate change is highly unpredictable. As such, we have opted to evaluate climate risks across several scenarios this year to help map out and communicate operations strategies internally and give comprehensive insights into climate trends over the mid-to-long term.\n\nClimate Scenario Selection\n\nIn terms of transition risks, there is now a global consensus that carbon pricing schemes are a necessary policy to achieve net zero emissions. We referenced a commonly used report by a global energy organization, similar to the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO) published by the IEA, and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to conduct climate scenario analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing then serves as the basis for us to evaluate the impacts of carbon pricing schemes on our locations in different countries.\n\nIn terms of physical risks, we referenced the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) published by a generic scientific body similar to the IPCC in 2021 and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes in the future. We also adopted a generic scenario framework, such as the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP), to derive GHG emissions under different social and economic landscapes.

We have established enterprise-wide processes for strategic planning and management reporting to help identify potential risks prior to major business decisions and monitor risks more closely as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly assess the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management, and any deficiencies can be addressed through appropriate measures.\n\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-oriented, and is integrated into our organization. It addresses both risks and opportunities. Our approach is based on globally accepted standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO 31000, and is adapted to our company's specific needs. The frameworks connect our risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system.\n\nOur risk management process aims for early identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially affect our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues in a timely manner.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on impact and likelihood, considering different perspectives, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational units. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. Our response strategies include avoidance, transfer, reduction, acceptance, and seizing opportunities. For each risk or opportunity, responsibility involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures are specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe address various risks, including those related to economic activity and customer demand, project risks, and risks from the transmission of infectious agents. We closely monitor macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries to address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand. We maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure and avoid or minimize potential losses. We constantly check information from relevant institutions to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible."

This framework aligns with our business strategy and our mission to help individuals maximize their potential, build wealth, and achieve their financial goals. The framework consists of three strategic pillars, each with a distinct focus area where our company can make a significant impact.\n\nOur company is dedicated to meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary duties through this new ESG framework. By implementing long-term goals to decrease the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio and support a fair transition, we aim to minimize asset risk, including transition risk, over time. We have initiated a preliminary analysis of transition risk within our investment assets, focusing on those where we hold direct control and can exert influence. This assessment utilizes climate-related data and metrics from a proprietary vendor tool, allowing us to evaluate the carbon contribution of various sectors and identify the most carbon-intensive sectors and companies within our portfolio. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) for our listed equity and corporate bond asset classes.\n\nOur company operates in various markets, including mature economies with diversified services and advanced financial markets and emerging markets that are more reliant on primary industries and energy-intensive sectors. The energy transition in these emerging markets is expected to progress at a slower pace compared to advanced economies. Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), emphasized this point during a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. He noted that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to basic necessities like electricity, modern sanitation, and clean water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow, most Asian economies are still heavily reliant on fossil fuels for their energy needs, and it is unrealistic to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy overnight.'\n\nOur commitment to decarbonizing our investment portfolio is balanced with the understanding of the unique challenges posed by the markets in which we operate. We aim to contribute to a fair and inclusive transition by sharing the financial and social burden with all our stakeholders. We recognize the importance of collaboration in driving an inclusive transition and are a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD. Through the SDIP, we work with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale up sustainable infrastructure investments and promote energy transition. The SDIP's ASEAN Hub, which our company has co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to generate new ideas for scaling up investments to further the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."

Decarbonization is expected to bring about significant changes to the energy value chain in the coming decades. We aim to offer innovative technologies to facilitate this transition. This requires a deep understanding of the technological changes and costs that will be necessary over the next 30 + years. To accomplish this, we have developed comprehensive multi-modal simulation tools. We have compared the results of these tools with external research studies, such as IRENA, Fraunhofer, IHS, Agora Energiewende, and IEA.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we have conducted scenario analysis as a stress test on our carbon neutral program to ensure its resilience to higher energy or CO2 prices. Our experts applied high-price scenarios using IHS Autonomy, IEA Sustainable Development Scenario, and the Greenpeace Energy Revolution scenario to identify potential risks to our CO2-reduction plan. By utilizing predictions on energy prices from these scenarios and a forecast for CO2 prices from the High-Level Commission on Carbon-Pricing, we evaluated necessary adjustments. The results of the analysis showed that our existing program is sufficiently resilient.\n\nClimate-related scenario analysis enables our business to anticipate potential consequences from regulatory changes, R&D, and customer trends and requirements. In fiscal 2020, we performed forward-looking scenario analysis in accordance with the TCFD recommendation. In addition to IHS scenarios, we applied the IEA SDS scenarios, focusing on indicators such as renewable uptake, decentralization, energy efficiency demand, and CO2 prices for 2020-2040. The analysis did not influence our strategy but strongly confirmed it. The results revealed that our portfolio is resilient to climate change. In fact, the majority of our portfolio benefits from energy transformation, including Virtual Power Plants (VPP), Decentralized Energy Systems (DES), future grids, Digital Grids, and storage, even more so in the next decades."

The framework consists of three strategic pillars, each with a clear connection to our business strategy. In each pillar, we have identified specific focus areas where our company can make a significant impact.\n\nWe are confident that our new ESG framework and our long-term goals to decarbonize our investment portfolio and support a fair transition are essential for meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary duties. This approach will help us minimize asset risk, including transition risk, over time, while also contributing to global decarbonization efforts. Acknowledging that transition risk represents the most immediate and impactful financial risk, we have conducted an initial transition risk analysis on our investment assets. This analysis focused on investments where our company holds significant influence over the investment process. Preliminary reports were generated using climate-related data and metrics from a proprietary vendor tool. This analysis allows us to identify the carbon footprint contributions of various sectors in our investment portfolio and pinpoint the most carbon-intensive sectors, which are at the highest risk of being stranded. It also enables us to determine and monitor the most carbon-intensive companies in our investment portfolio. We have also calculated the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) for our listed equity and corporate bond asset classes.\n\nOur company operates in diverse markets, including mature economies with service-led industries and advanced financial markets, as well as emerging markets that are more reliant on primary and energy-intensive industries. These emerging markets have a greater dependence on fossil fuels for their energy generation and less developed financial systems. The energy transition in these regions is expected to progress at a slower pace than in advanced economies. This was emphasized by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), during a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. Mr. Menon stated that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs, and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are committed to decarbonizing our investment portfolio, we recognize the importance of implementing this strategy in a manner that acknowledges the unique challenges of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition equitably. Our commitment to a fair transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We understand the importance of collaboration in driving a fair transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we collaborate with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group our company has co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to catalyze new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."

For climate scenario analysis, we can run 30-year scenarios for both Physical and Transition Risk. Some elements of our Physical Risk scenario analysis can also extend to 2100.\n\nMethods for identifying material risks and opportunities: We utilize a range of tools and methodologies to assess Transition and Physical Climate Risk for our clients, portfolios, and our own operations. These include scenario analysis, location-based hazard and risk scores, temperature alignment scores, and Munich Re's NATHAN tool (acute physical risk impact assessments). In addition, we engage with corporate clients to understand their transition and physical risks, as well as their plans to prepare for climate change. In 2022, we continued to enhance our understanding of climate-related risks and significantly strengthened our stress testing and scenario analysis abilities for a range of management scenarios that are more plausible.\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities identified: Our company has assessed the impact of Climate Risk on our business using scenario analysis over a 30-year time horizon, which has enabled us to identify and mitigate climate risks which may manifest. Sustainability and climate change have become value drivers, providing an opportunity to deploy our market and industry knowledge to advise clients on their individual sustainability journeys. Sustainable finance is an opportunity to both defend our existing business from Transition Risk and to fund clients' transition from a high-carbon present to a low-carbon future. Through supporting clients on their net zero journeys and providing further finance to clients as they adapt to be less carbon intensive and emitting over time, we help mitigate their, and our, Transition Risk. Our goal is to achieve $1 billion in Sustainable Finance income by 2025 and to mobilize $300 billion of Sustainable Finance by 2030.

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a benchmark year. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nTogether with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in a certain country has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the rainy season, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

        "output": "Our company's Direct Operations:\nRisk management in our organization encompasses all functions, including evaluating risks related to financial and market performance, operational performance, emergency preparedness and response, environmental compliance, and regulatory impacts. We prioritize risks based on their potential impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being part of this process.\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are evaluated as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is consulted to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with global climate targets to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our policies and procedures, including our Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy, help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, our reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward energy-efficient technologies that use our products due to the anticipated increased adoption of these technologies in response to climate change."

It enhances our understanding of climate change, enables us to plan for the future, and helps us meet our growing regulatory requirements. In 2022, we conducted our initial internal climate scenario analysis exercise, employing four scenarios to represent the spectrum of potential climate change outcomes. This analysis focused on the key regions where our company operates and evaluated the impact on our balance sheet between the 2022 and 2050 timeframe.\n\nKey performance drivers and their consideration: Climate scenario analysis allows us to model how different potential climate pathways may influence our customer base and investment portfolios, primarily in terms of credit losses. Under the Current Commitments scenario, we anticipate moderate levels of losses related to transition risks. However, the rise in global warming will result in increasing levels of physical risk losses in later years.\n\nGovernment policies and their role in scenarios: The assumptions for our climate stress testing exercise encompass varying levels of governmental climate policy changes, macroeconomic factors, and technological developments. However, these scenarios hinge on the development of technologies that are still uncertain, such as global hydrogen production to decarbonize aviation and shipping. For more information on the assumptions, please refer to our ESG Data Pack.\n\nAdapting strategies in response to climate scenarios: The nature of the scenarios, our evolving capabilities, and the limitations of the analysis result in indicative outcomes of climate change headwinds, although they do not represent a direct forecast. Developments in climate science, data, methodology, and scenario analysis techniques will help us refine our approach further. Consequently, we anticipate this perspective on risk to evolve over time. Our company intends to continue enhancing our capabilities for climate scenario analysis and employ the results for decision-making, particularly in relation to strategy, by utilizing the range of scenario analysis outcomes to shape our strategy across business units and regions. Currently, we do not fully disclose the impacts of transition and physical risk quantitatively due to transitional challenges, including data limitations and evolving science and methodologies."

ERM employs a net risk approach and encompasses risks and opportunities that persist following the implementation of existing risk mitigation measures.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are ranked according to their potential impact and probability. Responsibilities are delegated for all significant risks and opportunities, with the extent of responsibility contingent on the magnitude of the respective risk or opportunity. The assessment timeframe typically spans three years, but we also monitor emerging risks and opportunities beyond three years, extending up to a century, using our long-term forward-looking ERM radar feature.

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a benchmark year. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nThe collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our water strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in a certain country has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the rainy season, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low, due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

        "output": "Our company's Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives are overseen by the Board, which determines strategy and priority areas. The Board recognizes the importance of senior executive involvement and holistic oversight of ESG matters material to our organization. In 2020, a Group ESG Committee was established to provide this involvement and oversight. The Committee is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and includes senior representatives from various business units and functional areas. One of the Group ESG Committee's responsibilities is to oversee our progress towards fulfilling our commitment to report against the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In 2020, the Group ESG Committee reported to the Board through the Nomination & Governance Committee.\n\nThe Board acknowledges that the next 12 to 18 months are critical for the implementation of our ESG Strategic Framework and related matters, such as the development and embedding of our purpose and values, diversity and inclusion (D&I) priorities, and employee engagement activities. In early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight during this period.\n\nOur policies and procedures for managing ESG issues are outlined in our Group Governance Manual (GGM). The GGM is subject to an annual formal content review, taking into consideration internal and external factors. Any instances of GGM non-compliance identified through annual attestations are assessed by policy owners and reported to the Group Audit Committee.\n\nOur company believes that our new strategic ESG framework and long-term goals to decarbonize our investment portfolio and support an inclusive transition are essential for meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary obligations. This approach will reduce our exposure to asset risk, including transition risk, over time, while also contributing to global decarbonization efforts. Our Risk function conducted an initial transition risk analysis on insurance assets managed in segregated portfolios by our asset managers. This analysis focused on investments where we maintain direct control and exert influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to our overall carbon footprint metrics and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded. It also enables the identification and monitoring of the most carbon-intensive companies held in our asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of our listed equity and corporate bond asset classes.\n\nThe Board's oversight of climate change risk has been significantly strengthened. In 2020, ESG was overseen by the Board through the Nomination & Governance Committee. In early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established until May 2022 to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight of ESG matters (including climate change). A Board Risk Committee workshop was held to evaluate the climate change risks facing our organization, discuss transition and physical risk concepts, and review potential Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)."

        "input": "Answer the following questions: \n1. Corporate risk management framework\n",
        "output": "Our company has established and coordinated a set of risk management and control systems to identify and address developments that may threaten our business continuity. These systems consist of enterprise-wide processes for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning enables us to assess potential risks prior to major business decisions, while management reporting allows us to closely monitor these risks as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management, and any deficiencies are addressed through appropriate measures. This coordination of processes and procedures aims to keep the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board informed about significant risks in a timely manner.\n\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-focused, integrated into the organization, and covers both risks and opportunities. It is based on globally recognized standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO Standard 31000, and is customized to our specific needs. The frameworks connect the risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system. They consider our strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of our business operations, the reliability of our financial reporting, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important.\n\nOur risk management process aims for early identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially impact the achievement of our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities that remain after the implementation of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a structured manner, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues in a timely manner.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on their impact and likelihood, considering different impact perspectives, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if deemed relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each organizational unit. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. The first step in assuming responsibility for a risk or opportunity involves choosing one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies for risks include avoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance. Our general response strategy for opportunities is to \"seize\" the opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures must be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe have developed a range of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates through hedging activities. Regarding our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and clearly defined approval processes, helps us identify and respond to project risks at an early stage, even before the bidding phase. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure to such risks and to avoid or minimize potential losses.\n\nWe address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries and adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary.\n\nThere are global risks from the transmission of infectious agents from animals to humans, from humans to humans, and in other ways. Epidemics, pandemics, or other spread patterns, such as bioterrorism, threaten to cause high disease rates in different countries, regions, or continents. We continuously monitor information from the World Health Organization (WHO), the American and European Centers for Disease Control, the German Robert Koch Institute, and other institutions to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible."

The framework consists of three strategic pillars, each with a focus area where our company can make a significant impact.\n\nWe are confident that this new ESG framework and our commitment to decarbonizing our investment portfolio and supporting an inclusive transition will meet stakeholder expectations and uphold our fiduciary responsibilities. By reducing our exposure to asset risk, including transition risk, over time, we will contribute to global decarbonization efforts. Recognizing the significance of transition risk, we have conducted a preliminary analysis on our investment assets. This analysis focused on investments where our company holds direct control and exerts influence over the investment process. We used climate-related data and metrics from a proprietary vendor tool to assess the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio and identify the most carbon-intensive sectors and companies. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of our listed equity and corporate bond asset classes.\n\nOur company operates in various markets, including mature economies with diversified, service-led industries and emerging markets that are more reliant on primary and energy-intensive industries. The energy transition in emerging markets is likely to progress at a slower pace than in advanced economies. Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), emphasized this point during a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. He noted that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs, and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nOur commitment to decarbonizing our investment portfolio is balanced by our understanding of the unique challenges posed by the markets in which we operate. We aim to share the financial and social burden of the transition in a fair manner and recognize the importance of coalition building in delivering an inclusive transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), we collaborate with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP's ASEAN Hub, which our company has co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to catalyze new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."

        "output": "Our initial approach to managing climate risk involved understanding the physical and transition impacts across five priority risk areas: wholesale credit risk, retail credit risk, reputational risk, resilience risk, and regulatory compliance risk. Process - We have integrated climate risk into our existing risk framework, and incorporated it into the policies and controls for the relevant risks where appropriate. We recognize the need for enhanced capabilities and new sources of data.\n\nWe consider greenwashing to be an emerging risk that is likely to increase over time, as we develop capabilities and offerings to help our clients transition to a low-carbon economy. We also acknowledge that green finance taxonomies are not consistent globally, and evolving taxonomies and practices could result in revisions in our sustainable finance reporting going forward.\n\nWe use stress testing and scenario analysis to assess how these climate risks will impact our customers, business, and infrastructure. Integration into policies and procedures - In 2022, we incorporated climate considerations into our mortgage origination process for our retail mortgage business and new money request process for our key wholesale businesses. We also continued to enhance our climate risk scoring tool, which will enable us to assess our customers\u2019 exposures to climate risk. We published our updated energy policy, covering various sectors, and updated our thermal coal phase-out policy.\n\nWe are integrating climate risk into the policies, processes, and controls across many areas of our organization, and we will continue to update these as our climate risk management capabilities mature over time. Consider climate-related risks in traditional banking industry risk categories (supplementary guidance for banks) - In 2022, we expanded our scope to consider climate risk impacts on our other risk areas (including treasury risk and traded risk) in our risk framework. We also analyzed in our internal scenario analysis exercise how climate risks impact how we manage other risks within our organization, including credit risk, and on an exploratory basis: market, operational, liquidity, insurance, and pension risks.\n\nAt our company, we are committed to managing climate risk in a comprehensive and proactive manner. We recognize the importance of addressing the physical and transition risks associated with climate change, and we are continually enhancing our capabilities to assess and manage these risks. We also understand the need for transparency and consistency in our reporting and disclosures related to climate risk, and we will continue to engage with stakeholders to build trust and confidence in our approach.\n\nGreenwashing is an emerging risk that we take seriously, and we are committed to ensuring that our offerings and communications are transparent and accurate. We acknowledge that the taxonomies and practices related to sustainable finance are evolving, and we will continue to adapt our reporting and disclosures to reflect these changes.\n\nThrough the use of stress testing and scenario analysis, we are able to assess the potential impact of climate risks on our customers, business, and infrastructure. We are also integrating climate risk into our policies, processes, and controls across many areas of our organization, and we will continue to update these as our capabilities and understanding of climate risk evolve.\n\nIn addition to the five priority risk areas mentioned earlier, we are also considering the impact of climate risk on other traditional banking industry risk categories, including treasury risk, traded risk, credit risk, market risk, operational risk, liquidity risk, insurance risk, and pension risk. We believe that a comprehensive approach to managing climate risk is essential for the long-term success and sustainability of our business."

        "output": "Processes used to determine material risks and opportunities: Our company has developed capabilities to execute climate stress testing and scenario analysis to improve our understanding of risk exposures for risk management and business decision making. Due to challenges in data sourcing and processes, there have been impacts on certain climate disclosures.\n\nClimate scenario analysis is used as a risk assessment tool to provide insights on the long-term effects of transition and physical risks across our corporate and retail banking portfolios, as well as our own operations. Our sustainable finance ambition enables sustainable infrastructure and energy systems, promotes decarbonisation efforts across the real economy, and enhances investor capital through sustainable investment.\n\nWe aim to achieve net zero in our financed emissions by 2050 and in our own operations and supply chain by 2030. We aim to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn of sustainable finance and investment for our customers in their transition to net zero and a sustainable future.\n\nOur assessment of climate risks covers three distinct time periods: short term (up to 2025), medium term (2026 to 2035), and long term (2036 to 2050). Transition or physical climate-related issues identified are assessed using enhanced questionnaires and scoring tools.\n\nWe support our customers in their transition through our sustainable finance and investment ambition. Our sustainable finance data dictionary includes a detailed definition of contributing activities.\n\nCertain perils, such as coastal, river, and surface water flooding, drive potential credit losses in our retail portfolio. Around 20% of our financed properties are in London, and most are protected by the Thames Barrier.\n\nWe identified six key sectors with the highest exposure to climate transition risk: automotive, chemicals, construction and building materials, metals and mining, oil and gas, and power and utilities. We continued to improve our identification and assessment of climate risk within our retail mortgage portfolio, with increased investments in physical risk data and enhancements to our internal risk assessment capabilities and models.\n\nOpportunities include sustainable finance, sustainable investment, and sustainable infrastructure. For a detailed breakdown of our sustainable finance progress by geography, see the ESG Data Pack.\n\nWe report our exposure to high transition risk sectors in our wholesale portfolio. Since 2020, we have rolled out the questionnaire to include our largest customers in the next highest climate transition risk sectors: agriculture, industrials, real estate, and transportation.\n\nAs a result of climate scenario analysis, our largest and most impacted sectors \u2013 power and utilities, construction and building materials, and chemicals \u2013 are subject to increased levels of transition risks. Our asset management division is increasingly considering both physical and transition risks and integrating ESG and climate analysis into the investment decision-making process.\n\nTransition to net zero represents one of our strategic pillars. We aim to be net zero in our operations and supply chain by 2030 and in our financed emissions by 2050. Scenario analysis supports our strategy by assessing our position under a range of climate scenarios and helping us plan for the future and meet growing regulatory requirements.\n\nWe continue to develop our climate scenario analysis exercises to have a more comprehensive understanding of climate headwinds, risks, and opportunities that will support our strategic planning and actions. We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of climate-related issues on financial planning, particularly the impact on financial performance and financial position. We expect to further enhance our disclosure and processes in relation to acquisitions/divestments in the medium term.\n\nClimate change poses a physical risk to the buildings we occupy as an organization, including offices, retail branches, and data centers. We use stress testing to evaluate the potential impact to our owned or leased premises. Our scenario stress test, conducted in 2022, analyzed how seven different climate change-related hazards could impact 500 of our critical and important buildings.\n\nOur Climate Solutions Partnership is a philanthropic initiative that aims to identify and remove barriers to scale for climate change solutions. We support start-up companies developing carbon-cutting technologies, nature-based solutions, renewable energy initiatives in Asia, and the WWF-led Asia Sustainable Palm Oil Links programme.\n\nDuring Board meetings, we balance discussions on the company's performance, emerging risks, and duties to shareholders while remaining conscious of responsibilities to support communities and help customers. In 2022, the Board approved an update to the thermal coal phase-out policy and the publication of an updated energy policy. We have committed to publishing our own climate transition plan in 2023.

        "output": "Our Company's Direct Operations:\nRisk management is an essential process in our organization, encompassing all functions. We evaluate risks related to financial and market performance, operational efficiency, emergency preparedness and response, environmental compliance, and health and safety. We prioritize risks based on their potential impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers, as well as regulatory requirements. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments evaluate domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. Additionally, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have reviewed potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. We have considered raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management discusses which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success. We also consult external stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. ISO 14001 defines an environmental aspect as an element of an organization's activities, products, or services that has or may have an impact on the environment. Our significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system. Each environmental aspect, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, is ranked from 0 through 4 based on criteria like severity, magnitude, probability, frequency, controllability, duration, employee concerns, community concerns, boundaries, business impact, and regulatory. The highest scores identify our significant impacts, which we focus on in more detail in our environmental management systems.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our suppliers of raw materials. As a global organization, we rely on various suppliers for raw materials, some of which may be subject to supply constraints due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the production of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

We identify and assess risks related to financial and market performance, operational efficiency, emergency preparedness and response, environmental sustainability, health and safety compliance, and regulatory impacts. We prioritize risks based on their potential impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program includes the identification, assessment, prioritization, and management of key enterprise risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments evaluate business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks for our organization. These risks are reviewed as part of our financial disclosure requirements. Departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to our major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered. We have also evaluated raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is consulted to discuss relevant aspects for our future success. External stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our suppliers of raw materials. As we source raw materials globally, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our supplier selection process, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, reducing our risk of business interruptions and lowering transportation emission impacts.\n\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents an opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest our business focus. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

        "output": "Our Company's Direct Operations:\nRisk management is an essential process in our business, encompassing all functions. We evaluate risks related to financial and market performance, operational performance, emergency preparedness and response, environment, health and safety compliance, and regulatory impacts. We prioritize risks based on their impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are evaluated as part of financial disclosure requirements. Departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered. We have also evaluated raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is consulted to discuss relevant aspects for our future success. External stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, reducing our risk of business interruptions and lowering transportation emission impacts.\n\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents an opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest our business focus. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

Furthermore, we have incorporated the potential increase in carbon emissions from expanding our operations and new facilities, as well as existing carbon reduction measures, into our evaluations to examine the potential financial consequences of climate risks. Previously, we assessed climate risks based on the worst-case scenario alone. However, the future of climate change is uncertain, and as a result, we have chosen to evaluate climate risks under multiple scenarios this year to help shape and communicate internal strategies, as well as to offer a comprehensive understanding of climate trends over the medium-to-long term.\n\nClimate Scenario Selection\nRegarding transition risks, there is now a global agreement that carbon pricing mechanisms are essential for achieving net zero emissions. We consulted the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO), an IEA report widely used by companies worldwide, and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to conduct climate risk analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing serves as the foundation for us to evaluate the effects of carbon pricing schemes on our operations in various countries.\n\nIn terms of physical risks, we consulted the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) published by IPCC in 2021 and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes in the future. We also adopted the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) to derive GHG emissions under different social and economic contexts.

        "output": "Our company has established and coordinated a set of risk management and control systems to support the early recognition of potential threats to our business continuity. These systems encompass enterprise-wide processes for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning enables us to consider potential risks before major business decisions, while management reporting allows us to monitor these risks more closely as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly assess the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management, and any deficiencies are addressed through appropriate measures. This coordination of processes and procedures aims to keep our Managing Board and Supervisory Board informed about significant risks in a timely manner.\n\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-oriented, integrated into the organization, and addresses both risks and opportunities. It is based on globally accepted standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO Standard 31000, and is adapted to our specific needs. The frameworks connect the risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system. They consider our strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of our business operations, the reliability of our financial reporting, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important.\n\nOur risk management process aims for early identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially impact our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues in a timely manner.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized in terms of impact and likelihood, considering different impact perspectives, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed regarding potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational units mentioned above. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the hierarchical level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. In a first step, assuming responsibility for a specific risk or opportunity involves choosing one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies with respect to risks are avoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance of the relevant risk. Our general response strategy with respect to opportunities is to \"seize\" the relevant opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures have to be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates by engaging in hedging activities. Regarding our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and complemented by clearly defined approval processes, assists us in identifying and responding to project risks at an early stage. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential cases of damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure to such risks and to avoid or minimize potential losses.\n\nWe address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries and adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary.\n\nOur company constantly checks information from reputable sources, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the American and European Centers for Disease Control, and the German Robert Koch Institute, to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible."

We plan to begin this transition starting in 2030, with more aggressive targets for thermal coal emissions set for 2024. Our progress can be found in the Financed emission section.\n\u2022 In terms of climate-related opportunities, we have set a $1 billion Sustainable Finance income target and a $300 billion mobilization of Sustainable Finance targets, with deadlines extending to 2025 and 2030, respectively.\n\u2022 During the year, we updated the measurement of our Oil and gas sector emissions from income-based carbon intensity to absolute financed emissions. This adjustment was made to provide a more accurate representation of the sector's emission profile and establish a carbon budget intended to decrease over time.\n\u2022 In 2022, we expanded the scope of our financed emissions calculations and, in this report, we announce three new sectoral targets covering transportation. By 2030, we aim to reduce emissions in the transportation sector:\n  \u2013 34% reduction in aviation (production intensity)\n  \u2013 Reduce our alignment delta in shipping from +2.6% to 0%\n  \u2013 49% reduction in automotive manufacturers (production intensity)\nDescription of methodologies used to calculate targets and measures:\n\u2022 The methodologies used to calculate baseline emissions are detailed in the Our Financed Emissions section.\nOther key performance indicators used:\n\u2022 In 2021, we introduced Sustainability Aspirations, which include an interim target to aim for net zero in our operations by 2025 and in our financed emissions by 2050.

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For example, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate on a yearly basis 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the US, Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our company's Siemens Water Tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nIn addition to our own operations, natural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

We are committed to providing innovative technologies to facilitate this transformation of the energy value chain over the next few decades. To achieve this, we have developed comprehensive multi-modal simulation tools and compared the results with external research studies, such as International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Fraunhofer, IHS, Agora Energiewende, and International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nRegarding our own operations, we conducted scenario analysis as a stress test on our carbon neutral program to ensure its resilience to higher energy or CO2-prices. Our experts applied high-price scenarios using various sources, including industry reports from IHS Autonomy and the IEA Sustainable Development Scenario, as well as the Greenpeace Energy Revolution scenario. By utilizing predictions on energy prices from these scenarios and a forecast for CO2 prices from a High-Level Commission on Carbon-Pricing, we evaluated necessary adjustments. The results of the analysis showed that our existing program is sufficiently resilient.\n\nClimate-related scenario analysis enables our business to anticipate potential consequences from regulatory changes, R&D, and customer trends and requirements. In fiscal 2020, we performed forward-looking scenario analysis in accordance with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendation. Besides IHS scenarios, we applied the IEA SDS scenarios, examining indicators such as renewable uptake, decentralization, energy efficiency demand, and CO2 prices for 2020-2040. The project did not influence our strategy but strongly confirmed it. The analysis revealed that our portfolio is resilient to climate change. In fact, the majority of our portfolio benefits from energy transformation, including Virtual Power Plants (VPP), Decentralized Energy Systems (DES), future grids, Digital Grids (DG), and storage, and will even be stronger in the next decades."

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a benchmark year. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nTogether with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate on a yearly basis 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our company's internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in a certain country has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the rainy season, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nIn addition to our own operations, natural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

        "output": "After conducting a thorough ESG review, our company has established a new Strategic Framework (the 'framework'). This framework aligns with our business strategy and our mission to help individuals maximize their potential, build wealth, and achieve their savings goals. The framework consists of three strategic pillars, each with a clear connection to our business strategy. Within these pillars, we have identified focus areas where our company can make a significant impact.\n\nWe are confident that our new ESG strategic framework and our long-term goals to decrease carbon emissions and support a fair transition are essential for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and discharge our fiduciary duties. This framework will enable us to manage risk over time and contribute to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Given that transition risk represents the most immediate and impactful financial risk, we have assessed the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio. Our analysis focused on investments where our company holds significant influence and control over the investment process. Preliminary reports were generated using climate-related data and metrics provided by a proprietary vendor tool. This analysis provides a sector-by-sector breakdown of the carbon footprint metrics of our asset book and pinpoints the most carbon-intensive sectors. It also allows us to identify and monitor the most carbon-heavy companies in our asset book. We have also calculated the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) for the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes in our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in markets with varying levels of development. Some markets boast diversified, service-oriented economies and sophisticated financial systems, while others rely heavily on primary industries and energy-intensive sectors. In emerging markets, the energy transition is likely to progress at a slower pace than in advanced economies. This was emphasized by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), during a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. Mr. Menon stated that 'Emerging markets are at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to basic necessities like electricity, modern sanitation, and clean water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most emerging economies remain heavily reliant on fossil fuels for their energy needs, and it is unrealistic to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy overnight.'\n\nFor our company, this implies that while we are dedicated to reducing carbon emissions in our investment portfolio, we recognize the importance of implementing this strategy in a manner that acknowledges the unique characteristics of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition equitably. Our commitment to a fair transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We understand the significance of coalition building in driving a fair transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we collaborate with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale up domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group our company has co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to generate new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."

        "output": "Our initial approach to managing climate risk involved understanding the physical and transition impacts across five priority risk areas: wholesale credit risk, retail credit risk, reputational risk, resilience risk, and regulatory compliance risk. Process - We have integrated climate risk into our existing risk framework, and incorporated it into the policies and controls for the relevant risks where appropriate. We recognize the need for enhanced capabilities and new sources of data.\n\nWe consider greenwashing to be an emerging risk that is likely to increase over time, as we develop capabilities and offerings to help our clients transition to a low-carbon economy. We also acknowledge that green finance taxonomies are not consistent globally, and evolving taxonomies and practices could result in revisions in our sustainable finance reporting going forward.\n\nWe use stress testing and scenario analysis to assess how these climate risks will impact our customers, business, and infrastructure. Integration into policies and procedures - In 2022, we incorporated climate considerations into our mortgage origination process for our retail mortgage business and new money request process for our key wholesale businesses. We also continued to enhance our climate risk scoring tool, which will enable us to assess our customers\u2019 exposures to climate risk. We published our updated energy policy, covering various sectors, and updated our thermal coal phase-out policy.\n\nWe are integrating climate risk into the policies, processes, and controls across many areas of our organization, and we will continue to update these as our climate risk management capabilities mature over time.\n\nConsider climate-related risks in traditional banking industry risk categories (supplementary guidance for banks) - In 2022, we expanded our scope to consider climate risk impacts on our other risk areas (including treasury risk and traded risk) in our risk framework. We also analyzed in our internal scenario analysis exercise how climate risks impact how we manage other risks within our organization, including credit risk, and on an exploratory basis: market, operational, liquidity, insurance, and pension risks.\n\nAt our company, we take a proactive approach to managing climate risk and are committed to incorporating it into all aspects of our business. We recognize the importance of staying informed about the latest developments in climate risk and are continuously enhancing our capabilities to address these risks effectively."

This will be a company-wide initiative with involvement from our asset owner and asset manager business units, risk, actuarial, and government relations teams.\n\nScenario analysis will be a key focus area as we plan to incorporate it into our mainstream risk management processes during 2021 and report findings within management information at the company and business unit levels. As we explore how climate risk impacts our business in the long term, we aim to operationalize and increase the use of scenario testing. We plan to voluntarily run scenario tests emerging from regulators, such as exploratory climate risk scenarios for financial institutions in 2021.\n\nMany organizations have set targets in alignment with global climate goals. Our company is assessing similar targets in respect of the carbon emissions from our investments, given their significance within our overall emissions profile, and our commitment to decarbonizing our investment portfolio.\n\nIn the interim, we continue to increase our level of ambition in relation to our own emissions footprint. This year we have set new and stretching targets for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, with the aim of becoming net carbon neutral across these two scopes by the end of 2030. More information on the environmental impact of our direct operations is available in the Environmental section on page 46.\n\nDuring 2021, we will continue to scale up our engagement strategy with key policy and political stakeholders around major climate conferences, with a focus on financial sector issues to support the just transition and sustainable finance priorities, particularly in emerging markets. We also recognize that the implementation of our strategic ESG framework can generate opportunities for our company. Some of these opportunities will come through our efforts to take early mitigating action against the climate risks we identify, including incorporating transition risk into investment decisions to reduce the risk of being exposed to stranded assets. Others will come through supporting an inclusive transition. The infrastructure and capital expenditure required to enable the transition represents attractive investment opportunities in many cases. For example, there is a role for institutions to both develop new products and invest in structures and mechanisms that enable a managed withdrawal from reliance on coal-powered electricity within developing economies. In response to this, we have developed several responsible investment products that channel our customers\u2019 savings towards ESG-themed investments, such as the Asia Sustainable Bond Fund recently launched by Eastspring. More information on our ESG-related investment activity is available in the Responsible Investment section on page 34.\n\nA review is underway to assess suitable targets in respect of the carbon emissions from our investment portfolio.

One responsibility of the Group ESG Committee is to oversee our progress towards reporting against the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nOur policies and procedures for managing ESG issues are outlined in our Company Governance Manual (CGM). The CGM is subject to annual review and sets standards for managing potential ESG issues across the organization. Any instances of non-compliance with the CGM identified through annual attestations are assessed by policy owners and reported to the Audit Committee.\n\nWe believe that our new strategic ESG framework and long-term goals to decarbonize our investment portfolio and support an inclusive transition are essential for meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary obligations. This approach will reduce our exposure to asset risk, including transition risk, over time, while also contributing to global decarbonization efforts.\n\nOur Risk function conducted an initial transition risk analysis on insurance assets managed in segregated portfolios by our asset managers. This analysis focused on investments where we maintain direct control and exert influence over the investment process. Preliminary reports were generated using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This analysis facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to our overall carbon footprint metrics and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors and companies.\n\nOur Board's oversight of climate change risk has been significantly strengthened. ESG matters, including climate change, are now overseen by a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group, which ensures appropriate Board engagement and oversight until May 2022.

Strategic planning enables us to recognize potential risks prior to significant business decisions, while management reporting facilitates closer monitoring of risks as our business advances. Our internal auditors regularly evaluate the sufficiency and efficiency of our risk management, and any shortcomings can be remedied through suitable measures.\n\nOur risk management strategy is all-encompassing, dynamic, and management-focused, and is embedded within our organization. It encompasses both risks and opportunities. Our strategy adheres to globally recognized standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO 31000, and is customized to our company's specifications. The frameworks link our risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system.\n\nOur risk management process aims for early recognition and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially impact our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The timeframe is generally three years, and we employ a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities that remain following the implementation of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a systematic manner, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting typically follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues promptly.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on impact and probability, taking into account various viewpoints, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down component ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at various management levels and are incorporated into the subsequent reporting process, if deemed relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are assessed for potential cumulative effects and are consolidated within and for each of the departments mentioned. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. Our response strategies include avoidance, transfer, reduction, acceptance, and capitalizing on opportunities. For each risk or opportunity, responsibility entails the development, initiation, and monitoring of suitable response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures are specifically designed to facilitate effective risk management.\n\nOur company manages various risks, including those related to economic conditions and customer demand, project risks, and risks from the transmission of infectious agents. We closely monitor macroeconomic trends and developments in relevant industries to address the risk of economic instability and fluctuating customer demand. We maintain adequate insurance coverage for potential damage and liability risks to minimize our exposure and mitigate potential losses.

Decarbonization is expected to bring about significant changes to the energy value chain in the coming decades. We are committed to offering innovative technologies to facilitate this transition. To accomplish this, we have developed comprehensive multi-modal simulation tools. We have compared the outcomes of these tools with external research studies, such as IRENA, Fraunhofer, IHS, Agora Energiewende, and IEA.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we have conducted scenario analysis as a stress test on our carbon neutral program to ensure its resilience to higher energy or CO2 prices. Our experts applied high-price scenarios using various sources, including IHS Autonomy, IEA Sustainable Development Scenario, and the Greenpeace Energy Revolution scenario, to identify potential risks to our CO2-reduction plan. By utilizing predictions on energy prices from these scenarios and a forecast for CO2 prices from a High-Level Commission on Carbon-Pricing, we evaluated necessary adjustments. The results of the analysis showed that our existing program is sufficiently resilient.\n\nClimate-related scenario analysis enables our business to anticipate potential consequences from regulatory changes, R&D, and customer trends and requirements. In fiscal 2020, we performed forward-looking scenario analysis in accordance with the TCFD recommendation. In addition to IHS scenarios, we applied the IEA SDS scenarios, focusing on indicators such as renewable uptake, decentralization, energy efficiency demand, and CO2 prices for 2020-2040. The analysis did not influence our strategy but strongly confirmed it. The results revealed that our portfolio is resilient to climate change. In fact, the majority of our portfolio benefits from energy transformation, including Virtual Power Plants (VPP), Decentralized Energy Systems (DES), future grids, Digital Grids, and storage, even more so in the next decades."

        "output": "Our company does not see any significant transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nThe collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our water strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in a water-stressed country has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the rainy season, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low, due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

The carbon pricing scheme incorporates carbon costs into the impact valuations of our daily reduction measures and influences our investment decisions regarding new facilities. For instance, in 2022, we implemented 684 energy conservation measures across eight categories under our energy conservation program, saving approximately 700 GWh in energy that year.

Our transition risk assessment concentrates on the electric utilities and oil, gas & coal sectors in Japan. The analysis timeframe spans until 2050, although the International Energy Agency (IEA) scenario concludes in 2040. The estimated cost increases under dynamic and static scenarios are \u00a5120 billion and \u00a5310 billion, respectively. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios we considered are 8.5 (4\u00b0C) and 2.6 (2\u00b0C).\n\nIn evaluating potential implications for our clients' businesses, we applied two scenarios: a static one, assuming no business transformation, and a dynamic one, involving business structure adaptation. Our analysis primarily focused on credit costs through 2050.\n\nWe utilized a Monte Carlo simulation to ascertain the rates at which typhoons and other storms result in wind and water-related building loss or damage. Subsequently, we analyzed the potential direct (collateral value) and indirect (business stagnation) impacts on our company's credit costs from the loss or damage of mortgaged real estate (buildings) in Japan. This analysis targeted middle-market firms and SMEs in Japan. The impact on mortgage lending value was minimal, while the impact of business stagnation was \u00a552 billion at most under both 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C scenarios."

The Committee is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operening Officer, and includes the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, the HR Director, and senior representatives from our business units. One of the Group ESG Committee's responsibilities is to oversee our progress towards fulfilling our commitment to report against the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In 2020, the Group ESG Committee reported to the Board through the Nomination & Governance Committee.\n\nThe Board recognizes that the next 12 to 18 months are critical for the implementation of our ESG Strategic Framework. Therefore, in early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight during this period. The Working Group is chaired by a Non-executive Director and comprises four other Non-executive Directors.\n\nOur company's policies and procedures for managing Environmental, Social, and Governance issues are outlined in our Group Governance Manual. This manual is subject to an annual content review, taking into consideration both internal and external factors. Any instances of non-compliance with the manual identified by our businesses through their annual attestation are assessed by the policy owners and reported to the Group Audit Committee.\n\nWe believe that our new strategic ESG framework and long-term goals to reduce our carbon footprint and support an inclusive transition are essential for meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary obligations. This approach will help us reduce our exposure to asset risk over time while contributing to global decarbonization efforts. Our Risk function conducted an initial transition risk analysis on insurance assets managed in segregated portfolios by our asset managers. This analysis focused on investments where we maintain direct control and exert influence over the investment process. Preliminary reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to our overall carbon footprint metrics and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded. It also enables us to determine and monitor the most carbon-intensive companies held in our asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes of our insurance investment portfolio.\n\nThe Board's oversight of climate change risk has been significantly strengthened. In 2020, ESG was overseen by the Board through the Nomination & Governance Committee. In early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established until May 2022 to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight of ESG matters (including climate change). A Board Risk Committee workshop was held to evaluate the climate change risks facing our organization, discuss transition and physical risk concepts, and review potential Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)."

        "output": "Our company's Direct Operations:\nRisk management is a crucial process in our organization, encompassing all functions. We identify risks related to financial and market performance, operational efficiency, emergency preparedness and response, environmental compliance, and health and safety. We evaluate risks based on their potential impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers, as well as regulatory requirements. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments evaluate domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have reviewed potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. We have considered raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management discusses which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success. We also consult external stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. ISO 14001 defines an environmental aspect as an element of an organization's activities, products, or services that has or may have an impact on the environment. Our significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system. Each environmental aspect, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, is ranked from 0 through 4 based on criteria like severity, magnitude, probability, frequency, controllability, duration, employee concerns, community concerns, boundaries, business impact, and regulatory. The highest scores identify our significant impacts, which we focus on in more detail in our environmental management systems.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with global climate targets to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our suppliers of raw materials. As a global organization, we rely on various suppliers for raw materials, some of which may be subject to supply constraints due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the production of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nWe assess upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nWe assess downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward certain business areas due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

        "output": "Over the next three years, our company will work to enhance the management of climate risk throughout our organization. This will be a company-wide, cross-functional initiative involving participation from our asset owner and asset manager business units, risk, actuarial, and government relations teams.\n\nScenario analysis will be a key focus area as we plan to incorporate it into our mainstream risk management processes during 2021 and begin reporting findings within management information at the company and business unit levels. As we continue to examine how climate risk affects our business in the long term, we aim to implement and expand the use of scenario testing. We plan to voluntarily run scenario tests emerging from regulators, such as exploratory climate risk scenarios for financial institutions in 2021.\n\nMany organizations have established targets in alignment with global climate goals. Our company is in the process of evaluating similar targets regarding the carbon emissions from our investments, given their significance within our overall emissions profile, and our commitment to decarbonizing our investment portfolio.\n\nIn the interim, we continue to raise the bar in relation to our own emissions footprint. This year we have set new and challenging targets for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, with the goal of achieving net carbon neutrality across these two scopes by the end of 2030. More information on the environmental impact of our direct operations can be found in the Environmental section on page 46.\n\nDuring 2021, we will continue to intensify our engagement strategy with key policy and political stakeholders around major climate conferences, with a focus on financial sector issues to support the just transition and sustainable finance priorities, particularly in emerging markets. We also recognize that the implementation of our strategic ESG framework can generate opportunities for our company. Some of these opportunities will come through our efforts to take early mitigating action against the climate risks we identify, including incorporating transition risk into investment decisions to reduce the risk of being exposed to stranded assets. Others will come through supporting an inclusive transition. The infrastructure and capital expenditure required to enable the transition presents attractive investment opportunities in many cases. For example, there is a role for institutions to both develop new products and invest in structures and mechanisms that facilitate a managed withdrawal from reliance on coal-powered electricity within developing economies. In response to this, we have developed several responsible investment products that channel our customers\u2019 savings towards ESG-themed investments, such as the Asia Sustainable Bond Fund recently launched by [Company Name]. More information on our ESG-related investment activity can be found in the Responsible Investment section on page 34.\n\nA review is underway to establish suitable targets in respect of the carbon emissions from our investment portfolio. We are also exploring further environmental/climate risk opportunities, such as the development of investment, insurance and digital products to support climate risk management."

Decarbonization is expected to bring about significant changes to the energy value chain in the coming decades. We are committed to offering innovative technologies to facilitate this transition. This requires a deep understanding of the technological advancements and costs needed over the next 30 + years. To accomplish this, we have developed comprehensive multi-modal simulation tools. We have compared the outcomes of these tools with external research studies, such as IRENA, Fraunhofer, IHS, Agora Energiewende, and IEA.\nRegarding our own operations, we have conducted scenario analysis as a stress test on our carbon neutral program to ensure its resilience to higher energy or CO2 prices. Our experts applied high-price scenarios using IHS Autonomy, IEA Sustainable Development Scenario, and the Greenpeace Energy Revolution scenario to identify potential risks to our CO2-reduction plan. By utilizing predictions on energy prices from these scenarios and a forecast for CO2 prices from a High-Level Commission on Carbon-Pricing, we evaluated necessary adjustments. The results of the analysis demonstrated that our existing program is sufficiently resilient.\nClimate-related scenario analysis enables our business to anticipate potential consequences from regulatory changes, R&D, and customer trends and requirements. In fiscal 2020, we performed forward-looking scenario analysis in accordance with the TCFD recommendation. In addition to IHS scenarios, we applied the IEA SDS scenarios, focusing on indicators such as renewable uptake, decentralization, energy efficiency demand, and CO2 prices for 2020-2040. The analysis did not influence our strategy but strongly confirmed it. The results revealed that our portfolio is resilient to climate change. In fact, the majority of our portfolio benefits from energy transformation, including Virtual Power Plants (VPP), Decentralized Energy Systems (DES), future grids, Digital Grids, and storage, even more so in the next decades."
