Premium analysis period\nIn this section, we looked at the movement of long -term interest rates with short -term interest rates and premiums for a period of time, and then looked at each movement before and after the financial crisis.\nThe methodologies used to make long -term interest rates as short -term interest rates and decomposition them into premiums are as follows.\nThe methodology of Adrian, Crump, Moenc (2008, ACM) was used to break down long-term interest rates with short-term expectations and term premiums.\nIn general, short -term interest rates are known to reflect the prospects for economic and monetary policy, and the premium is mainly uncertainty and debt supply and demand conditions.\nIn this section, we looked at whether the recent long -term interest rate sympathy is due to short -term interest rates or the result of the premium synchronization.\nPremium estimation of the US, Germany, UK, and Japanese government bonds used monthly data by 3, 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 -year Travel Travel Bonds.\nThe long -term interest rate decomposition process can be divided into three processes: \u2460 calculating the rate of overtime, calculating the risk market price, and \u2462 premium calculation by maturity.\nThe ACM model used in this paper can be estimated without the process of numerical optimization by adopting a repeated linear regression estimation method, unlike the existing Gaussian Affine period structure that estimates the parameters with the maximum likelihood Estimation.\nAs a result, the cost of calculation can be greatly reduced, which is considered to be superior in terms of estimation costs and model scalability.\nAs a result of analyzing long -term interest rates with short -term interest rates and premiums, the influence of premiums on long -term interest rates has expanded since the financial crisis.\nAccording to Figure 3, premiums during major countries after the financial crisis show a steeper fall than long -term interest rates.\nHere, long -term interest rates before major countries have been influenced by short -term expectations, and the decline in long -term interest rates after the financial crisis is mainly due to the falling premium.\nMeanwhile, the premium period presented by the Fed in New York was lower than the estimates of this paper, but the movement was similar to the estimates of this paper.The reason why the premium level is different during the estimated period seems to be due to the duration of the data used in the Federation of New York and the New York Fed.\nThe Fed's estimates are estimated by the 1961, which included the 1970s and 80s, when the short -term interest rates were very high.\nIn addition, the Fed is estimated to be used using the 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 -year -old government bond yields, unlike this paper.It is thought that it caused the difference between the Fed estimates.\nQuestion: \nHow did you share long -term interest rates with premium and short -term interest rates to know the trends before and after the financial crisis?",

The meaning and importance of the three major policy tasks\n\u25c6 Risks related to the three policy tasks have been mentioned sporadically as the main risk factors for the Chinese economy, but the Chinese government has recently established a core policy agenda by expressing its aggressive willingness to solve these tasks.\n\u25c6 The process of promoting the three policy tasks is a process that must go through the long -term and stable growth of the Chinese economy, but in the short term, the negative impact may be affected, so be careful about the ripple effect on Korea and the global economy as well as China as well as China.\n(The meaning of the three policy tasks)\n\u25a1 In October 2017, at the 19th Party Congress, President Xi Jinping emphasized the prevention of financial risks, eradicating poverty, and easing environmental pollution on the main premise of entering Xiaokan society.\n\u3147 In December 2017, at the Central Economic Meeting Conference, the three problems emphasized by President Xi Jinping are officially presented as three policy tasks.\n\u25a1 In March of this year, the National University's `` 2018 National Economy and Social Development Plan Report '' suggests one of the top ten major tasks in the economic society.\n\u3147 (Financial Risk Prevention) Efforts to resolve the leverage of local governments and companies (especially state -owned companies) and preemptively respond to system risks\n\u25aa 2018 financial policy stance includes strengthening supervision, prevention of risks, suppressing bubble, and serverjing (, \u9632 \u9669, \u6291 \u6ce1\u6cab, \u53bb)\n\u3147 (Erase poverty) Efforts to develop poverty area agricultural products, improve compulsory education, and reduce the burden of medical care in the poor population\n\u3147 (Environmental pollution easing) By 2020, aiming to significantly decrease major pollutants emissions, 'four reductions, four increases' measures will be implemented.\n(The importance of the three policy tasks)\n\u2460 Financial risk prevention\n\u25a1 Commonly reduced corporate debt can have a negative impact on economic growth in the short term, but it is evaluated as a process to be endured for long -term economic stability.\n\u3147 As China's servering policy is extensively implemented, credit supply growth is reduced, and real investment is also slowed down in infrastructure.\n\u25aa Recently, the growth rate of fixed asset investment is the lowest level ever.\n\u3147 If the credit supply to the company due to Dileabury is excessive, China's GDP growth rate will drop to mid -4%over the next five years (Fitch, June 2018)\n\u25aa When corporate investment decreases due to dionbury (5%p per year), the demand for raw materials such as crude oil and metal also decreases, which affects the global inflation and economies of neighboring countries.\nQuestion: \nWhat measures do China run to reduce environmental pollutant emissions by 2020?",
        "output": "By 2020, the Chinese government has implemented four reductions, four growth, with the goal of significantly reducing major pollutants emissions.\n\nFour reductions are as follows:\n\n-Repleted harmful gas emissions\n-Reduction of fossil energy consumption\n-Reduction of water consumption\n-Reduction of wood consumption\n\nFour increase () is as follows.\n\n-Increasing forest planting\n-Redly increased green energy consumption\n-Recytment increase\n-Increased transportation conversion\n\nThrough these measures, the Chinese government wanted to reduce air pollution, water pollution and soil pollution and improve the environment.\n\nIn order to reduce environmental pollutants, the Chinese government implemented various policies such as industrial restructuring, energy structure reform, traffic system improvement, and agricultural restructuring.\n\nBy restructuring, the Chinese government has reduced the high energy industry and high -polluted industries and fostered the service and eco -friendly industries.\n\nThrough the energy structural reform, the Chinese government reduced its dependence on fossil fuels and expanded renewable energy and nuclear power.\n\nBy improving the traffic system, the Chinese government has developed a public transportation system and reduced the use of automobiles.\n\nBy restructuring agricultural restructuring, the Chinese government reduced the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides and expanded organic agriculture.\n\nAs a result of these policies, China has succeeded in significantly reducing major pollutants by 2020.

        "output": "Choi Sung is a statistical model, and a three -stage HECKMAN selection orthodontic model was used.The correction model of the HECKMAN selection is a model used when there is a selection convenience, and it is used to correct it because the estimated coefficient may be biased when there is a selection convenience.\n\nChoi Sung -eun used the three -stage HECKMAN selection calibration model to estimate the effect of the amount of childcare support on the labor supply of married women.Choi Sung -eun affects the mock economic activities, but the variables that do not affect wages have set the number of children by age, subjective health, household income, and the difference in childcare fees for employment and unemployed.\n\nAccording to Choi's study, the greater the amount of childcare support, the less married women's labor supply decreases.This is because if the amount of childcare fee increases, married women can take care of their children without burdening childcare fees, so they are more likely to not participate in the labor market."

        "output": "The factors that the online transactions have increased quickly are as follows.\n\n* Increasing convenience of transactions due to the development of ICT technology such as mobile Internet\n* Price transparency and competition between companies\n* Diversification of online shopping malls and diversification of products\n* Development of online payment system\n* Promotion of online shopping through social media\n* Government online shopping promotion policy\n\nThese factors have increased online transactions rapidly.Therefore, the answer is to increase trading convenience due to the development of ICT technology such as mobile Internet."

If foreign investment assets drop, it can act as a capital leakage pressure by raising concerns about inseparable and falling.\nOn the other hand, the speed of aging was also significantly influenced by the size of foreign assets.\nThis suggests that aging can accelerate the depletion of external investment assets if it is now rapidly developed compared to the improvement of fundamentals in the economy.\nOn the other hand, the increase in the population of production was significantly influenced by external investment assets.\nIn other words, if income exceeds consumption, it is interpreted that external investments, which are external savings, will be active.\nThis paper was configured as follows.\nIn the next chapter, we examined previous studies on the impact of aging on international capital flow or foreign exchange sectors.\nNext, Chapter III sets a national panel model and conducted demonstration analysis to analyze the impact of aging on the size of foreign investment assets.\nIn addition, the samples were divided into emerging countries and developed countries, comparing the impact of aging on foreign investments in each group.\nLastly, Chapter IV summarized the main results of demonstration analysis and derives policy implications.\nQuestion: \nHow can you relieve endurance caused by aging?",
        "output": "To alleviate the endurance caused by aging, you can use the following methods.\n\n** ** Using the Arellano-Bond Estimation: ** Arellano-Bond estimation method is an estimated method used to alleviate the problem of endurance.This estimation method is a type of generalization method (GMM) used in quantitative economics, and was developed to solve endoscopic problems in time series data.The Arellano-Bond estimates use the past values of the variable as a tool variable to alleviate the internal generation problem.\n***Use of other endoscopic relief: ** In addition to the estimation of Arellano-Bond, the method can be used to alleviate the internal birth problem:\n    ***Use of instrument variables: ** The instrument variable is a variable that does not correlate with the error port.Using the instrument variable can distinguish the effects of endurance variables from the impact of error protests.\n    ***Panel data use: ** Panel data is data for time for individuals such as individuals and companies.Panel data can be removed by individuals, so you can relieve endurance problems.\n    ** ** Use of error correction model: ** The error modification model is a model that includes both past values and error protests on the current values of the endor's variable.The error crystal model can alleviate the internal generation problem.\n\nBy relieving the endurance caused by this aging, you can get more accurate and reliable analysis results."

        "output": "Here's how to guess the adverse effects of Korea's current resin from increasing the old age support rate.\n\n**One.Use the Secondary Function Model: ** The secondary function model that adds the square port of the old age support rate can be used to estimate the impact of the old -age support rate on the current account.This method is quite common, and it can be considered as a nonlinear impact on the elderly support rate on the current account.\n\n**2.Using Dummy Variables: ** You can create a dummy variable by setting a critical value to distinguish between the old age support rate and the case below.Afterwards, you can use this dummy variable to estimate the impact of old -age support rates on the current account.This method can take into account the possibility that the impact of the old -age support rate on the current account can change rapidly based on the threshold.\n\n** 3.Using panel data analysis: ** Panel data analysis can be analyzed to consider the country's time, which allows you to estimate the causal relationship between the old age support rate and the current account.This method controls the effects of other factors (eg economic growth, inflation rates, etc.) to estimate the pure impact of the old -age support rate on the current account.\n\n**4.Use the economic model: ** You can use an economic model that estimates the impact of old age support rate on the economy.This method can estimate the impact of old -age support rates on current accounts, considering the impact of old -age support rates on various factors in the economy, such as savings, investments, and labor markets.\n\nThe estimated results using these methods predict that the effect of the old-age support rate on the current account will be negative.In other words, as the elderly support rate increases, the current account is expected to worsen.However, the accuracy of the estimated results may vary depending on the data, model, estimation method, etc. used.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer can also be predicted that the rapid increase in the old -age support rate will have a negative effect on the current account of the old age by using the estimated value of the 0.15 threshold in the estimation using the dummy variable."

Sounds that there is a significant difference in the response of financial variables (asset prices, capital outputs) other than exchange rates.This is because the economic structure and financial system of overseas countries are different.For example, countries with the development of financial systems can be more sensitive to changes in US monetary policy than countries where financial systems have not developed.\n\nTherefore, DEDOLA et al.

        "output": "The German government is delivering venture capital in the following way to fast -growing companies.\n\n1. ** Cooperation with European Investment Bank **: Cooperate with European Investment Bank to support venture capital to fast -growing companies.The European Investment Bank is a bank established to support the economic development of the European Union (EU) members, providing loans and guarantees for companies and projects.\n\n2. ** Utilization of the Passage of the German Reconstruction Bank (KFW) **: We use the passage of the German reconstruction Bank (KFW) to support venture capital to fast -growing companies.KFW is a national bank in Germany, providing loans and guarantees for SMEs and infrastructure projects.\n\n3. ** Establishment of Investment Assistance Program for Venture Capital **: Investment assistance program for venture capital is established to support venture capital to fast -growing companies.The program aims to activate venture capital investment by providing subsidies for investment to venture capital investors.\n\n4. ** Establishment of brokerage for venture companies to promote the public disclosure **: In order to promote the public disclosure of venture companies, a brokerage agency connects investors and venture entrepreneurs.The brokerage is supported by venture entrepreneurs to meet investors and attract investments.\n\nIn this way, the German government supports the growth of the company by delivering venture capital to fast -growing companies. Therefore, the answer is not only cooperates with the European investment bank, but also uses the passage of the German reconstruction bank (KFW) to fast growthIt is supporting venture capital to companies."

        "input": "12. Payment preparation system\nThe payment preparation system refers to a system that requires deposit handling agencies to deposit the amount corresponding to a certain percentage of debt, including deposits.Originally, the system was introduced to maintain financial soundness by allowing banks to respond to debt payment demands in the US in the United States, but it could affect the amount of money by changing the payment rate in the 1930s by changing the payment rate in the 1930s.Recognizing, it began to be used as a major liquidity control means.\nUntil the 1970s, the payment preparation system was actively used as a useful monetary policy to control the amount of money in each country, but for various reasons, the use of major developed countries has gradually decreased since the 1980s.As such, the utilization as a means of monetary policy has been lowered, but some emerging economies, mainly in South America, are still useful as a means of macroscopic or monetary policy.\nEmerging countries that use the payment preparation system as a means of macroscopic policies are mainly used for the purpose of improving the Credit Cycle and \u2461 the bank's funding structure.This is because the system can ease the amplitude of the credit supply by operating the system in response to the economy.In other words, if the financial circulation is expanded when the expansion is expanded, the loan interest rate rises to suppress the increase in credit (Figure 3-5), which can prevent the accumulation of financial imbalances.By doing it, it is possible to use the reserves that were accumulated in the expansion phase to make the liquidity shock.\nThe policy rate adjustment can ease the credit circulation by managing the surplus rate, but the payment preparation system can be applied to certain sectors.In addition, in the small -scale open economy, if the credit expansion is expanded due to overseas factors (such as current account surplus or inflow of foreign securities investment funds), side effects may occur (additional foreign capital inflows and the appreciation of monetary) can occur if the credit expansion is expanded due to the expansion of credit surpluses (etc.)Another advantage is that there is no concern about these side effects when raising the preparation rate.\nQuestion: \nWhat do emergencies about the payment preparation system for emerging economies buffer?",

Introduction to Bail-in\nIn order to prevent the loss of the financial institution's bankruptcy, the loss of the bankruptcy of financial institutions is taken by the bankruptcy of the financial institutions, and the debate on the loss burden (Bail-in) is discussed to prevent the loss of losses due to the bankruptcy of financial institutions.there is.\nThe principle of loss burden is to minimize the bailout support that leads to taxpayers' burden by paying the cost of the taxpayer's burden by paying the cost of the taxpayer by paying the cost of the insolvent financial institution through the debt-down and the conversion conversion.Can.\nThe principle of loss burden is divided into a forced loss burden (Statutory or Mandatory Bail-in), which is legally forced to be legally forced by the decision of the Contractual Contingment Capital (COCO) and the decision of the organization.At the time of the financial institution's arrangement, the first conditional capital absorbs the loss and absorbs the loss through the conversion of bonds and investment in accordance with the principle of forced loss of forced loss.\nConditional capital refers to a bond of capital personality that has been converted to or automatically amazed at trigger events in accordance with a private contract between financial institutions and creditors.It can be issued in various forms such as charts.\nForced loss burden refers to the fact that financial bonds are amortized or shifted by legal forced to determine the arrangement of the organizing authorities under the special theorem.In order for the forced loss burden to proceed efficiently, the authority, implementation requirements, and procedures should be clearly defined in the relevant laws.There is also a device to prevent the decision of a discretionary burden of discretionary for the averaging authority from becoming a trigger point of the infectious effect.(For more details, see \u201cMandatory Bail-in\u201d)\n6. Improvement of timely corrective measures\nWith the global financial crisis, the problem and the need for improvement were highlighted in the United States.The U.S. Governement AccountableOffice (U.S. GAO) evaluated that it was inefficient to determine the time of SRR initiation based on the fact that the ratio of equity capital was less than a certain level (2%) in the timely municipal measures.This is because the ratio of equity has a trailable trend that worsens the most later than other soundness indicators, so it is not appropriate for the start of a preemptive and rapid arrangement.\nTherefore, in addition to the equity ratio, it was argued that Earlywarning Indicator, such as credit bias, liquidity, and asset quality, to be used for financial institutions' insolvency.\nIn addition, even if the supervisory authorities find a problem bank, the \u201cforbearance\u201d, which does not apply the regulation strictly, has been raised as a problem.More than 80% of the banks who went bankrupt during the global financial crisis were in the watch list of the supervisory authorities for more than one year, but the timely corrective measures were loosely executed, resulting in an increase in bailout costs due to bankruptcy of financial institutions.In order to solve the problem of loose regulations, GAO recommended a rulebase that developed insolvent indicators that could be easily and clearly understood by financial market participants and used it as a requirement for timely corrective measures.\nQuestion: \nWhat did you do to prevent damages from being able to resolve it in social costs if damages occur due to bankruptcy of financial institutions?",
        "output": "If damages occur due to bankruptcy of financial institutions, we have introduced the Bail-in principle to prevent them from solving them at social costs.\n\nThe principle of loss burden is that creditors and shareholders who are insider of financial institutions are burdened with the cost of organizing insolvent financial institutions through writing-down and conversion.This minimizes bailout support that leads to the burden of taxpayers.\n\nThe principle of loss burden is divided into a termination or mandatory Bail-in, which is legally forced by the decision of the Contractual Contingment Capital (COCO) and the decision of the organization.At the time of the financial institution's arrangement, the first conditional capital absorbs the loss and absorbs the loss through the conversion of bonds and investment in accordance with the principle of forced loss of forced loss.\n\n Therefore, the answer is to discuss the Bail-in principle of loss."

        "output": "Since 2015, Korea has taken the following measures to promote the Fraun Hopper -type business.\n\n1. Six organizations were selected as industrial technology -oriented research institutes to carry out a separate Fraunhopper project.\n\nThese six institutions are as follows:\n\n* Production Technology Research Institute\n* Korea Automobile Research Institute\n* Electronics Research Institute\n* Information and Communication Industry Promotion Agency\n* Ulsan Institute of Science and Technology\n* POSTECH\n\n2. Increasing the amount of private entrustment by matching the ratio of private trusts to 37%, and the increase in the amount of contributions, and the amount of contributions is reduced.\n\nThrough these measures, South Korea intended to strengthen cooperation with the industry and promote the development of industrial technology by promoting the Fraun Hopper -type business.Tose, the answer is that six institutions are selected as an industrial technology -oriented research institute,In the case of the increase in private trusts by matching the ratio of private entrustment to 37%, the amount of contributions increased, and the amount of contributions was reduced when the private trust amount decreased."

Improvement of regulations to strengthen competitiveness by financial sector\nLegislation to enhance competitiveness also continued by each financial sector.It was intended to improve the bank's competitiveness by improving regulations on banks.When calculating the BIS capital ratio, the current criteria for excluding large -hand reserves from the common stock capital were rationalized to avoid deducting large -handed reserves in the common stock capital.Through this, it was to ease the expansion of domestic banks and create an equal competitive environment with foreign banks (enforcement of the \u201cBanking Supervisory Regulations\u201d, 2016.12.14).At the same time, the bank's financing autonomy was expanded by raising the bank bond issuance limit from three to five times the capital.In addition, the company's investment limit for subsidiaries of subsidiaries was raised from 15%to 20%so that banks could flexibly respond to future investments such as expanding overseas expansion.The regulations related to the bank's real estate management were also reduced to abolish the regulations on the real estate rental area and to be leased until the date of disposal of non -business dances (Enforcement Decree of the Banking Act 2016.6.30, 2016.7.30).\nQuestion: \nWhat did the financial industry for the flexible response to the bank's demand for investment?",

        "input": "1. The aging of the population structure\nAs it is already well known, Korea is facing an unprecedented rapid aging aging worldwide.In general, if the proportion of population aged 65 or older is 7% or more, it is classified as an aging society, an aging society if it is 14% or more, and a super-aged society if it is 20% or more.Korea has already entered the aging society in 2000, and the aging society is expected to enter in 2019 and in the ultra -aging society in 2026.In other words, our society is still in the early stages of aging, but is rapidly racing into an aging society.This change of demographic structure acts as a serious increase in social insurance expenditures and burden by increasing the elderly population and decreasing the productive population.\nFirst of all, the increase in the population of the elderly due to the aging population has a direct impact on the demand for social insurance.As shown in Table 3-1, the share of population over 65 years of age is expected to increase by five times from 7.2%in 2000 to 34.4%in 2050.This rapid elderly population will greatly increase the demand for salary expenditures for various public pensions, including national pensions.In addition, continuous increase in elderly medical expenses will increase the pressure to increase the expenditure of health insurance.Demand for public pensions and health insurance due to the aging population will cause a corresponding premium burden if other conditions are constant.Moreover, in Korea, the rapid progress of aging will rise rapidly.\nIn addition, population aging will increase the burden of social insurance by reducing the decrease in the productive population.As shown in Table 3-1, the Korean population (aged 15-64) is expected to begin to decrease in earnest in 2020.As a result, the population of production in 2050 will decrease by 27.6%compared to 2000.In other words, the labor supply will increase in the next 15 to 20 years due to the increase in the population of the product and the increase in women's participation in economic activities.In this case, the decrease in the production population will inevitably lead to an increase in premiums per worker to cover the same social insurance spending.\nQuestion: \nIf the production population decreases, how do you meet social insurance spending?",
        "output": "If the production population is reduced, there is a method to meet social insurance spending:\n\n1. ** Increase in premiums: ** If the production population decreases, you must raise the premium per worker to cover the same social insurance expenditure.However, raising insurance premiums can increase the burden of workers and companies and slow economic growth.\n\n2. ** Extension of pension age: ** As the elderly population increases, the pension age is extended to shorten the pension payment period and reduce the number of pensioners.However, the extension of the age of pension payments can make the old man's retirement life difficult.\n\n3. ** Restrictions on qualifications for supply and demand: ** As the elderly population increases, it can reduce the number of pension payments by limiting the eligibility of public pensions.However, limiting the qualification of public pensions can add economic difficulties for the elderly.\n\n4. ** Public pension level reduction: ** As the elderly population increases, it can reduce pension spending by reducing the level of public pensions.However, reducing the level of public pension payments can increase the economic difficulties of the elderly.\n\n5. ** Productivity improvement: ** Even if the production population decreases, it can improve productivity and cover social insurance expenses.In order to improve productivity, policies such as technology innovation, education investment, and labor market flexibility are required.\n\nIf the production population decreases, there are many ways to meet social insurance spending, but all of these methods have advantages and disadvantages.Therefore, the government should consider various factors such as economic growth, the welfare of the elderly, and the burden of workers when determining how to meet social insurance spending.Therefore, the correct answer is an increase in premiums per worker."

African model: From resource exports to renewable energy industry\ngo.North Korea's underground resources and power status\nIn the scenario where the investment in South Korea is expanded, including the integration of the two Koreas to build infrastructure in North Korea, in the scenario, it is pursued by investing in the next -generation growth industry in addition to the fuzzy -style labor -intensive export industry model and India's IT service -led growth model.You can consider a model that achieves growth.Indeed, some countries in South America and Africa invest the funds from exporting rich mineral resources in the renewable energy industry and create new growth engines (Lee, 2013, Ch. 9).\nNorth Korea is also known to be rich in reserves of underground resources, which is estimated to be around $ 6 trillion, which is five times that of South Korean GDP.In particular, South Korea's self -sufficiency is very low, and when developed, there is a rich buried light species.Therefore, if mineral resources are developed in earnest, exports are expected to expand significantly.\nHowever, despite the abundance of reserves of mineral resources, there are no industrial complexes that are processed in North Korea, so minerals such as anthracite coal are exported without additional processing.The largest exporter is China, and exports to the late 2000s are increasing significantly, and the exports of anthracite coal, which were only $ 1.6 billion in 2007, surged to about $ 13.7 billion in 2013.Exports of this type are also found in African countries such as Mozambique. In order to create added value and industrial ripple effects, it is necessary to change the export of the same type and at least process it.To this end, it is necessary to create an industrial complex for mining processing, and the foundation for transportation and power infrastructure must be established, so South Korea's investment and technical cooperation are inevitable.\nIf so, the key is to use the funds obtained by the export of underground resources in North Korea.First of all, North Korea's power facilities, which were built in the 1950s and 60s, were replaced by a high -tech smart grid method to resolve North Korea's power shortages, while considering the strategy of developing the technology of this field and leaping as a starter.can see.In this chapter, we will first examine the current status of North Korea and review the possibility of applying the North Korean region of the Northeast Asia Super Grid and the Northeast Asian Super Grid.\nQuestion: \nHow do you handle mineral resources like anthracite to promote added value and ripple effects?",
        "output": "To enhance the added value and ripple effects, you need to switch to at least primary processing mineral resources such as anthracite.This requires an industrial complex for mining processing, and a transportation and power infrastructure base must be established.In addition, South Korea's investment and technical cooperation are inevitable.\n\nThe following is a specific way to enhance the added value and ripple effect.\n\n1. ** Industrial complex for mining processing **: Processes before exporting mineral resources to increase added value.To do this, you need to create an industrial complex for mining processing.Industrial complexes are located in factories, research institutes, and educational institutions that process mineral resources.\n\n2. ** Provision of transportation and power infrastructure **: Transportation and power infrastructure base is essential for processing and exporting mineral resources.If the transportation infrastructure is well equipped, the mineral resources can be carried smoothly as a processing plant, and if the power infrastructure is well equipped, it can be produced smoothly in the processing factory.\n\n3. ** South Korea's investment and technical cooperation **: Investment and technology needed to process and export mineral resources can be supported by South Korea.This is because South Korea has many experiences and skills in the field of mineral resources.\n\nIn this way, mineral resources can be processed and exported to enhance the added value and ripple effect.If added value is promoted, the economy grows, and when the ripple effect is promoted, jobs are created.Therefore, the correct answer is to switch to the method of avoiding exports and at least processed and exported."
