product lines . sysco 2019s operating companies purchase product from the suppliers participating in these consolidated programs and from other suppliers , although sysco brand products are only available to the operating companies through these consolidated programs . we also focus on increasing profi tability by lowering operating costs and by lowering aggregate inventory levels , which reduces future facility expansion needs at our broadline operating companies , while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers . this includes the construction and operation of regional distribution centers ( rdcs ) , which aggregate inventory demand to optimize the supply chain activities for certain products for all sysco broadline operating companies in the region . currently , we

. we generally maintain inventory on hand to be able to meet customer demand . the level of inventory on hand will vary by product depending on shelf-life , supplier order fulfi llment lead times and customer demand . we also make purchases of additional volumes of certain products based on supply or pricing opportunities . we take advantage of suppliers 2019 cash discounts where appropriate and

however , the company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates . the company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments . because the company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes , there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components . the company's operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the company's ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns . gross margin declined to 23% ( 23 % ) of net sales in 2001 from 27% ( 27 % ) in 2000 . this decline resulted primarily from gross margin of negative 2% ( 2 % ) experienced during the first quarter of 2001 compared to 26% ( 26 % ) gross margin for the same quarter in 2000 . in addition to lower than normal net .\n||2002|2001|2000|\n|net sales|$ 5742|$ 5363|$ 7983|\n|cost of sales|4139|4128|5817|\n|gross margin|$ 1603|$ 1235|$ 2166|\n|gross margin percentage|28% ( 28 % )|23% ( 23 % )|27% ( 27 % )|\n.\nQuestion: what was the percentage change in net sales from 2001 to 2002?\nAnswer:",

predominantly for market-making activities . derivatives enable counterparties to manage exposures to fluctuations in interest rates , currencies and other markets . the firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit and other market risk exposure . the nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the firm is exposed . for otc derivatives the firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty . for exchange- traded derivatives ( 201cetd 201d ) , such as futures and options , and 201ccleared 201d over-the-counter ( 201cotc-cleared 201d ) derivatives , the firm is generally exposed to the credit risk of the relevant ccp . where possible , the firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative transactions through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements . for further discussion of derivative contracts , counterparties and settlement types , see note 5 . the following table summarizes the net derivative receivables for the periods presented . derivative receivables .\n|december 31 ( in millions )|2017|2016|\n|interest

instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained . derivative receivables reported on the consolidated balance sheets were $ 56.5 billion and $ 64.1 billion at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively . derivative receivables decreased predominantly as a result of client- driven market-making activities in cib markets , which reduced foreign exchange and interest rate derivative receivables , and increased equity derivative receivables , driven by market movements . derivative receivables amounts represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the firm . however , in management 2019s view , the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities ( primarily u.s . government and agency securities and other group of seven nations ( 201cg7 201d ) government bonds ) and other cash collateral held by the firm aggregating $ 16.1 billion and $ 22.7 billion at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively , that may be used as security when the fair value of the client 2019s exposure is in the firm 2019s favor . in addition to the collateral described in the preceding paragraph , the firm also holds additional collateral ( primarily cash , g7 government securities , other liquid government-agency and guaranteed securities , and corporate debt and equity securities ) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions , as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date . although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above , it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client 2019s derivative transactions move in the firm 2019s favor . the derivative receivables fair value , net of all collateral , also does not include other credit enhancements , such as letters of credit . for additional information on the firm 2019s use of collateral agreements , see note 5 . while useful as a current view of credit exposure , the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure . to capture the potential future variability of credit exposure , the firm calculates , on a client-by-client basis , three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss : peak , derivative risk equivalent ( 201cdre 201d ) , and average exposure ( 201cavg 201d ) . these measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits , where applicable . peak represents a conservative measure of potential exposure to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% ( 97.5 % ) confidence level over the life of the transaction . peak is the primary measure used by the firm for setting of credit limits for derivative transactions , senior management reporting and derivatives exposure management . dre exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures . dre is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than peak and is used for aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and other credit risk . finally , avg is a measure of the expected fair value of the firm 2019s derivative receivables at future time periods , including the benefit of collateral . avg exposure over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital and the cva , as further described below . the three year avg exposure was $ 29.0 billion and $ 31.1 billion at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively , compared with derivative receivables , net of all collateral , of $ 40.4 billion and $ 41.4 billion at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively . the fair value of the firm 2019s derivative receivables incorporates cva to reflect the credit quality of counterparties . cva is based on the firm 2019s avg to a counterparty and the counterparty 2019s credit spread in the credit derivatives market . the firm believes that active risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio . in addition , the firm 2019s risk management process takes into consideration the potential .\nQuestion: credit derivatives for 2017 were what percent of the

cost of revenues increased by $ 8.718 billion in 2003 from 2002 and $ 367 million in 2002 from 2001 . the increases in the oerb segment were primarily a result of higher natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon costs . the increases in the rm&t segment primarily reflected higher acquisition costs for crude oil , refined products , refinery charge and blend feedstocks and increased manufacturing expenses . selling , general and administrative expenses increased by $ 107 million in 2003 from 2002 and $ 125 million in 2002 from 2001 . the increase in 2003 was primarily a result of increased

, accordingly , the company did not perform the second step of the impairment test , except for the test performed as of december 31 , 2008 . as of december 31 , 2008 , there was an indication of impairment in the north america consumer banking , latin america consumer banking and emea consumer banking reporting units and , accordingly , the second step of testing was performed on these reporting units . based on the results of the second step of testing , the company recorded a $ 9.6 billion pretax ( $ 8.7 billion after tax ) goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2008 , representing the entire amount of goodwill allocated to these reporting units . the primary cause for the goodwill impairment in the above reporting units was the rapid deterioration in the financial markets , as well as in the global economic outlook particularly during the period beginning mid-november through year end 2008 . this deterioration further weakened the near-term prospects for the financial services industry . these and other factors , including the increased possibility of further government intervention , also resulted in the decline in the company 2019s market capitalization from approximately $ 90 billion at july 1 , 2008 and approximately $ 74 billion at october 31 , 2008 to approximately $ 36 billion at december 31 , 2008 . the more significant fair-value adjustments in the pro forma purchase price allocation in the second step of testing were to fair-value loans and debt and were made to identify and value identifiable intangibles . the adjustments to measure the assets , liabilities and intangibles were for the purpose of measuring the implied fair value of goodwill and such adjustments are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet . the following table shows reporting units with goodwill balances and the excess of fair value of allocated book value as of december 31 , 2008 . reporting unit ( $ in millions ) fair value as a % (  % ) of allocated book value goodwill ( post-impairment ) .\n|reporting unit ( $ inmillions )|fair value as a % (  % ) of allocated book value|goodwill ( post-impairment )|\n|north america

october 31 , 2008 and december 31 , 2008 , goodwill present in that reporting unit may be particularly sensitive to further deterioration in economic conditions . under the market approach for valuing this reporting unit , the earnings multiples and transaction multiples were selected from multiples obtained using data from guideline companies and acquisitions . the selection of the actual multiple considers operating performance and financial condition such as return on equity and net income growth of securities and banking as compared to the guideline companies and acquisitions . for the valuation under the income approach , the company utilized a discount rate which it believes reflects the risk and uncertainty related to the projected cash flows , and selected 2013 as the terminal year . in 2013 , the value was derived assuming a return to historical levels of core-business profitability for the reporting unit , despite the significant losses experienced in 2008 . this assumption is based on management 2019s view that this recovery will occur based upon various macro- economic factors such as the recent u.s . government stimulus actions , restoring marketplace confidence and improved risk-management practices on an industry-wide basis . furthermore , company-specific actions such as its recently announced realignment of its businesses to optimize its global businesses for future profitable growth , will also be a factor in returning the company 2019s core securities and banking business to historical levels . small deterioration in the assumptions used in the valuations , in particular the discount rate and growth rate assumptions used in the net income projections , could significantly affect the company 2019s impairment evaluation and , hence , results . if the future were to differ adversely from management 2019s best estimate of key economic assumptions and associated cash flows were to decrease by a small margin , the company could potentially experience future material impairment charges with respect to the goodwill remaining in our securities and banking reporting unit . any such charges by themselves would not negatively affect the company 2019s tier 1 and total regulatory capital ratios , tangible capital or the company 2019s liquidity position. .\nQuestion: in 2008 what was the tax rate associated with the goodwill

resale agreements , repurchase agreements , securities borrowed transactions and securities loaned transactions primarily to finance the firm 2019s inventory positions , acquire securities to cover short positions and settle other securities obligations . the firm also enters into these transactions to accommodate customers 2019 needs . securities purchased under resale agreements ( 201cresale agreements 201d ) and securities sold under repurchase agreements ( 201crepurchase agreements 201d ) are generally treated as collateralized financing transactions and are carried on the consolidated bal- ance sheet at the amounts the securities will be subsequently sold or repurchased , plus accrued interest . where appropriate , resale and repurchase agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis in accordance with fin 41 . jpmorgan chase takes possession of securities purchased under resale agreements . on a daily basis , jpmorgan chase monitors the market value of the underlying collateral received from its counterparties , consisting primarily of u.s . and non-u.s . govern- ment and agency securities , and requests additional collateral from its counterparties when necessary . similar transactions that do not meet the sfas 140 definition of a repurchase agreement are accounted for as 201cbuys 201d and 201csells 201d rather than financing transactions . these transactions are accounted for as a purchase ( sale ) of the underlying securities with a forward obligation to sell ( purchase ) the securities . the forward purchase ( sale ) obligation , a derivative , is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at its fair value , with changes in fair value recorded in trading revenue . notional amounts of these transactions accounted for as purchases under sfas 140 were $ 15 billion and $ 8 billion at december 31 , 2003 and 2002 , respectively . notional amounts of these transactions accounted for as sales under sfas 140 were $ 8 billion

securities as col- lateral that can be repledged , delivered or otherwise used with a fair value of approximately $ 210 billion . this collateral was gen- erally obtained under resale or securities-borrowing agreements . of these securities , approximately $ 197 billion was repledged , delivered or otherwise used , generally as collateral under repur- chase agreements , securities-lending agreements or to cover short sales . notes to consolidated financial statements j.p . morgan chase & co . loans are reported at the principal amount outstanding , net of the allowance for loan losses , unearned income and any net deferred loan fees . loans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value . loans are classified as 201ctrading 201d for secondary market trading activities where positions are bought and sold to make profits from short-term movements in price . loans held for trading purposes are included in trading assets and are carried at fair value , with the gains and losses included in trading revenue . interest income is recognized using the interest method , or on a basis approximating a level rate of return over the term of the loan . nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest is discontinued . loans ( other than certain consumer loans discussed below ) are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if , in the opinion of management , full payment of principal or interest is in doubt , or when principal or interest is 90 days or more past due and collateral , if any , is insufficient to cover prin- cipal and interest . interest accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed against interest income . in addition , the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended . interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized only to the extent it is received in cash . however , where there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of loan principal , all cash thereafter received is applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan . loans are restored to accrual status only when interest and principal payments are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured . consumer loans are generally charged to the allowance for loan losses upon reaching specified stages of delinquency , in accor- dance with the federal financial institutions examination council ( 201cffiec 201d ) policy . for example , credit card loans are charged off at the earlier of 180 days past due or within 60 days from receiving notification of the filing of bankruptcy . residential mortgage products are generally charged off to net realizable value at 180 days past due . other consumer products are gener- ally charged off ( to net realizable value if collateralized ) at 120 days past due . accrued interest on residential mortgage products , automobile financings and certain other consumer loans are accounted for in accordance

varying ownership structures . substantially all of our joint venture arrangements are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as we have the ability to exercise significant influence , but not control over the operating and financial decisions of these joint venture arrange- ments . our off-balance-sheet arrangements are discussed in note a0 5 , 201cdebt and preferred equity investments 201d and note a0 6 , 201cinvestments in unconsolidated joint ventures 201d in the accompanying consolidated finan- cial statements . additional information about the debt of our unconsoli- dated joint ventures is included in 201ccontractual obligations 201d below . capital expenditures we estimate that , for the year ending december a031 , 2011 , we will incur approximately $ 120.5 a0 million of capital expenditures , which are net of loan reserves ( including tenant improvements and leasing commis- sions ) , on existing wholly-owned properties , and that our share of capital expenditures at our joint venture properties , net of loan reserves , will be approximately $ 23.4 a0million . we expect to fund these capital expen- ditures with operating cash flow , additional property level mortgage financings and cash on hand . future property acquisitions may require substantial capital investments for refurbishment and leasing costs . we expect that these financing requirements will be met in a similar fashion . we believe that we will have sufficient resources to satisfy our capital needs during the next 12-month period . thereafter , we expect our capital needs will be met through a combination of cash on hand , net cash provided by operations , borrowings , potential asset sales or addi- tional equity or debt issuances . above provides that , except to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes , we will not during any four consecu- tive fiscal quarters make distributions with respect to common stock or other equity interests in an aggregate amount in excess of 95% ( 95 % ) of funds from operations for such period , subject to certain other adjustments . as of december a0 31 , 2010 and 2009 , we were in compliance with all such covenants . market rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our floating rate borrowing arrangements . we use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes . a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate curve for 2010 and 2009 , would increase our annual interest cost by approximately $ 11.0 a0mil- lion and $ 15.2 a0million and would increase our share of joint venture annual interest cost by approximately $ 6.7 a0million and $ 6.4 a0million , respectively . we recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value . derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income . if a derivative is a hedge , depending on the nature of the hedge , changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset , liability , or firm commitment through earnings , or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings . the ineffective portion of a deriva- tive 2019s change in fair value is recognized immediately in earnings . approximately $ 4.1 a0billion of our long-term debt bore interest at fixed rates , and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in the market interest rates . the interest rate on our variable rate debt and joint venture debt as of december a031 , 2010 ranged from libor plus 75 basis points to libor plus 400 basis points . contractual obligations combined aggregate principal

successfully executed this strategy in fiscal 2018 in a rapidly changing cost and price environment . net sales of $ 16285.1 million for fiscal 2018 increased $ 1425.4 million , or 9.6% ( 9.6 % ) , compared to fiscal 2017 . the increase was primarily a result of an increase in corrugated packaging segment sales , driven by higher selling price/mix and the contributions from acquisitions , and increased consumer packaging segment sales , primarily due to the contribution from acquisitions ( primarily the mps acquisition ) . these increases were partially offset by the absence of net sales from hh&b in fiscal 2018 due to the sale of hh&b in april 2017 and lower land and development segment sales compared to the prior year period due to the timing of real estate sales as we monetize the portfolio and lower merchandising display sales in the consumer packaging segment . segment income increased $ 491.5 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 , primarily due to increased corrugated packaging segment income . with respect to segment income , we experienced higher levels of cost inflation during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 , which was partially offset by recycled fiber deflation . the primary inflationary items were freight costs , chemical costs , virgin fiber costs and wage and other costs . productivity improvements in fiscal 2018 more than offset the net impact of cost inflation . while it is difficult to predict specific inflationary items , we expect higher cost inflation to continue through fiscal 2019 . our corrugated packaging segment increased its net sales by $ 695.1 million in fiscal 2018 to $ 9103.4 million from $ 8408.3 million in fiscal 2017 . the increase in net sales was primarily due to higher corrugated selling price/mix and higher corrugated volumes ( including acquisitions ) , which were partially offset by lower net sales from recycling operations due to lower recycled fiber costs , lower sales related to the deconsolidation of a foreign joint venture in fiscal 2017 and the impact of foreign currency . north american box shipments increased 4.1% ( 4.1 % ) on a per day basis in fiscal 2018 compared to

from strong gains in pricing and sales volumes and lower operating costs . our average paper and packaging prices in 2006 increased faster than our costs for the first time in four years . the improve- ment in sales volumes reflects increased uncoated papers , corrugated box , coated paperboard and european papers shipments , as well as improved revenues from our xpedx distribution business . our manufacturing operations also made solid cost reduction improvements . lower interest expense , reflecting debt repayments in 2005 and 2006 , was also a positive factor . together , these improvements more than offset the effects of continued high raw material and distribution costs , lower real estate sales , higher net corporate expenses and lower con- tributions from businesses and forestlands divested during 2006 . looking forward to 2007 , we expect seasonally higher sales volumes in the first quarter . average paper price realizations should continue to improve as we implement previously announced price increases in europe and brazil . input costs for energy , fiber and chemicals are expected to be mixed , although slightly higher in the first quarter . operating results will benefit from the recently completed international paper/sun paperboard joint ventures in china and the addition of the luiz anto- nio paper mill to our operations in brazil . however , primarily as a result of lower real estate sales in the first quarter , we anticipate earnings from continuing operations will be somewhat lower than in the 2006 fourth quarter . significant steps were also taken in 2006 in the execution of the company 2019s transformation plan . we completed the sales of our u.s . and brazilian coated papers businesses and 5.6 million acres of u.s . forestlands , and announced definitive sale agreements for our kraft papers , beverage pack- aging and arizona chemical businesses and a majority of our wood products business , all expected to close

shareholders by repurchasing 39.7 million shares of our common stock for approximately $ 1.4 billion . we made a $ 1.0 billion voluntary contribution to our u.s . qualified pension fund . we have

instruments to manage its own credit and other market risk exposure . the nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the firm is exposed

over-the-counter ( 201cotc-cleared 201d ) derivatives , the firm is generally exposed to the credit risk of the relevant ccp . where possible , the firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative transactions through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements . for further discussion of derivative contracts , counterparties and

instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained . derivative receivables reported on the consolidated balance sheets were $ 56.5 billion and $ 64.1 billion at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively . derivative receivables decreased predominantly as a result of client- driven market-making activities in cib markets , which reduced foreign exchange and interest rate derivative receivables , and increased equity derivative receivables , driven by market movements . derivative receivables amounts represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the firm . however , in management 2019s view , the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities ( primarily u.s . government and agency securities and other group of seven nations ( 201cg7 201d ) government bonds ) and other cash collateral held by the firm aggregating $ 16.1 billion and $ 22.7 billion at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively , that may be used as security when the fair value of the client 2019s exposure is in the firm 2019s favor . in addition to the collateral described in the preceding paragraph , the firm also holds additional collateral ( primarily cash , g7 government securities , other liquid government-agency and guaranteed securities , and corporate debt and equity securities ) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions , as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date . although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above , it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client 2019s derivative transactions move in the firm 2019s favor . the derivative receivables fair value , net of all collateral , also does not include other credit enhancements , such as letters of credit . for additional information on the firm 2019s use of collateral agreements , see note 5 . while useful as a current view of credit exposure , the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure . to capture the potential future variability of credit exposure , the firm calculates , on a client-by-client basis , three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss : peak , derivative risk equivalent ( 201cdre 201d ) , and average exposure ( 201cavg 201d ) . these measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits , where applicable . peak represents a conservative measure of potential exposure to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% ( 97.5 % ) confidence level over the life of the transaction . peak is the primary measure used by the firm for setting of credit limits for derivative transactions , senior management reporting and derivatives exposure management . dre exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures . dre is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than peak and is used for aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and other credit risk . finally , avg is a measure of the expected fair value of the firm 2019s derivative receivables at future time periods , including the benefit of collateral . avg exposure over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital and the cva , as further described below . the three year avg exposure was $ 29.0 billion and $ 31.1 billion at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively , compared with derivative receivables , net of all collateral , of $ 40.4 billion and $ 41.4 billion at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively . the fair value of the firm 2019s derivative receivables incorporates cva to reflect the credit quality of counterparties . cva is based on the firm 2019s avg to a counterparty and the counterparty 2019s credit spread in the credit derivatives market . the firm believes that active risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio . in addition , the firm 2019s risk management process takes into consideration the potential .\nQuestion: what was the percent of avg exposure on the 2017

a domestic contributory defined contribution plan ; international pension plans , which vary by country , consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans ; deferred compensation arrangements ; and certain other post- retirement benefit plans . the amounts needed to fund future payouts under our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables . cer- tain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate , expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels . we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and select assumptions that we believe reflect the economics underlying our pension and post-retirement obligations . while we believe these assumptions are within accepted industry ranges , an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings . the discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds . for fiscal 2013 , we used a discount rate for our domestic plans of 3.90% ( 3.90 % ) and vary- ing rates on our international plans of between 1.00% ( 1.00 % ) and 7.00% ( 7.00 % ) . the discount rate for our domestic plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an aa rating , or equivalent , from a major rating agency . as of june 30 , 2013 , we used an above-mean yield curve , rather than the broad-based yield curve we used before , because we believe it represents a better estimate of an effective settlement rate of the obligation , and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our domestic plans . the benefit obligation of our domestic plans would have been higher by approximately $ 34 mil- lion at june 30 , 2013 had we not used the above-mean yield curve . for our international plans , the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each country , with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan . for fiscal 2013 , we used an expected return on plan assets of 7.50% ( 7.50 % ) for our u.s . qualified plan and varying rates of between 2.25% ( 2.25 % ) and 7.00% ( 7.00 % ) for our international plans . in determining the long-term rate of return for a plan , we consider the historical rates of return , the nature of the plan 2019s investments and an expectation for the plan 2019s investment strategies . see 201cnote 12 2014 pension , deferred compensation and post-retirement benefit plans 201d of notes to consolidated financial statements for details regarding the nature of our pension and post-retirement plan invest- ments . the difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accu- mulated other comprehensive income . those gains/losses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods . for fiscal 2013 , our pension plans had actual return on assets of approximately $ 74 million as compared with expected return on assets of approximately $ 64 million . the resulting net deferred gain of approximately $ 10 million , when combined with gains and losses from previous years , will be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 7 to 22 years . the actual return on plan assets from our international pen- sion plans exceeded expectations , primarily reflecting a strong performance from fixed income and equity invest- ments . the lower than expected return on assets from our u.s . qualified plan was primarily due to weakness in our fixed income investments , partially offset by our strong equity returns . a 25 basis-point change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2013 pension expense : 25 basis-point 25 basis-point increase decrease ( in millions ) .\n|( in millions )|25 basis-point increase|25 basis-point decrease|\n|discount rate|$ -3.5 ( 3.5 )|$ 3.9|\n|expected return on assets|$ -2.5 ( 2.5 )|$ 2.7|\nour post-retirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates , which may have a significant effect on the amounts the est{e lauder companies inc . 115 .\nQuestion: what is the average rate for the international plans?\nAnswer:",

imposes a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries . the estimated impact of tax legislation was an increase in income tax expense of $ 4.40 billion , of which $ 3.32 billion was due to the repatriation tax and $ 1.08 billion was due to the effects of the implementation of the territorial tax system and the remeasurement of u.s . deferred tax assets at lower enacted corporate tax rates . the impact of tax legislation may differ from this estimate , possibly materially , due to , among other things , ( i ) refinement of our calculations based on updated information , ( ii ) changes in interpretations and assumptions , ( iii ) guidance that may be issued and ( iv ) actions we may take as a result of tax legislation . excluding the estimated impact of tax legislation , the effective income tax rate for 2017 was 22.0% ( 22.0 % ) , down from 28.2% ( 28.2 % ) for 2016 . this decrease was primarily due to tax benefits on the settlement of employee share-based awards in accordance with asu no . 2016-09 . the impact of these settlements in 2017 was a reduction to our provision for taxes of $ 719 million and a reduction in our effective income tax

classification , interest and penalties on income taxes , accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures . we adopted fin 48 on january 1 , 2007 . prior to the adoption of fin 48 we had a long term tax liability for expected settlement of various federal , state and foreign income tax liabilities that was reflected net of the corollary tax impact of these expected settlements of $ 102.1 million , as well as a separate accrued interest liability of $ 1.7 million . as a result of the adoption of fin 48 , we are required to present the different components of such liability on a gross basis versus the historical net presentation . the adoption resulted in the financial statement liability for unrecognized tax benefits decreasing by $ 6.4 million as of january 1 , 2007 . the adoption resulted in this decrease in the liability as well as a reduction to retained earnings of $ 4.8 million , a reduction in goodwill of $ 61.4 million , the establishment of a tax receivable of $ 58.2 million , which was recorded in other current and non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheet , and an increase in an interest/penalty payable of $ 7.9 million , all as of january 1 , 2007 . therefore , after the adoption of fin 48 , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is $ 95.7 million as of january 1 , 2007 . as of december 31 , 2008 , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is $ 129.5 million . of this amount , $ 45.5 million would impact our effective tax rate if recognized . $ 38.2 million of the $ 129.5 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax positions of acquired entities taken prior to their acquisition by us . under fas 141 ( r ) , if these liabilities are settled for different amounts , they will affect the income tax expense in the period of reversal or settlement . the following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits ( in millions ) : .\n||2008|2007|\n|balance at january 1|$ 135.2|$ 95.7|\n|increases related to prior periods|12.1|27.4|\n|decreases related to prior periods|-32.0 ( 32.0 )|-5.5 ( 5.5 )|\n|increases related to current period|15.8|21.9|\n|decreases related to

accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings , which is consistent with the recognition of these items in prior reporting periods . as of december 31 , 2007 , we recorded a liability of $ 19.6 million for accrued interest and penalties , of which $ 14.7 million would impact our effective tax rate , if recognized . the amount of this liability is $ 22.9 million as of december 31 , 2008 . of this amount , $ 17.1 million would impact our effective tax rate , if recognized . we expect that the amount of tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months ; however , we do not expect these changes will have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position . the u.s . federal statute of limitations remains open for the year 2003 and onward . the u.s . federal returns for years 2003 and 2004 are currently under examination by the irs . on july 15 , 2008 , the irs issued its examination report . we filed a formal protest on august 15 , 2008 and requested a conference with the appeals office regarding disputed issues . although the appeals process could take several years , we do not anticipate resolution of the audit will result in any significant impact on our results of operations , financial position or cash flows . in addition , for the 1999 tax year of centerpulse , which we acquired in october 2003 , one issue remains in dispute . state income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of 3 to 5 years after filing of the respective return . the state impact of any federal changes remains subject to examination by various states for a period of up to one year after formal notification to the states . we have various state income tax returns in the process of examination , administrative appeals or litigation . it is z i m m e r h o l d i n g s , i n c . 2 0 0 8 f o r m 1 0 - k a n n u a l r e p

the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the firm . however , in management 2019s view , the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities ( primarily u.s . government and agency securities and other group of seven nations ( 201cg7

cash , g7 government securities , other liquid government-agency and guaranteed securities , and corporate debt and equity securities ) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions , as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date . although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above , it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client 2019s derivative

information on the firm 2019s use of collateral agreements , refer to note 5 . while useful as a current view of credit exposure , the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure . to capture the potential future variability of credit exposure , the firm calculates , on a client-by-client basis , three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss : peak , derivative risk equivalent ( 201cdre 201d ) , and average exposure ( 201cavg 201d ) . these measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits , where applicable . peak represents a conservative measure of potential exposure to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% ( 97.5 % ) confidence level over the life of

actions of various central banks ; changes in u.s . and non-u.s . interest rates ; changes in the various yield curves around the world ; revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards , or interpretations of those standards ; the amount of discount accretion generated by the former conduit securities that remain in our investment securities portfolio ; and the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the yields earned on securities sold or matured . based on market conditions and other factors , we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from pay-downs and maturities of investment securities in highly-rated securities , such as u.s . treasury and agency securities , municipal securities , federal agency mortgage-backed securities and u.s . and non-u.s . mortgage- and asset-backed securities . the pace at which we continue to reinvest and the types of investment securities purchased will depend on the impact of market conditions and other factors over time . we expect these factors and the levels of global interest rates to influence what effect our reinvestment program will have on future levels of our net interest revenue and net interest margin. .\nQuestion: what is the percent change in average u.s . short-duration advances between 2012 and 2013?\nAnswer:",

improvement in the provision for credit losses , which was a benefit in 2011 , partially offset by a reduction in the value of commercial mortgage servicing rights and lower net interest income . we continued to focus on adding new clients , increasing cross sales , and remaining committed to strong expense discipline . asset management group asset management group earned $ 141 million for 2011 compared with $ 137 million for 2010 . assets under administration were $ 210 billion at december 31 , 2011 and $ 212 billion at december 31 , 2010 . earnings for 2011 reflected a benefit from the provision for credit losses and growth in noninterest income , partially offset by higher noninterest expense and lower net interest income . for 2011 , the business delivered strong sales production , grew high value clients and benefitted from significant referrals from other pnc lines of business . over time and with stabilized market conditions , the successful execution of these strategies and the accumulation of our strong sales performance are expected to create meaningful growth in assets under management and noninterest income . residential mortgage banking residential mortgage banking earned $ 87 million in 2011 compared with $ 269 million in 2010 . the decline in earnings was driven by an increase in noninterest expense associated with increased costs for residential mortgage foreclosure- related expenses , primarily as a result of ongoing governmental matters , and lower net interest income , partially offset by an increase in loan originations and higher loans sales revenue . blackrock our blackrock business segment earned $ 361 million in 2011 and $ 351 million in 2010 . the higher business segment earnings from blackrock for 2011 compared with 2010 were primarily due to an increase in revenue . non-strategic assets portfolio this business segment ( formerly distressed assets portfolio ) consists primarily of acquired non-strategic assets that fall outside of our core business strategy . non-strategic assets portfolio had earnings of $ 200 million in 2011 compared with a loss of $ 57 million in 2010 . the increase was primarily attributable to a lower provision for credit losses partially offset by lower net interest income . 201cother 201d reported earnings of $ 376 million for 2011 compared with earnings of $ 386 million for 2010 . the decrease in earnings primarily reflected the noncash charge related to the redemption of trust preferred securities in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the gain related to the sale of a portion of pnc 2019s blackrock shares in 2010 partially offset by lower integration costs in 2011 . consolidated income statement review our consolidated income statement is presented in item 8 of this report . net income for 2011 was $ 3.1 billion compared with $ 3.4 billion for 2010 . results for 2011 include the impact of $ 324 million of residential mortgage foreclosure-related expenses primarily as a result of ongoing governmental matters , a $ 198 million noncash charge related to redemption of trust preferred securities and $ 42 million for integration costs . results for 2010 included the $ 328

however , since the timing and amounts of expected cash flows for these purchased credit-impaired loans are reasonably estimable , interest is being accreted and the loans are being reported as performing loans . charge-offs are not recorded on purchased credit-impaired loans until actual losses exceed the estimated losses that were recorded as purchase accounting adjustments at acquisition date . to date , no charge-offs have been recorded for these loans . purchased credit-impaired loans acquired in the washington mu- tual transaction are reported in loans on the firm 2019s consolidated balance sheets . in 2009 , an allowance for loan losses of $ 1.6 billion was recorded for the prime mortgage and option arm pools of loans . the net aggregate carrying amount of the pools that have an allowance for loan losses was $ 47.2 billion at december 31 , 2009 . this allowance for loan losses is reported as a reduction of the carrying amount of the loans in the table below . the table below provides additional information about these pur- chased credit-impaired consumer loans. .\n|december 31 ( in millions )|2009|2008|\n|outstanding balance ( a )|$ 103369|$ 118180|\n|carrying amount|79664|88813|\n( a ) represents the sum of contractual principal , interest and fees earned at the reporting date . purchased credit-impaired loans are also being modified under the mha programs and the firm 2019s other loss mitigation programs . for these loans , the impact of the modification is incorporated into the firm 2019s quarterly assessment of whether a probable and/or signifi- cant change in estimated future cash flows has occurred , and the loans continue to be accounted for as and reported as purchased credit-impaired loans . foreclosed property the firm acquires property from borrowers through loan restructur- ings , workouts , and foreclosures , which is recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets . property acquired may include real property ( e.g. , land , buildings , and fixtures ) and commercial and personal property ( e.g. , aircraft , railcars , and ships ) . acquired property is valued at fair value less costs to sell at acquisition . each quarter the fair value of the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted , if necessary . any adjustments to fair value in the first 90 days are charged to the allowance for loan losses and thereafter adjustments are charged/credited to noninterest revenue 2013other . operating expense , such as real estate taxes and maintenance , are charged to other expense . note 14 2013 allowance for credit losses the allowance for loan losses includes an asset-specific component , a formula-based component and a component related to purchased credit-impaired loans . the asset-specific component relates to loans considered to be impaired , which includes any loans that have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring as well as risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status . an asset-specific allowance for impaired loans is established when the loan 2019s discounted cash flows ( or , when available , the loan 2019s observable market price ) is lower than the recorded investment in the loan . to compute the asset-specific component of the allowance , larger loans are evaluated individually , while smaller loans are evaluated as pools using historical loss experience for the respective class of assets . risk-rated loans ( primarily wholesale loans ) are pooled by risk rating , while scored loans ( i.e. , consumer loans ) are pooled by product type . the firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected , dis- counted at the loan 2019s original effective interest rate . subsequent changes in measured impairment due to the impact of discounting are reported as an adjustment to the provision for loan losses , not as an adjustment to interest income . an asset-specific allowance for an impaired loan with an observable market price is measured as the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the loan 2019s fair value . certain impaired loans that are determined to be collateral- dependent are charged-off to the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell . when collateral-dependent commercial real-estate loans are determined to be impaired , updated appraisals are typi- cally obtained and updated every six to twelve months . the firm also considers both borrower- and market-specific factors , which .\nQuestion: for 2009 , what was the net reserve allowance on the prime mortgage and option arm pools of loans , in millions?\\\\n\nAnswer:",

1% ( 1 % ) due to improved volumes as increases in our aerospace , architectural and original equipment automotive businesses offset volume declines in automotive refinish and industrial coatings ; and 1% ( 1 % ) due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation . operating income decreased $ 168 million in 2005 . the adverse impact of inflation totaled $ 315 million , of which $ 245 million was attributable to higher raw material costs . higher year-over-year selling prices increased operating earnings by $ 169 million . coatings operating earnings were reduced by the $ 132 million charge for the cost of the marvin legal settlement net of insurance recoveries . other factors increasing coatings operating income in 2005 were the increased sales volumes described above , manufacturing efficiencies , formula cost reductions and higher other income . glass sales increased $ 33 million or 1% ( 1 % ) in 2005 . sales increased 1% ( 1 % ) due to improved volumes as increases in our automotive replacement glass , insurance and services and performance glazings ( flat glass ) businesses offset volume declines in our fiber glass and automotive original equipment glass businesses . the positive effects of foreign currency translation were largely offset by lower selling prices primarily in our automotive replacement glass and automotive original equipment businesses . operating income decreased $ 113 million in 2005 . the federal glass class action antitrust legal settlement of $ 61 million , the $ 49 million impact of rising natural gas costs and the absence of the $ 19 million gain in 2004 from the sale/ leaseback of precious metal combined to account for a reduction in operating earnings of $ 129 million . the remaining year-over-year increase in glass operating earnings of $ 16 million resulted primarily from improved manufacturing efficiencies and lower overhead costs exceeding the adverse impact of other inflation . our continuing efforts in 2005 to position the fiber glass business for future growth in profitability were adversely impacted by the rise in fourth quarter natural gas prices , slightly lower year-over-year sales , lower equity earnings due to weaker pricing in the asian electronics market , and the absence of the $ 19 million gain which occurred in 2004 stemming from the sale/ leaseback of precious metals . despite high energy costs , we expect fiber glass earnings to improve in 2006 because of price strengthening in the asian electronics market , which began to occur in the fourth quarter of 2005 , increased cost reduction initiatives and the positive impact resulting from the start up of our new joint venture in china . this joint venture will produce high labor content fiber glass reinforcement products and take advantage of lower labor costs , allowing us to refocus our u.s . production capacity on higher margin direct process products . the 2005 operating earnings of our north american automotive oem glass business declined by $ 30 million compared with 2004 . significant structural changes continue to occur in the north american automotive industry , including the loss of u.s . market share by general motors and ford . this has created a very challenging and competitive environment for all suppliers to the domestic oems , including our business . about half of the decline in earnings resulted from the impact of rising natural gas costs , particularly in the fourth quarter , combined with the traditional adverse impact of year-over-year sales price reductions producing a decline in earnings that exceeded our successful efforts to reduce manufacturing costs . the other half of the 2005 decline was due to lower sales volumes and mix and higher new program launch costs . the challenging competitive environment and high energy prices will continue in 2006 . our business is working in 2006 to improve its performance through increased manufacturing efficiencies , structural cost reduction initiatives , focusing on profitable growth opportunities and improving our sales mix . chemicals sales increased $ 364 million or 18% ( 18 % ) in 2005 . sales increased 21% ( 21 % ) due to higher selling prices , primarily for chlor-alkali products , and 1% ( 1 % ) due to the combination of an acquisition in our optical products business and the positive effects of foreign currency translation . total volumes declined 4% ( 4 % ) as volume increases in optical products were more than offset by volume declines in chlor-alkali and fine chemicals . volume in chlor-alkali products and silicas were adversely impacted in the third and fourth quarters by the hurricanes . operating income increased $ 160 million in 2005 . the primary factor increasing operating income was the record high selling prices in chlor-alkali . factors decreasing operating income were higher inflation , including $ 136 million due to increased energy and ethylene costs ; $ 34 million of direct costs related to the impact of the hurricanes ; $ 27 million due to the asset impairment charge related to our fine chemicals business ; lower sales volumes ; higher manufacturing costs and increased environmental expenses . the increase in chemicals operating earnings occurred primarily through the first eight months of 2005 . the hurricanes hit in september impacting volumes and costs in september through november and contributing to the rise in natural gas prices which lowered fourth quarter chemicals earnings by $ 58 million , almost 57% ( 57 % ) of the full year impact of higher natural gas prices . the damage caused by hurricane rita resulted in the shutdown of our lake charles , la chemical plant for a total of eight days in september and an additional five 18 2005 ppg annual report and form 10-k .\nQuestion: what is the operating income percentage for 2005 in the glass segment?\nAnswer:",

are estimated to have contributed $ 133 million and $ 41 million , respectively . fuel rate recoveries increased approximately $ 65 million for 2002 . these recoveries are generally offset by increases in elec- tric fuel expense and do not materially affect income . partially offsetting these increases was a net decrease of $ 60 million due to other factors not separately measurable , such as the impact of economic conditions on customer usage , as well as variations in seasonal rate premiums and discounts . nonregulated electric sales revenue increased $ 9 million . sales revenue from dominion 2019s merchant generation fleet decreased $ 21 million , reflecting a $ 201 million decline due to lower prices partially offset by sales from assets acquired and constructed in 2002 and the

lion of realized and unrealized losses on the economic hedges of natural gas production by the dominion exploration & pro- duction segment . as described below under selected information 2014 energy trading activities , sales of natural gas by the dominion exploration & production segment at market prices offset these financial losses , resulting in a range of prices contemplated by dominion

an increase of $ 28 million associated with utility operations . substantially all of the increase associated with non-regulated energy marketing opera- tions related to higher volumes purchased

million secured floating rate term loan . we also assumed $ 29.9 million of secured debt in conjunction with a property acquisition in atlanta . 25cf the average balance and average borrowing rate of our $ 500 million revolving credit facility were slightly higher in 2004 than in 2003 . at the end of 2004 we were not utilizing our credit facility . depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased from $ 188.0 million in 2003 to $ 224.6 million in 2004 as a result of increased capital spending associated with increased leasing , the additional basis resulting from acquisitions , development activity and the application of sfas 141 as described below . the points below highlight the significant increase in depreciation and amortization . 25cf depreciation expense on tenant improvements increased by $ 14.1 million . 25cf depreciation expense on buildings increased by $ 6.0 million . 25cf lease commission amortization increased by $ 2.2 million . the amortization expense associated with acquired lease intangible assets increased by approximately $ 10.0 million . the acquisitions were accounted for in accordance with sfas 141 which requires the allocation of a portion of a property 2019s purchase price to intangible assets for leases acquired and in-place at the closing date of the acquisition . these intangible assets are amortized over the remaining life of the leases ( generally 3-5 years ) as compared to the building basis portion of the acquisition , which is depreciated over 40 years . service operations service operations primarily consist of our merchant building sales and the leasing , management , construction and development services for joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties . these operations are heavily influenced by the current state of the economy as leasing and management fees are dependent upon occupancy while construction and development services rely on businesses expanding operations . service operations earnings increased from $ 21.8 million in 2003 to $ 24.4 million in 2004 . the increase reflects higher construction volumes partially offset by increased staffing costs for our new national development and construction group and construction jobs in certain markets . other factors impacting service operations are discussed below . 25cf we experienced a 1.6% ( 1.6 % ) decrease in our overall gross profit margin percentage in our general contractor business in 2004 as compared to 2003 , due to continued competitive pricing pressure in many of our markets . we expect margins to increase in 2005 as economic conditions improve . however , despite this decrease , we were able to increase our net general contractor revenues from $ 26.8 million in 2003 to $ 27.6 million in 2004 because of an increase in volume . this volume increase was attributable to continued low financing costs available to businesses , thereby making it more attractive for them to own instead of lease facilities . we have a substantial backlog of $ 183.2 million for third party construction as of december 31 , 2004 , that will carry into 2005 . 25cf our merchant building development and sales program , whereby a building is developed by us and then sold , is a significant component of construction and development income . during 2004 , we generated after tax gains of $ 16.5 million from the sale of six properties compared to $ 9.6 million from the sale of four properties in 2003 . profit margins on these types of building sales fluctuate by sale depending on the type of property being sold , the strength of the underlying tenant and nature of the sale , such as a pre-contracted purchase price for a primary tenant versus a sale on the open market . general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased from $ 22.1 million in 2003 to $ 26.4 million in 2004 . the increase was a result of increased staffing and employee

for annual grants under the 2009 plan to our executive officers is expected to occur in the first quarter of each year following the earnings announcements for the previous quarter and full year . the stock plan for non-employee directors provides for awards of stock options , restricted stock and rsus to non-employee directors . it has been our practice to issue shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options from previously unissued shares , except in limited circumstances where they are issued from treasury stock . the total number of awards which may be granted in a given year

plans , vesting may accelerate upon retirement after the first anniversary date of the award if certain criteria are met . we recognize expense related to stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period , less awards expected to be forfeited using estimated forfeiture rates . due to the accelerated retirement provisions , the requisite service period of our stock options range from one to four years . stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant , except in limited circumstances where local law may

        "input": "capitalized software : internally developed computer software costs and costs of product enhancements are capitalized subsequent to the determination of technological feasibility ; such capitalization continues until the product becomes available for commercial release . judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established . the company has determined that technological feasibility is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing . generally , the time between the establishment of technological feasibility and commercial release of software is minimal , resulting in insignificant or no capitalization of internally developed software costs . amortization of capitalized software costs , both for internally developed as well as for purchased software products , is computed on a product-by-product basis over the estimated economic life of the product , which is generally three years . amortization is the greater of the amount computed using : ( i ) the ratio of the current year 2019s gross revenue to the total current and anticipated future gross revenue for that product or ( ii ) the straight-line method over the estimated life of the product . amortization expense related to capitalized and acquired software costs , including the related trademarks , was $ 40.9 million , $ 33.7 million and $ 32.8 million for the years ended december 31 , 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . the company periodically reviews the carrying value of capitalized software . impairments are recognized in the results of operations when the expected future undiscounted operating cash flow derived from the capitalized costs of internally developed software is less than the carrying value . no impairment charges have been required to date . goodwill and other intangible assets : goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired . intangible assets consist of trademarks , customer lists , contract backlog , and acquired software and technology . the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually by performing a qualitative assessment of whether there is sufficient evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount . the application of a qualitative assessment requires the company to assess and make judgments regarding a variety of factors which potentially impact the fair value of a reporting unit , including general economic conditions , industry and market-specific conditions , customer behavior , cost factors , the company 2019s financial performance and trends , the company 2019s strategies and business plans , capital requirements , management and personnel issues , and the company 2019s stock price , among others . the company then considers the totality of these and other factors , placing more weight on the events and circumstances that are judged to most affect a reporting unit 2019s fair value or the carrying amount of its net assets , to reach a qualitative conclusion regarding whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount . if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value , no further analysis is necessary . if it is determined that it is more likely than not the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value , a quantitative two-step analysis is performed where the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated and the impairment loss , if any , is recorded . the company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually by comparing the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value . the company performs its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test on january 1 of each year unless there is an indicator that would require a test during the year . the company periodically reviews the carrying value of other intangible assets and will recognize impairments when events or circumstances indicate that such assets may be impaired . no impairment charges have been required to date for the company's goodwill and other intangible assets . concentrations of credit risk : the company has a concentration of credit risk with respect to revenue and trade receivables due to the use of certain significant channel partners to market and sell the company 2019s products . the

( 2 ) trends in recent repurchases and make-wholes ; ( 3 ) historical percentage of claims made as a percentage of loan documentation package requests ; ( 4 ) success rate in appealing claims ; ( 5 ) inventory of unresolved claims ; and ( 6 ) estimated loss given repurchase or make-whole , including the loss of principal , accrued interest , and foreclosure costs . the company does not change its estimation methodology by counterparty , but the historical experience and trends are considered when evaluating the overall reserve . the request for loan documentation packages is an early indicator of a potential claim . during 2009 , loan documentation package requests and the level of outstanding claims increased . in addition , our loss severity estimates increased during 2009 due to the impact of macroeconomic factors and recent experience . these factors contributed to a $ 493 million change in estimate for this reserve in 2009 . as indicated above , the repurchase reserve is calculated by sales vintage . the majority of the repurchases in 2009 were from the 2006 and 2007 sales vintages , which also represent the vintages with the largest loss- given-repurchase . an insignificant percentage of 2009 repurchases were from vintages prior to 2006 , and this is expected to decrease , because those vintages are later in the credit cycle . although early in the credit cycle , the company has experienced improved repurchase and loss-given-repurchase statistics from the 2008 and 2009 vintages . in the case of a repurchase of a credit-impaired sop 03-3 loan ( now incorporated into asc 310-30 ) , the difference between the loan 2019s fair value and unpaid principal balance at the time of the repurchase is recorded as a utilization of the repurchase reserve . payments to make the investor whole are also treated as utilizations and charged directly against the reserve . the provision for estimated probable losses arising from loan sales is recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale , which is included in other revenue in the consolidated statement of income . a liability for representations and warranties is estimated when the company sells loans and is updated quarterly . any subsequent adjustment to the provision is recorded in other revenue in the consolidated statement of income . the activity in the repurchase reserve for the years ended december 31 , 2009 and 2008 is as follows: .\n|in millions of dollars|2009|2008|\n|balance beginning of the year|$ 75|$ 2|\n|additions for new sales|33|23|\n|change in estimate|493|59|\n|utilizations|-119 ( 119 )|-9 ( 9 )|\n|balance end of the year|$ 482|$ 75|\ngoodwill goodwill represents an acquired company 2019s acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired . goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests , whereby goodwill is allocated to the company 2019s reporting units and an impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value . furthermore , on any business dispositions , goodwill is allocated to the business disposed of based on the ratio of the fair value of the business disposed of to the fair value of the reporting unit . intangible assets intangible assets 2014including core deposit intangibles , present value of future profits , purchased credit card relationships , other customer relationships , and other intangible assets , but excluding msrs 2014are amortized over their estimated useful lives . intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives , primarily certain asset management contracts and trade names , are not amortized and are subject to annual impairment tests . an impairment exists if the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value . for other intangible assets subject to amortization , an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset . other assets and other liabilities other assets include , among other items , loans held-for-sale , deferred tax assets , equity-method investments , interest and fees receivable , premises and equipment , end-user derivatives in a net receivable position , repossessed assets , and other receivables. .\nQuestion: what was the percent of the increase the additions for new sales of the repurchase reserve from 2008 to 2009\nAnswer:",

about $ 285 million from f-16 programs primarily due to higher aircraft deliveries ( 37 f-16 aircraft delivered in 2012 compared to 22 in 2011 ) partially offset by lower volume on sustainment activities due to the completion of modification programs for certain international customers ; and approximately $ 140 million from c-5 programs due to higher aircraft deliveries ( four c-5m aircraft delivered in 2012 compared to two in 2011 ) . partially offsetting the increases were lower net sales of approximately $ 365 million from decreased production volume and lower risk retirements on the f-22 program as final aircraft deliveries were completed in the second quarter of 2012 ; approximately $ 110 million from the f-35 development contract primarily due to the inception-to-date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the second quarter of 2012 and to a lesser extent lower volume ; and about $ 95 million from a decrease in volume on other sustainment activities partially offset by various other aeronautics programs due to higher volume . net sales for c-130 programs were comparable to 2011 as a decline in sustainment activities largely was offset by increased aircraft deliveries . aeronautics 2019 operating profit for 2012 increased $ 69 million , or 4% ( 4 % ) , compared to 2011 . the increase was attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $ 105 million from c-130 programs due to an increase in risk retirements ; about $ 50 million from f-16 programs due to higher aircraft deliveries partially offset by a decline in risk retirements ; approximately $ 50 million from f-35 lrip contracts due to increased production volume and risk retirements ; and about $ 50 million from the completion of purchased intangible asset amortization on certain f-16 contracts . partially offsetting the increases was lower operating profit of about $ 90 million from the f-35 development contract primarily due to the inception- to-date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the second quarter of 2012 ; approximately $ 50 million from decreased production volume and risk retirements on the f-22 program partially offset by a resolution of a contractual matter in the second quarter of 2012 ; and approximately $ 45 million primarily due to a decrease in risk retirements on other sustainment activities partially offset by various other aeronautics programs due to increased risk retirements and volume . operating profit for c-5 programs was comparable to 2011 . adjustments not related to volume , including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters described above , were approximately $ 30 million lower for 2012 compared to 2011 . 2011 compared to 2010 aeronautics 2019 net sales for 2011 increased $ 1.3 billion , or 10% ( 10 % ) , compared to 2010 . the growth in net sales primarily was due to higher volume of about $ 850 million for work performed on the f-35 lrip contracts as production increased ; higher volume of about $ 745 million for c-130 programs due to an increase in deliveries ( 33 c-130j aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to 25 during 2010 ) and support activities ; about $ 425 million for f-16 support activities and an increase in aircraft deliveries ( 22 f-16 aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to 20 during 2010 ) ;

301|$ 985|$ 179|\neffective january 1 , 2018 , we adopted new accounting guidance issued by the fasb related to the presentation of net periodic pension and opeb costs . this guidance requires that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net benefit cost . service cost is required to be reported in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period . the other components of net benefit cost are required to be reported outside the subtotal for income from operations . as a result , components of pension and opeb costs , other than service costs , will be reclassified from operating costs to other income/expense . this change will be applied retrospectively to prior years . in the fourth quarter of 2017 , the company reviewed and made changes to the mortality assumptions primarily for our u.s . pension plans which resulted in an overall increase in the life expectancy of plan participants . as of december 31 , 2017 these changes resulted in an increase in our liability for postemployment benefits of approximately $ 290 million . in the fourth quarter of 2016 , the company adopted new mortality improvement scales released by the soa for our u.s . pension and opeb plans . as of december 31 , 2016 , this resulted in an increase in our liability for postemployment benefits of approximately $ 200 million . in the first quarter of 2017 , we announced the closure of our gosselies , belgium facility . this announcement impacted certain employees that participated in a defined benefit pension plan and resulted in a curtailment and the recognition of termination benefits . in march 2017 , we recognized a net loss of $ 20 million for the curtailment and termination benefits . in addition , we announced the decision to phase out production at our aurora , illinois , facility , which resulted in termination benefits of $ 9 million for certain hourly employees that participate in our u.s . hourly defined benefit pension plan . beginning in 2016 , we elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows . service and interest costs in 2017 and 2016 were lower by $ 140 million and $ 180 million , respectively , under the new method than they would have been under the previous method . this change had no impact on our year-end defined benefit pension and opeb obligations or our annual net periodic benefit cost as the lower service and interest costs were entirely offset in the actuarial loss ( gain ) reported for the respective year . we expect our total defined benefit pension and opeb expense ( excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses ) to decrease approximately $ 80 million in 2018 . this decrease is primarily due to a higher expected return on plan assets as a result of a higher asset base in 2018 . in general , our strategy for both the u.s . and the non-u.s . pensions includes ongoing alignment of our investments to our liabilities , while reducing risk in our portfolio . for our u.s . pension plans , our year-end 2017 asset allocation was 34 a0percent equities , 62 a0percent fixed income and 4 percent other . our current u.s . pension target asset allocation is 30 percent equities and 70 percent fixed income . the target allocation is revisited periodically to ensure it reflects our overall objectives . the u.s . plans are rebalanced to plus or minus 5 percentage points of the target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis . the year-end 2017 asset allocation for our non-u.s . pension

firm or a counterparty has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date . at december 31 , 2010 and 2009 , the firm had received $ 18.0 billion and $ 16.9 billion , respectively , and delivered $ 8.4 billion and $ 5.8 billion , respectively , of such additional collateral . these amounts were not netted against the derivative receivables and payables in the table above , because , at an individual counterparty level , the collateral exceeded the fair value exposure at december 31 , 2010 and 2009 . credit derivatives credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer ( the reference entity ) and which allow one party ( the protection purchaser ) to transfer that risk to another party ( the protection seller ) . credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller , as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event , such as a bankruptcy , a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring . the seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event . the firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes . first , in its capacity as a market-maker in the dealer/client business , the firm actively risk manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection , pre- dominantly on corporate debt obligations , to meet the needs of customers . as a seller of protection , the firm 2019s exposure to a given reference entity may be offset partially , or entirely , with a contract to purchase protection from another counterparty on the same or similar reference entity . second , the firm uses credit derivatives to mitigate credit risk associated with its overall derivative receivables and traditional commercial credit lending exposures ( loans and unfunded commitments ) as well as to manage its exposure to residential and commercial mortgages . see note 3 on pages 170 2013 187 of this annual report for further information on the firm 2019s mortgage-related exposures . in accomplishing the above , the firm uses different types of credit derivatives . following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives . credit default swaps credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single refer- ence entity ( 201csingle-name 201d ) or a broad-based index . the firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index- reference obligations . single-name cds and index cds contracts are otc derivative contracts . single-name cds are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity , while index cds con- tracts are used to manage the credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments . like the s&p 500 and other market indices , a cds index comprises a portfolio of cds across many reference entities . new series of cds indices are periodically established with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets . if one of the refer- ence entities in the index experiences a credit event , then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index . cds can also be referenced against specific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client de- mands : for example , to provide protection against the first $ 1 million of realized credit losses in a $ 10 million portfolio of expo- sure . such structures are commonly known as tranche cds . for both single-name cds contracts and index cds contracts , upon the occurrence of a credit event , under the terms of a cds contract neither party to the cds contract has recourse to the reference entity . the protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the cds contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settling the credit derivative contract , also known as the recovery value . the protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the cds contract when a credit event occurs . credit-related notes a credit-related note is a funded credit derivative where the issuer of the credit-related note purchases from the note investor credit protec- tion on a referenced entity . under the contract , the investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the inception of the transaction , and in return , the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor , based on the credit risk of the referenced entity . the issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity experiences a specified credit event . if a credit event .\nQuestion: for 2010 , how much in billions would the credit risk balance be reduced if the table

2022 at the lower of cost or fair value , with valuation changes record- ed in noninterest revenue , for loans that are classified as held- for-sale ; or 2022 at fair value , with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue , for loans classified as trading assets or risk managed on a fair value basis ; 2022 purchased credit-impaired loans held for investment are account- ed for under sop 03-3 and initially measured at fair value , which includes estimated future credit losses . accordingly , an allowance for loan losses related to these loans is not recorded at the acquisition date . see note 5 on pages 156 2013158 of this annual report for further information on the firm 2019s elections of fair value accounting under sfas 159 . see note 6 on pages 158 2013160 of this annual report for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets . for loans held for investment , other than purchased credit-impaired loans , interest income is recognized using the interest method or on a basis approximating a level rate of return over the term of the loan . loans within the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are transferred to the held-for-sale portfolio . transfers to held-for-sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer . credit-related losses are charged off to the allowance for loan losses and losses due to changes in interest rates , or exchange rates , are recognized in noninterest revenue . loans within the held-for-sale portfolio that management decides to retain are transferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value . these loans are subsequently assessed for impairment based on the firm 2019s allowance methodology . for a fur- ther discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the firm 2019s allowance for loan losses , see note 15 on pages 178 2013180 of this annual report . nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest is dis- continued . loans ( other than certain consumer and purchased credit- impaired loans discussed below ) are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if , in the opinion of management , full payment of princi- pal or interest is in doubt , or when principal or interest is 90 days or more past due and collateral , if any , is insufficient to cover principal and interest . loans are charged off to the allowance for loan losses when it is highly certain that a loss has been realized . interest accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed against interest income . in addition , the amortiza- tion of net deferred loan fees is suspended . interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized only to the extent it is received in cash . however , where there is doubt regarding the ultimate col- lectibility of loan principal , all cash thereafter received is applied to reduce the carrying value of such loans ( i.e. , the cost recovery method ) . loans are restored to accrual status only when future pay- ments of interest and principal are reasonably assured . consumer loans , other than purchased credit-impaired loans , are generally charged to the allowance for loan losses upon reaching specified stages of delinquency , in accordance with the federal financial institutions examination council policy . for example , credit card loans are charged off by the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due or within 60 days from receiv- ing notification of the filing of bankruptcy , whichever is earlier . residential mortgage products are generally charged off to net real- izable value at no later than 180 days past due . other consumer .\nQuestion: what was the ratio of the securities purchased under resale agreements to the of the resale agreements accounted for at fair value\nAnswer:",

2008 and $ 3.5 billion in 2007 . operating earnings in 2009 were $ 746 million ( $ 307 million excluding alter- native fuel mixture credits and plant closure costs ) compared with $ 405 million ( $ 435 million excluding shutdown costs for a paper machine ) in 2008 and $ 415 million in 2007 . sales volumes decreased sig- nificantly in 2009 compared with 2008 reflecting weak customer demand and reduced production capacity resulting from the shutdown of a paper machine at the franklin mill in december 2008 and the conversion of the bastrop mill to pulp production in june 2008 . average sales price realizations were lower reflecting slight declines for uncoated freesheet paper in domestic markets and significant declines in export markets . margins were also unfavorably affected by a higher proportion of shipments to lower-margin export markets . input costs , however , were favorable due to lower wood and chemical costs and sig- nificantly lower energy costs . freight costs were also lower . planned maintenance downtime costs in 2009 were comparable with 2008 . operating costs were favorable , reflecting cost control efforts and strong machine performance . lack-of-order downtime increased to 525000 tons in 2009 , including 120000 tons related to the shutdown of a paper machine at our franklin mill in the 2008 fourth quarter , from 135000 tons in 2008 . operating earnings in 2009 included $ 671 million of alternative fuel mixture cred- its , $ 223 million of costs associated with the shutdown of our franklin mill and $ 9 million of other shutdown costs , while operating earnings in 2008 included $ 30 million of costs for the shutdown of a paper machine at our franklin mill . looking ahead to 2010 , first-quarter sales volumes are expected to increase slightly from fourth-quarter 2009 levels . average sales price realizations should be higher , reflecting the full-quarter impact of sales price increases announced in the fourth quarter for converting and envelope grades of uncoated free- sheet paper and an increase in prices to export markets . however , input costs for wood , energy and chemicals are expected to continue to increase . planned maintenance downtime costs should be lower and operating costs should be favorable . brazil ian papers net sales for 2009 of $ 960 mil- lion increased from $ 950 million in 2008 and $ 850 million in 2007 . operating profits for 2009 were $ 112 million compared with $ 186 million in 2008 and $ 174 million in 2007 . sales volumes increased in 2009 compared with 2008 for both paper and pulp reflect- ing higher export shipments . average sales price realizations were lower due to strong competitive pressures in the brazilian domestic market in the second half of the year , lower export prices and unfavorable foreign exchange rates . margins were unfavorably affected by a higher proportion of lower margin export sales . input costs for wood and chem- icals were favorable , but these benefits were partially offset by higher energy costs . planned maintenance downtime costs were lower , and operating costs were also favorable . earnings in 2009 were adversely impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange effects . entering 2010 , sales volumes are expected to be seasonally lower compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 . profit margins are expected to be slightly higher reflecting a more favorable geographic sales mix and improving sales price realizations in export markets , partially offset by higher planned main- tenance outage costs . european papers net sales in 2009 were $ 1.3 bil- lion compared with $ 1.7 billion in 2008 and $ 1.5 bil- lion in 2007 . operating profits in 2009 of $ 92 million ( $ 115 million excluding expenses associated with the closure of the inverurie mill ) compared with $ 39 mil- lion ( $ 146 million excluding a charge to reduce the carrying value of the fixed assets at the inverurie , scotland mill to their estimated realizable value ) in 2008 and $ 171 million in 2007 . sales volumes in 2009 were lower than in 2008 primarily due to reduced sales of uncoated freesheet paper following the closure of the inverurie mill in 2009 . average sales price realizations decreased significantly in 2009 across most of western europe , but margins increased in poland and russia reflecting the effect of local currency devaluations . input costs were favorable as lower wood costs , particularly in russia , were only partially offset by higher energy costs in poland and higher chemical costs . planned main- tenance downtime costs were higher in 2009 than in 2008 , while manufacturing operating costs were lower . operating profits in 2009 also reflect favorable foreign exchange impacts . looking ahead to 2010 , sales volumes are expected to decline from strong 2009 fourth-quarter levels despite solid customer demand . average sales price realizations are expected to increase over the quar- ter , primarily in eastern europe , as price increases .\nQuestion: what is the average operating profit?\nAnswer:",

plan . a total of 139 mmboe was booked as extensions , discoveries or other additions and revisions due to the application of reliable technology . technologies included statistical analysis of production performance , decline curve analysis , pressure and rate transient analysis , reservoir simulation and volumetric analysis . the observed statistical nature of production performance coupled with highly certain reservoir continuity or quality within the reliable technology areas and sufficient proved developed locations establish the reasonable certainty criteria required for booking proved reserves . transfers from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves included 47 mmboe in the eagle ford , 14 mmboe in the bakken and 5 mmboe in the oklahoma resource basins due to development drilling and completions . costs incurred in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves were $ 1415 million , $ 3149 million and $ 2536 million .

2010 . this development is being executed by the operator and encompasses a multi-year drilling program including the design , fabrication and installation of extensive liquid handling and gas recycling facilities . anecdotal evidence from similar development projects in the region leads to an expected project execution time frame of more than five years from the time the reserves were initially booked . interruptions associated with the civil and political unrest have also extended the project duration . operations were interrupted in mid-2013 as a result of the shutdown of the es sider crude oil terminal , and although temporarily re-opened during the second half of 2014 , production remains shut-in through early 2016 . the operator is committed to the project 2019s completion and continues to assign resources in order to execute the project . our conversion rate for proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves for 2015 was 11% ( 11 % ) . however , excluding the
