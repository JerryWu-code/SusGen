Policy Cooperation B. Financial Stability C. Capital Mobile Management Policy D. Inflow",

Principles of non -traditional monetary policy performance by the Fed\nIn this section, we will focus on the background and argument of the non -traditional monetary policy in the global financial crisis, focusing on several speeches from the Fed.\nThe Fed Chairman Bernanke explains how the Fed responded to the financial crisis after the summer of 2007 in a speech in London School of Economics in January 2009.First, in the process of lowering the federal interest rate, which is a policy rate in 2008, to the lower limit, it is mentioned that this expansion policy has helped to achieve the intention of improving the financial market situation.However, the financial situation worsened, as it was not enough and the credit spreads were expanded and the loan standards were strengthened.\nBernanke mentioned that it was noted in two things to provide liquidity to financial institutions.The first is that the credit donation has exposed the central bank to a minimum degree of credit (\u201cExposes the Federal Reserve to only Minimal Credit Risk\u201d).He also says that credit donation for financial institutions was not enough and it was inevitable to directly supply liquidity to borrowers and investors by intervening in some financial markets.The financial markets that intervened at the time included the CP market and the Asset-Backed Securities (ABS) market, according to them that these two markets played an important role in creating domestic credit.Bernanke focuses on how quantitative Easing, which focuses only on the expansion of reserves for financial institutions (debt of central banks), is focused on what bonds (central banks of central banks) are to resolve the credit cramps in contrast to the quantitative Easing.In the case, the Fed's non -traditional monetary policy was referred to as a credit relief.\nThere are two emphasis on the exit strategy.First, as the economic situation improves, the attractiveness of the central bank, which is imposed on high interest rates, will be lowered, and in the unusual and exigent situation under paragraph 13 (3) of the Federal Reserve Act.The intervention of the economy will disappear according to the law as the economy improves.Secondly, in order to stabilize the financial market, cooperation between the central bank, the elected power, the administration and the legislative wealth, and in this process, the belief of Too Big to fail should not spread between financial institutions.\nQuestion: \nWhat is not possible as credit spreads expand and loan standards have been strengthened?Options: A.

        "input": "\u2163.Economicity of rigid and stretched prices\nEarlier in terms of economic theory, chapter II introduced that rigid prices are likely to be inflation expectations and new prices.In this chapter, I would like to verify whether this relationship is empirically.\n1. Relationship between rigid prices and expectations\nFirst of all, we looked at the correlation between the two to see if rigid prices were actually linked to inflation expectations.As shown in the first figure in Figure 9, it can be seen that the rigid inflation rate is more similar to the expectation of inflation compared to the consumer price increase rate.In the second figure, in terms of correlation with inflation expectations, rigid prices showed higher correlation than consumer prices or stretch prices.It is interpreted as a result of the previous theoretical prediction that the items that are not easy to change due to the cost of menu are based on the expectation of the future inflation rate.\nHowever, in the second figure, it is possible to confirm that the correlation between rigid prices and inflation expectations in 2014 is temporarily weakened compared to accumulated prices or consumer prices.This seems to be due to the lower inflation expectation as the rate of increase in consumer prices has decreased due to the decrease in institutional factors such as free childcare and meals in 2012-2013, while rigid prices have continued to rise around personal services.\nSecond, we used a simple regression model to check how much information about inflation is reflected by each water price index.As shown in Table 1, the estimation of the three water index models showed that the coefficients of inflation expectations were statistically significant.However, in terms of model explanatory power, rigid prices were analyzed to reflect inflation expectations best.Therefore, it is interpreted as the result of the theoretical prediction that the items that are not easy to change are not easy to change.\nLastly, we have verified whether rigid prices are superior compared to priced prices and expectations of inflation in terms of consumer prices.As a result of the analysis, adding rigid prices as an information variable to the consumer -priced time series prediction model showed that the prediction of consumer price growth rate after 12 to 24 months, which is important in terms of monetary policy (Table 2).In addition, even if the expectation of inflation is added, the prediction of consumer price growth rate after 18-24 months was analyzed, but the improvement effect was less than the rigid price.\nQuestion: \nIn addition to the growth rate of consumer prices, what did you fall due to free childcare and expansion from 2012 to 2013?Options: A. Personal Service B. Inflation index C. Rigid Price D. Inflation Expectations",
        "output": "Influenced by the policy of expanding free childcare from 2012 to 2013, it was expected to be inflation among the inflation index along with the consumer price growth rate.As the expectation of inflation has decreased, consumer prices have also dropped.But rigid prices continued to rise around personal services.So the correct answer is D."

A. External Balance growth",

Economic growth over the last 60 years\nIn order to see Korea's economic growth over the past 60 years, national income statistics must be used.However, the national income statistics of Korea are disconnected from the current series of 1970, written by the 1993 SNA, the manual presented by the UN, and the 1953-1970, which was written by the 1953 SNA.The difference between Gu Gye -yeol and current affiliates is about 4.8%of the total GDP in 1970, when statistics overlap, and the difference by industry is greater.Moreover, since the Bank of Korea introduced a chain weight law into the current affiliate since 1970 and reorganized the standard year since 1970, the gap with the past time series under the fixed price law has widened.\nAccordingly, in order to see long -term economic fluctuations, it is necessary to retroactively apply the current GDP standards that apply the chain weight law.Since the official retroactive data has not been released yet, this paper uses various national account manuals, GDP materials, and past industrial associations in Korea, and applied a chain weight to 1953-1970.The range was matched and saved the long -term time series from 1953 to 2010.\nThe trend of economic growth over the past 60 years using the time series obtained is shown in Figure II-1.During the same period, Korea achieved an average growth of 7.6%, and Korea's real GDP, which remained at 22.2 billion won (based on 2005) in 1953, exceeded 1,000 trillion won in 2010.\nThe economic growth rate was divided by time, such as Table II-1, and the growth rate remained at 5.6%in the 50s, which included the Korean War, but gradually increased to 9.2%in the 60s and 10.3%in the 70s.This seems to have been based on the government's active economic development policy based on foreign vice ministers.Then, in the 80s, after the oil shock, it gradually dropped to 8.6%in the 80s, 6.7%in the 1990s when the financial crisis, and 4.6%in the 2000s when the global financial crisis was undergoing a global financial crisis.\nOn the other hand, in 1953, the agricultural and fishery was a typical agricultural country with 46.9%in all industries.The service industry (58.2%) has been transformed into an industrial country with a large proportion.In terms of industrial growth magnification from 1953 to 2010, the agricultural and forestry fisheries have increased by 4.2 times, while the manufacturing industry has expanded 664.3 times.\nQuestion: \nWhen we look at the Korean industrial structure in 1953, which industry accounts for 46.9 percent of all industries?Options: A.
