        "output": "The answer to the question of whether it is desirable to promote middle and low -risk furniture first is 'no'.Since disaster insurance is an insurance for property damage, it is desirable to allow high -risk groups to be highly likely to cause damage caused by disasters.\n\nIn the case of mid- and low -risk households, the need for disaster insurance is less likely because the possibility of damage caused by disasters is relatively low.In addition, premiums can increase if middle and low -risk households join disaster insurance.This is because the insurance premiums of disaster insurance are calculated based on the incidence of disasters.If you sign up for a lot of high -risk groups with high disaster incidence, the premium will increase, and the premium will fall if you join a lot of low -risk households with low disaster incidence.\n\n Therefore, the correct answer is NO."

        "input": "1.3.Oil price fluctuations and expected inflation\nExpected inflation is a concept that represents the subjective outlook of the economic agent on future inflation.\nDespite the tendency of expected inflation to converge on the price stabilization, the outlook for future inflation rate can be moved due to changes in variables on the macroeconomic overall economy.\nMehra and Herrington (2008) analyzed that the realized inflation, raw material prices and expected inflation themselves are the main variables affecting expected inflation, and these three variables describe about 95% of the expected inflation changes.\nIn the second half of 2014, oil prices have fallen significantly, as well as the US's realized consumer price indexes, as well as BEI of the price -linked country's BEI fell to less than 2%.\nAs such, there are two main ripple paths that oil prices fluctuate on the expectation of the expectations.\nFirst, when oil prices fluctuate, a Pass-Through effect is generated, which spreads the impact at the price of various products using crude oil.\nIf oil prices rise, the price of products based on crude oil, such as gasoline and diesel, increases, and the production cost of the entire industry that needs to operate the machine through fuel increases.\nHowever, oil prices are not immediately reflected in various product prices, but can be reflected after the time has passed.\nIn particular, if some prices have a rigid attribute, this can grow.\nTherefore, if oil prices fall, the inflation that is realized immediately in the consumer price index may be lowered, but the short -term anticipated inflation may fall as it reflects the expectation that the consumer price will increase due to the continued impact in the near future.\nSecondly, the principal and interest of water -linked national bonds are characterized by the price -linked product that it is linked to the past price index.\nIn the case of the US price -linked country, it is linked to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) about three months ago. During the monthly month, according to the linear interpolation law, the reference price index is determined as follows.\nSince the price index interlocking has three months of time difference, the actual change in the past three months is not immediately reflected in the profits (principal and interest) of the current price -linked country.\nHowever, since the interest rate of inflation -linked country bonds traded in the financial market is immediately reflected, the change in oil prices in the past three months from the present time can affect BEI.\nHowever, as a short -term, as a 10 -year -old expectation of inflation, the ripple effect and the delay effect of oil prices will be diluted for a long time, resulting in a small impact on oil prices.\nGiven the characteristics of BEI, it can be seen that the current oil price fluctuations can have a relatively strong impact on short -term BEI, but the influence of long -term water -linked national bonds will be relatively weak.\nQuestion: \nIs oil fluctuations greatly influenced by long -term expectations?",
        "output": "In the problem, you can see that the expectation of inflation is relatively weak in the long term.This is because relatively anticipated inflation of long -term organs, such as 10 years, dilutes the ripple effect and delay effect due to oil fluctuations for a long time, resulting in a small impact on oil prices.Therefore, the correct answer is NO."
