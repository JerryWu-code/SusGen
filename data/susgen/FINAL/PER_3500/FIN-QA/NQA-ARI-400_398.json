        "input": "The government will invest the budget and divide the credit card users and card companies to reduce the franchise commission rate in the early 0%.\nAccording to Yonhap News on the 22nd, the Financial Services Commission is preparing a comprehensive reform of credit card fees in order to support small self -employed people who have been hit by the minimum wage increase and reduction in income.\nAn official from the Financial Services Commission said, \u201cWe are looking for ways to share the card commissions of small and small merchants.\u201d\nThe goal of the Financial Services Commission is to lower the card commission rate to the early 0% and the small and medium -sized merchants to 0%.\nNow, the general affiliates of more than 500 million won are around 2%, sales of 300 million to 500 million won for small and medium -sized merchants are 1.3%, and sales of less than 300 million won are 0.8%.\nSmall self -employed workers are 'vulnerable groups' who are struggling with the minimum wage increase, and will persuade the budget authorities to propose that government support is inevitable.\nAlong with the government, credit card companies and users will also share the costs.\nSpecifically, card companies are planning to share the procurement costs, damages, and marketing costs among the so -called 'eligible costs'.\nIn this case, card companies are likely to respond to the increase in card annual fees.\nIn addition, the Financial Services Commission decided to apply preferential commission rate (1.3%for small and medium -sized merchants, 0.8%for small and medium -sized merchants) to next year to small business owners who sell products in open markets such as G -Market and 11th Street.They pay a commission of around 2% of general merchants.\nAn official from the FSC said, \u201cAs the burden of small business owners is increasing due to the increase in the minimum wage, the comprehensive reform of the card fee, which was scheduled for the end of the year, is accelerating, but as it deals with the structure of the card fee, it is scheduled for the basic procedures such as gathering opinions and deliberation courses.It's hard to speed up. \u201d\nQuestion: \nAccording to the Financial Services Commission, the credit card commission rate of small and medium -sized merchants of small and medium -sized merchants of 300 million won to small and medium -sized merchants of small and medium -sized merchants with less than 300 million won?",
        "output": "According to the text, the credit card commission rate of small merchants with sales of less than 300 million won is 0.8%, and the credit card commission rate for small and medium -sized merchants of 300 million to 500 million won is 1.3%.\n\n Therefore, the answer is 61.54 %."
