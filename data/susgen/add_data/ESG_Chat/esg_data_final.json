Improved ESG due diligence: SFDR encourages financial market participants to conduct proper due diligence on the ESG performance of companies they invest in. They are required to specify how they evaluate and assess the adverse impacts of their investments on sustainability factors. Consequently this may lead to additional scrutiny of companies' ESG practices potentially influencing your score based on the findings of such analysis.\n\n4. Investor preference: SFDR enhances the availability of ESG data and promotes ESG awareness and understanding among investors. With increased access to ESG information investors may prioritize companies with higher ESG scores or demonstrate stronger ESG commitments. If your ESG performance falls short compared to industry peers it may impact investor perception potentially affecting your ESG score.\n\nIt is important to note that your ESG score is determined by various factors beyond the SFDR. Other frameworks such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) along with independent ESG rating agencies also play a role in assessing and determining ESG scores."
