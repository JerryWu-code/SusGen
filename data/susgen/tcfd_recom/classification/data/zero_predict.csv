"A material portion of this network is still relatively immature and there are risks that may develop over time. For example, it is possible that branches may not be able to sustain the level of revenue or profitability that they currently achieve (or that it is forecasted that they will achieve).",0,2
"The investment horizon is between 3 and 15 years, because shorter investment horizons than this risk creating restrictions in the management, which can lead to poorer earnings, in part due to lower liquidity. Evaluation is over a rolling five-year period and the outcome of individual years should be interpreted with caution since strategic positions are taken in the medium term.",0,3
"The Group is exposed to multiple risks relating to the conduct of its general insurance business. The following risks noted below are not meant to represent an exhaustive list, but the risks faced by the Group that have been identified by the RMS process:  strategic risk: the risk of not achieving corporate or strategic goals;",0,2
"Business Risk Business risk describes the risk we assume due to potential changes in general business conditions, such as our market environment, client behavior and technological progress. This can affect our results if we fail to adjust quickly to these changing conditions. Business risk consists of strategic risk, tax risk and refinancing risk, of which only strategic risk is assessed as material.",0,2
"Identifying, quantifying and managing risk is complex and challenging. Although it is our policy and practice to identify and, where appropriate and practical, actively manage such risks to support objectives in managing capital and future financial security and flexibility, our policies and procedures may not adequately identify, monitor and quantify all risks.",0,2
"Regulatory risk is the risk of failure to meet new or existing regulatory and / or legislative requirements and deadlines, or a failure to embed compliant procedures into processes. It also includes the risk to the Group's capital, liquidity and profitability from the impact of future legislative and regulatory changes.",0,2
"5.2.11 Conflict minerals: issues further down the chain In line with Philips’ commitment to supply-chain sustainability, we are concerned about the situation in eastern DRC (the Democratic Republic of the Congo), where proceeds from the mining sector are used to finance rebel conflicts in the region. Philips does not directly source minerals from the DRC and the mines are typically seven or more tiers away from our direct suppliers. Philips nevertheless feels obliged to address this issue through the means and influencing mechanisms available to us.",0,2
"If Philips is unable to ensure effective supply chain management, e.g. facing an interruption of its supply chain, including the inability of third parties to deliver parts, components and services on time, and if it is subject to rising raw material prices, it may be unable to sustain its competitiveness in its markets.",0,2
"Risk and risk management Operational risk and compliance risk Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events including legal risk but excluding strategic and reputation risk. It also includes, among other things, technology risk, model risk and outsourcing risk.",0,3
"The Group considers risk management to be the key point in the financing business. We are therefore establishing a specialized risk management system that includes risk assessment standards specific to asset types, portfolio management, and monitoring methods. Under this management system, we will prioritize increasing transaction diversification as a concrete method of increasing operating assets exceeding ¥100 billion over the coming three years.",0,3
"It is also used to identify what are known as emerging risks, in other words risks which could potentially have an adverse impact on the Group’s future performance, although their result and horizontal time frame are uncertain and difficult to predict (for further details see section ‘Emerging risks’ from chapter C. Background and upcoming challenges).",0,3
"We also assess risks on the basis of their potential impact on the value of our franchise, which is supported by our reputation, brand and good customer relationships. Conduct and operational risks, such as cyber security breaches, data loss and IT systems failure, in particular have the potential to significantly impact our franchise value.",0,2
"The sensitivity analysis does not show a comprehensive picture of all potential scenarios. Further, variables do not tend to move in isolation, nor in a uniform or consistent manner, and the analysis does not show the potentially infinite number of permutations, and resultant impacts, that might arise in reality as a consequence.",0,3
"4. While Canadian financial regulations are considered to be best in kind, they may pose an obstacle for financial institutions in adapting to the fintech ecosystem. The study found that there is a growing disconnect between regulations and the latest technological advances. Current regulations make it difficult for Financial Firms to undertake the low-level, rapid experimentation required to develop safe, useful fintech products and services.",0,3
"Regulatory developments Globalization affects the insurance industry as well as its customers. Although many of today’s risks are globally interconnected and the largest insurers operate globally, insurance regulation is still mainly focused on national markets. From a global perspective, the regulatory framework is fragmented. This threatens the efficient use of capital and makes it harder for global insurers to fulfil their potential as bearers of risk. As a global insurer, Zurich advocates a consolidated group-wide approach to regulation, such as the International Association of Insurance Supervisors’ Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups initiative.",0,2
"We meet the financing needs of our customers with a broad and modern product range. The focus of the portfolio is on traditional owner-occupied home financing and the financing of real estate capital investments (residential mortgage loans and investment properties with a total EaD of €61bn). We provide our business customers with credit in the form of individual loans with a volume of €14bn. In addition, we meet our customers’ day-to-day demand for credit with consumer loans (consumer and instalment loans, credit cards to a total of €10bn).",0,1

Risks to the Group’s reputation Risks include acts or omissions by the Group or any of its employees that could damage the Group’s reputation or lead to a loss of trust among its stakeholders. Every risk type has potential consequences for Zurich’s reputation. Effectively managing each type of risk helps reduce such threats.,0,2
"As a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing, as well as perceived competition issues associated with asset managers managing stakes in multiple companies within certain industries, known as “common ownership”. The commentators argue that index funds have the potential to distort investment flows, create stock price bubbles, or conversely, exacerbate a decline in market prices.",0,2
"Compliance risk Compliance risk is the risk of failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, and in so doing, exposing the group to penalties and reputational damage. Penalties received or due for non-compliance are an example of this risk. As a leading financial services group, the group faces complex challenges to ensure that its activities comply with local legislation, regulations and supervisory requirements and the relevant international standards and requirements.",0,3
"Reputation Risk: This is the risk of loss of credibility due to internal or external factors and is often related to, or results from, other categories of risk. This risk can arise from our internal business practices or those of our business partners or the companies in which we invest. Business partners include third parties hired to perform some of our administrative functions as well as investment organizations with which we have a contractual arrangement. A loss of reputation could impact our position as a partner, investor and employer of choice and impede our ability to execute our strategy.",0,2
"The inability to reform mortgage markets has dramatically reduced mortgage availability. In fact, our analysis shows that, conservatively, more than $1 trillion in additional mortgage loans might have been made over a five-year period had we reformed our mortgage system. J.P. Morgan analysis indicates that the cost of not reforming the mortgage markets could be as high as 0.2% of GDP a year.",0,2
"The types of events that give rise to reputation risk are broad and could be introduced in various ways, including by the Firm’s employees and the clients, customers and counterparties with which the Firm does business. These events could result in financial losses, litigation and regulatory fines, as well as other damages to the Firm. As reputation risk is inherently difficult to identify, manage, and quantify, an independent reputation risk management governance function is critical.",0,3
"For our stakeholders: for customers, breaches in security may cause personal loss (both financial and emotional). There may also be consequences for relations with suppliers and intermediaries. For investors, any loss of business or reputation could result in lower returns. PSD2 will increase consumers’ control over financial data, but also their responsibility for this data.",0,2
"International political, social and economic risks Equinor has international interests located in regions where political, social and economic instability could adversely affect Equinor’s business. Equinor has assets and operations located in diverse regions globally where potentially negative economic, social, and political developments could occur. These political risks and security threats require continuous monitoring. Uncertainty exists around the UK`s exit from the EU and the potential market impact.",0,2
"In April 2018, the Group successfully completed a refinancing to convert floating to fixed debt and to extend the debt maturity out to November 2025. The Group issued a US$300 million bond with a fixed interest rate of 6.625%, which was swapped back to sterling upon issuance at an effective interest rate of 5%. The proceeds of the new issue were used to repay in full the £200 million floating rate bond issued in 2017 which had a maturity of 2022.",0,1
"IFC expands the availability of such technologies by channeling investments toward private companies that build modern communications infrastructure and information-technology businesses. In FY18, we invested $376 million in initiatives related to technology, including funds mobilized from other investors — expanding our portfolio in this sector to more than $2.4 billion.",0,1
"Our offerings are designed to meet the specific needs of IFC clients in different industries — with a special focus on infrastructure, manufacturing, agribusiness, services, and financial markets. In FY18, we made $11.6 billion in long-term investments in 366 projects. In addition, we mobilized nearly $11.7 billion to support the private sector in developing countries.",0,1
"JPMorgan Chase believes that companies must do even more to help solve today’s biggest challenges and create economic opportunity for more people. To do so, they must invest in communities the same way they invest in their own businesses. As announced in early 2018, our firm will deploy $1.75 billion by 2023 to drive inclusive growth in communities around the world. Generating Return on Community is one of our core objectives because we know that the future of our company depends on the well-being of our communities.",0,2

"Through these initiatives, Konica Minolta is aiming to achieve the business targets of more than ¥75 billion in operating profit, ¥50 billion in profit attributable to owners of the company, and ROE of 9.5% by fiscal 2019, the final year of the Medium Term Business Plan. Beyond this, we are looking to achieve a medium-term target of more than ¥100 billion in operating profit and more than ¥70 billion in profit attributable to owners of the company by fiscal 2021.",0,1
" For asset management companies belonging to a Group (most of the tested sample), inadequate internal supervision of the services (relating to IT, cybersecurity and business continuity) performed by the parent company was identified. But the technical execution of these services by the Group cannot exempt asset management companies from their responsibilities regarding the definition (in priority) of the main risk areas and management of the relevant controls.",0,2
CORPORATE AND HOUSEHOLD DEBT 25 carried out a benchmark study of the banks’ calculated risk weights for exposures to commercial real estate. The results of the two analyses showed that there is a risk that the capital banks have earmarked for lending to commercial real estate will not sufficiently compensate for the credit losses that could arise following a severe financial stress. It is against this background that FI proposes higher capital requirements for lending to commercial real estate (see “Stability in the banking sector”).,0,3
"Reputational risk In 2019 and in recent years, there has continued to be a range of material risk events such as service outages and data compromises in the market. These impact the reputation of the financial services industry as a whole and potentially threaten consumer confidence in both the reliability of services and the safety of their data and savings.",0,2
"Operational risks are inherent in the Barclays Bank Group’s business activities and it is not cost effective or possible to attempt to eliminate all operational risks. The Operational Risk Framework is therefore focused on identifying operational risks, assessing them and managing them within the Barclays Bank Group’s approved risk appetite.",0,3
"We have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management capabilities and expect to continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, our risk management strategies, models and processes, including our use of various risk models for assessing market exposures and hedging strategies, stress testing and other analysis, may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated.",0,3
"Disappointingly, the vast majority of companies only make generic references to emerging risks when describing their risk management processes. They provide little insight into whether existing risk management processes were sufficient to identify emerging risks or whether they had to flex or amend these processes to do so. They give little information about how emerging risks, once identified, are treated and monitored.",0,3
"Compliance Risk Management Compliance risk (a type of operational risk) is the risk resulting from the failure to comply with laws (legislation, regulations and rules) and regulatory guidance, and the failure to appropriately address associated impacts, including to customers. Compliance risk encompasses violations of applicable internal policies, program requirements, procedures, and standards related to ethical principles applicable to the banking industry.",0,3
"Creating value Measuring our reputation KPI FY19 FY18 FY17 FY16 FY15 AGL‘s Reptrak score declined since FY18. The drop in AGL‘s reputation over the past year has been driven by declining scores on three important dimensions of reputation – leadership, workplace and citizenship. This decline in reputation was consistent with scores across the energy industry as a whole.",0,1
"Given the significant impact of this period of uncertainty on both Canadian businesses and companies and governments around the world, and the resulting volatility in financial markets, we expect to see significant effects on several of our financial statement line items and on our financial results in 2020. The timing and size of those impacts is not possible to forecast at this time.",0,2
"The quantitative investment strategies focus mainly on stock picking based on quality and valuation. It is precisely these strategies, which yield long-term value and are suitable for large portfolios, that tend to perform poorly in a context of highly accommodative central bank monetary policies. In 2019, all major quantitative investment styles performed poorly; stock picking based on valuation and quality and stock picking based on recent price trends both yielded negative returns. This combination is seldom seen.",0,3
Risks to the Group’s reputation Risks include acts or omissions by the Group or any of its employees that could damage the Group’s reputation or lead to a loss of trust among its stakeholders. Every risk type has potential consequences for Zurich’s reputation. Effectively managing each risk type supports preventing adverse reputation outcomes.,0,2
"We may be subject to unionization, work stoppages, slowdowns or increased labor costs and the unionization of the Company’s pilots and inflight crewmembers could result in increased labor costs. Our business is labor intensive and the unionization of any of our crewmembers could result in demands that may increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Any of the different crafts or classes of our crewmembers could unionize at any time, which would require us to negotiate in good faith with the crewmember group’s certified representative concerning a collective bargaining agreement. In addition, we may be subject to disruptions by unions protesting the non-union status of our other crewmembers. Any of these events would be disruptive to our operations and could harm our business.",0,2
"If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel or fail to maintain our company culture, our business could be harmed. We compete against other major U.S. airlines for pilots, mechanics, and other skilled labor; some of them offer wage and benefit packages exceeding ours. As more pilots in the industry approach mandatory retirement age, the U.S. airline industry may be affected by a pilot shortage. We may be required to increase wages and/or benefits in order to attract and retain qualified personnel or risk considerable crewmember turnover. If we are unable to hire, train, and retain qualified crewmembers, our business could be harmed and we may be unable to implement our growth plans.",0,2
"Operational risks Operational risks relate to the losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or due to external events. These risks normally fall within our low-risk appetite level as there is no strategic benefit from accepting the risk and accepting that it is not in line with our vision and values.",0,2
"Reputation: In managing our reputation we seek to avoid the loss of credibility due to internal or external factors. Many types of risk have the potential to negatively impact our corporate reputation. Internal business practices, or those of our business partners or the companies in which we invest, may generate reputation harm. Consequences include diminished brand efficacy in commercial markets, impeding our ability to execute our strategy and our status as investor, partner and employer of choice.",0,2
"In addition, our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving. We may fail to fully understand the implications of changes in our businesses or the financial markets or fail to adequately or timely enhance our risk framework to address those changes. If our risk framework is ineffective because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets, regulatory requirements, our businesses, our counterparties, clients or service providers or for other reasons, we could incur losses, suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations.",0,2
"Although we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies, procedures and methods, including with respect to market, credit, liquidity, operational as well as reputational and model risk, they may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposures in all economic market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that we fail to identify or anticipate.",0,3
"The enterprise risks were categorized as an external, operational or strategic risk. External risks emerge from outside the organization, operational risks arise from within the organization, and strategic risks are associated with our strategic initiatives. The identified risks can significantly affect the Association’s finance, relevancy and reputation if mitigations are not in place.",0,2
"Given how essential bonds are to the global economy — as a source of risk management and returns for investors, as a source of capital for companies and governments — the lack of structural innovations to the bond market for many years was surprising. For decades, bond markets largely stayed the same. And in fact, investing in bonds became more difficult following the global financial crisis, as greater regulatory oversight and capital restrictions significantly reduced banks’ balance sheets and as a result, bond inventories.",0,2
"IAG is exposed to multiple risks relating to its general insurance business. The risks noted below are not meant to represent an exhaustive list, but outline the material risks faced by the Group as identified in the RMS:  strategic risk – the risk that internal or external factors compromise our ability to execute our strategic objectives or our strategy;",0,2
"We could suffer losses and our business has been and could be adversely affected by the failure to adopt and implement effective risk management We have implemented risk management strategies, policies and internal controls involving processes and procedures intended to identify, monitor and manage risks facing the Group. However, our risk management framework has not always been, or may not in the future prove to be, effective.",0,2
"Regulatory compliance can divert management attention and increase capacity needed to make changes to comply, thereby reducing the aptitude to pursue strategic objectives. It often tends to increase the size of risk, compliance and assurance functions which monitor, maintain and report on compliance. Regulatory compliance can introduce complexity and inefficiencies into ordinary business processes, which drive up cost and impact customers who do not always appreciate the value of regulations.",0,2
"1.4.2 Health, safety and security of employees and subcontractors Health and safety Employees of VINCI companies and subcontracting companies are required to work on the increasingly complex projects and operations that the Group carries out. This can threaten their health, safety, hygiene and the quality of their life at work. The health and safety coordinators of the Group’s business lines have identified several types of risk considered as major (see the column “Identifying risks” in the table below).",0,2
"Impacts of Risks are consequences of risks, both quantitative and qualitative. There may be many consequences of risks manifesting, such as a reduction in earnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and fines or penalties, or qualitative impacts such as reputation damage, loss of clients and customers, and regulatory and enforcement actions.",0,2
"Operational risk involves the risk of a positive, negative or potential loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, human behaviour and systems or from external incidents. Business continuity risk, financial reporting risk, model risk and HR risk are within the scope of the Group’s operational risk management. Operational incidents and losses in all (risk) areas are recorded in the Operational Incident Database.",0,3
"Data: Advancements in new technologies and new services, an increasing external threat landscape, and changing regulatory requirements increase the need for the Group to effectively govern, manage, and protect its data (or the data shared with third-party suppliers).

"Capitalization of Inventory Costs We capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval, when, based on management’s judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. We consider numerous attributes in evaluating whether the costs to manufacture a particular product should be capitalized as an asset. We assess the regulatory approval process and where the particular product stands in relation to that approval process, including any known safety or efficacy concerns, potential labeling restrictions and other impediments to approval. We evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints relating to the product and the indication in which it will be used. We consider our manufacturing environment including our supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could hamper approval or commercialization. We consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or delay commercialization. We also base our judgment on the viability of commercialization, trends in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria. Finally, we consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to realize. We expense previously capitalized costs related to pre-approval inventory upon a change in such judgment, due to, among other potential factors, a denial or significant delay of approval by necessary regulatory bodies.",0,3

"In light of the dynamism of domestic demand, the surplus of the foreign sector is deteriorating due to the deceleration of the world economy and the global climate of increased uncertainty. Thus, foreign demand will probably maintain a more moderate contribution to growth, while these forces continue to influence the foreign environment.",0,2
"In this context, in the first half of the year the world economy has progressed at a slower pace (estimated 3.2%, compared to 3.5% in the second half of 2018), burdened by increased financial volatility and deteriorated confidence due to trade tensions. This comes in addition to a succession of idiosyncratic elements in key advanced economies (particularly in Europe). Nonetheless, in this less favourable environment, the growth figures of the main international economies are reasonably good. Thus, among the emerging economies, China showed favourable growth data (6.4% in the first quarter of 2019, the same figure as in the fourth quarter of 2018). This contrasts with various indicators, especially those related to exports, imports and manufacturing production, which imply that the climate of trade tensions has eroded the performance of external and industrial sectors. However, this burden has been offset by various stimulus measures implemented by the authorities in the fields of tax and monetary policies.",0,1

"The Dom Pérignon vintages are unique because of how they evolve. They do not mature in a linear fashion, but in a series of stages, producing windows of expression. We refer to these special moments as “Plénitudes”. They are instants when the wine reveals itself with greater intensity. P2, Dom Pérignon’s Second Plénitude, is the result of at least sixteen years of elaboration. This name reflects the wine’s character. At its peak, P2 is dynamic and bursting with energy, revealing an abundance of aromas on the palate. Dom Pérignon’s dark, mineral, iodic, spicy personality resonates with more intensity and clarity than ever.",0,3
"The conviction that “people make the difference” runs deep in our Group, and we see training as a vital tool – not only for helping each of our employees fulfill their professional aspirations, but also for meeting our busi- ness objectives. To satisfy this dual imperative, we have put in place a wide-ranging training program that operates at Group level, within the Maisons, and also regionally. Courses cover a broad spectrum, including skills upgrading, cultural adaptation, management and business challenges, and are tailored to suit different levels of responsibility.",0,4

"Finally, in 2020, an internal communication initiative entitled #proudtobediasorin took place, involving the whole Group. Through the company’s commitment in the fight against the pandemic and the experiences of the families of DiaSorin employees around the world, the project helped to keep up our people’s morale, strengthened the sense of belonging. An example of employee involvement in #proudtobediasorin was the collection of drawings by Group’s employees’ children, representing their parents at work during the first pandemic wave. The drawings gathered from employees around the world were assembled in a video available on the Group’s website showing, through the eyes of children, what each employee has done to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic.",0,2
"Subsidiaries are companies over which the Group is able to exercise control pursuant to IFRS 10, that is when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.

"Again, with reference to the COVID Projects, the Company launched two additional molecular diagnostic tests: the Simplexa COVID-19 Direct Kit and Simplexa Flu A / B & RSV Direct Gen II. The first allows to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 from nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva samples (only in markets accepting CE marking). The latter detects Influenza A and B strains and the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), allowing differential diagnosis of these infections and SARS-CoV-2. Both tests have been approved in countries accepting CE marking and have received FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the U.S market.",0,2
"Collectively, these activities revealed some uncomfortable truths about the way our society and parts of our industry operate.

"Women’s empowerment, an essential factor to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth We share the G20 leaders’ view that “Gender equality and women’s empowerment are essential for achieving sustainable and inclusive economic growth.” In Japan, if the securities industry, which employs about 90,000 executives and employees, endeavors to promote working reforms, enhance productivity, and become an environment conductive to a diverse range of human capital, it has the potential to contribute greatly to improvement of working conditions as a whole. With this in mind, the JSDA has conducted a number of initiatives starting with the survey to grasp the current status of working conditions in the industry. The survey revealed some current challenges to gender equality in the workplace, such as the lack of female workers at managerial level, lack of diverse role models, and the unconscious bias among workers. To address these challenges, the JSDA began a series of measures including: • Establishing the “Women’s Network” for the securities industry • Signing the Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEPs) *See Page 9 for details",0,4

"Diamond and gemstone sourcing Diamonds are only purchased from the few suppliers who completely respect and implement the Kimberley Process certifi- cation system. Certification guarantees that diamonds can be proven to originate from conflict-free regions and from legal trade. Countries, companies, and merchants who do not use this certification system in its entirety are excluded from trade. In addition, only long-term partners who comply with the CIBJO (Confédération Internationale de la Bijouterie, Joaillerie, Orfèvrerie des diamants, perles, et pierres; The World Jewellery Confedera- tion) guidelines as well as the Kimberley Process are used, in or- der to eliminate any quality and sourcing risks.",0,3
" At the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018, the economic environment and prospects for the watchmaking industry were improved and Swatch Group was able to meet the high demands of the different markets. This was made possible by employees who not only remained active during the difficult months but also used the time available to acquire new skills and thus meet the challenges facing Swatch Group. It was important to maintain a good and open relationship with the staff, who acknowledged the efforts made by their em- ployers to maintain the positions as well as the general condi- tions required for each person’s personal fulfillment.",0,2
"The production capacity of integrated watch modules was increased during the year under review. These modules are used, for example, in the manufacture of Longines V.H.P. (Very High Precision) watches. At the same time, developments with miniature real-time clocks, as well as experience gained in this field, are helping Micro Crystal to significantly increase the accuracy of its integrated watch modules. The integration of quartz and an integrated circuit in the same package, along with temperature compensation and other environmental influences, will soon enable Swatch Group brands to produce even more accurate quartz watches. The improved miniature integrated watch modules have extremely low power consumption, which guar- antees long watch battery life. This progress in development was only possible thanks to the close cooperation between Micro Crystal and its sister companies EM Microelectronic and ETA Manufacture Horlogère Suisse.",0,3
"Wood, the building’s leitmotif, is omnipresent, including a symbolic representation with five trees that create a distinctive atmosphere in various parts of the building: Bucida buceras are black olive trees originally native to tropical regions and which can grow to heights of up to two stories. These exotic visitors were chosen because their fine evergreen foliage copes well with room temperatures. The fourth and smallest floor by sur- face area stretches under the vaulted ceiling of the unusual wooden façade. Here, visitors are closer to the “skin of the build- ing” than anywhere else.",0,2
"Villeret Métiers d’Art Binchōtan Through its Métiers d’Art collection, Blancpain innovates by combining the know-how of its craftsmen with ancestral decora- tive techniques rarely used in watchmaking. In 2018, the Maison presented its first dials in binchōtan, a charcoal of remarkable quality because it is extremely dense, resulting from the slow combustion of ubamegashi wood in a clay furnace heated to around 1300 degrees Celsius. The sudden rise in temperature, followed by rapid cooling, reduces the bark of the tree to ashes and gives way to a smooth surface with a hardness comparable to that of steel. Blancpain has acquired this 17th century Japa- nese skill to create a series of unique dials.",0,1
"Educating employees about the Kirin Group’s approach to business In February 2019, the Group formulated the Kirin Group Vision 2027 as a long-term management vision with the goal of being a global leader in creating shared value (CSV). It also created a new mission statement to express its basic management concept of creating new value for stakeholders in and outside the Group. Finally, the Group created a new corporate slogan, “Joy brings us together,” to simply convey its fundamental business approach to customers and the public. On the momentum of these initiatives, all members of the Kirin Group—numbering 31,040 worldwide—are set to put the concept of CSV into practice while striving for sustainable growth.",0,2
The Group created a special team to examine potential uses for its yeast production and other technologies for health food products and to apply its technologies and expertise in the beer brewing and beverage businesses to the health domain. R&D led to the discovery in 2011 of Lactococcus lactis strain Plasma that was commercialized as iMUSE brand products.,0,2
"Corporate governance is another area where we recognize that further fortification is essential. Regarding oversight, we have added new independent non-executive directors who are experts in their fields to assist specialization. The resulting significant increase in the ratio of non-executive directors to all directors is conducive to objective discussion. We are also adding more incentives to executive compensation to drive stronger medium- to long-term performance and increased corporate value. By tracking progress toward CSV non-financial targets in addition to financial targets we are further reinforcing our commitment to CSV management. Regarding execution, we have clarified responsibilities by enhancing our research and development system and establishing the Health Business Strategy Office.",0,4
"Through our joint-research, we have discovered how proteins that improve skin conditions can be increasingly activated by 14-dehydroergosterol (14-DHE), a compound contained in a white koji mold produced by the Kirin Group. FANCL will examine how 14-DHE’s properties that prevent skin aging can be applied in a wide range of products, including cosmetics and sunscreen. FANCL also plans to use 14-DHE in its mainstay cosmetics when its product lineup is renewed in 2021.",0,2
"In Japan’s soft drink market, sales of canned coffee have been on the decline in recent years. For Kirin Beverage, decreased sales of canned coffee products were having a relatively large impact on performance because these products are highly profitable. It was able to compensate for these results with growing sales of other products, but finding a way to halt the falling sales of FIRE became a serious issue. Compared with beer brands, devising medium- to long-term marketing strategies for soft drink brands is more difficult as the cycle of releasing new products and renewing existing brands is much faster. Kirin Beverage had been implementing a short-term cycle, as conventionally done by soft drink makers in Japan, but due to the impact of the downward trend in the market, its marketing campaigns were less and less successful. Therefore, in the autumn of 2019, Kirin Beverage adopted Kirin Brewery’s marketing methods to renew FIRE in an effort to restart the brand’s sales growth.",0,2

"IBM has been an industry leader in releasing numerous public policy positions with concrete, actionable recommendations regarding the development, regulation and ethical use of AI. For example, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna’s letter to the US Congress in June 2020 said that IBM “firmly opposes and will not condone uses of any technology, including facial recognition technology offered by other vendors, for mass surveillance, racial profiling, or violations of basic human rights and freedoms.” In September, IBM called for facial recognition to be included in America’s list of export-controlled technologies, recognizing its potential use “to suppress dissent, to infringe on the rights of minorities, or to erase basic expectations of privacy.” Learn more about IBM’s AI-related positions at THINKPolicy.",0,3

"To sustainably develop operational activities that are capable of flexibly responding to customer diversity, product diversity and the globally expanding market, we acknowledge that adequate risk-taking and decisive decision-making are necessary. We also place importance on multilaterally understanding and appropriately overseeing issues and risks associated with the implementation of management strategies. We believe it is effective to structure a corporate governance system consisting of the Board of Directors, made up of Directors of the Company who are familiar with the Company’s customer characteristics, products, business operations and functions and Outside Directors who have a wealth of knowledge in global corporate management, and the Audit & Supervisory Board whose members include Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members with professional knowledge in areas including accounting, legal affairs, and management administration. Under this corporate governance system, Executive Officers are appointed to execute operational duties in a timely manner, and the Board of Directors delegates matters related to the execution of business operations to the Executive Officers.",0,4
"Net non-operating income was positive in the amount of ¥4.8 billion, which was ¥5.2 billion, or 52.2%, lower than in the previous year.

"Forecast for Fiscal 2016 The Company’s demand forecast for major businesses in 2016 is for continued solid macroeconomic conditions in developed markets, but with uncertainty continuing in emerging markets due to declining resource prices and weaker currencies in countries like Indonesia and Brazil. Given these expectations, the Company plans to increase the earnings power of all its businesses. This will be achieved by further developing the market for platform models in the motorcycle business, leveraging the strength of the brand to maintain high profitability in the marine products business, and strengthening the sports segment for ROVs in the power products business. These earnings will then be invested to facilitate lasting growth, with the aim of evolving into “a unique company that continues to achieve dynamic milestones.”",0,2
"A weakening of the global economic envi- ronment could result in a deterioration of the market environment and the competi- tive situation in the industry. In particular, a stronger than anticipated decline or a prolonged weakness of the construc- tion market could result in a significant decline in the new equipment market and a more challenging market environment for services. In particular, a sustained mar- ket decline in China, which accounts for approximately 30% of KONE’s sales, could have an adverse effect on KONE’s growth and profitability.",0,2
"Customer credit risks relate to advance payments receivable from customers or to accounts receivable related to equipment handed over or to services rendered. This risk is managed by defining the rules for tendering, payment terms, authorizations and credit control as well as project man- agement controls. Advance payments, documentary credits and guarantees are used in payment terms to minimize customer credit risks. KONE proactively manages its accounts receivable in order to minimize the risk of customer defaults.",0,3

"As a result of travel restrictions arising from the current global pandemic, we were unable to carry out our assurance activities as originally planned and agreed with Gold Fields. In-person visits to operations and the head office were replaced with remote reviews via teleconference and video calls for this year’s assurance engagement. While we believe these changes do not affect our reasonable assurance opinions above, we draw attention to the possibility that if we had undertaken in-person visits we may have identified errors and omissions in the assured information that we did not discover through the alternative approach.",0,3
"After a difficult 2018, in which we undertook a significant restructuring process, which resulted in reducing our workforce by a third, South Deep can now report material and steady progress towards sustainable growth. With costs cut by 31% and production up by over 40%, South Deep stemmed its decade- long cash burn in 2019 and contributed US$15m in net cash compared to an outflow of US$146m in 2018. As significant, the leadership team has managed to facilitate a new culture of performance at the mine, as exemplified by a 30% improvement in employee and fleet productivity. It truly is remarkable progress, and we are cautiously optimistic about further entrenching these developments during 2020.",0,1
"In addition to the international standards and guidelines with which we voluntarily align (detailed on p03 of our AFR), we are committed to entrenching the principles of King IV throughout our business. The application of King IV within Gold Fields can be found in our full Corporate Governance Report (p14 – 16 of our AFR).",0,2
"In our view, capital expenditure in the industry has to increase, with companies needing to spend on new projects and exploration to maintain production levels.
