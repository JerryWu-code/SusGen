We prioritize risks based on their impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being part of this process.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is interviewed to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption.

Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. The time horizon for assessment is typically three years, but we also monitor emerging risks and opportunities beyond three years up to a century using our long-term forward-looking ERM radar feature. Assessment is based on impact and velocity."}

Include an analysis of the financial implications, potential scenarios, and the strategic fit into the organization's overall business strategy. Focus on how these factors influence operational planning, investment strategies, and innovation initiatives.\nAnswer the following questions: \n1. Managing climate-related risk and opportunities\n", "input": "", "answer": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the U.S., Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our Siemens Water Tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."}

Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nThe collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the US, Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our water strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our Siemens Water Tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low, due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."}

The frameworks connect our risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system.\n\nOur risk management process aims for early identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially affect our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues in a timely manner.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on impact and likelihood, considering different perspectives, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizations mentioned. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. Our response strategies include avoidance, transfer, reduction, acceptance, and seizing opportunities. For each risk or opportunity, responsibility involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures are specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nOur company addresses various risks, including those related to economic activity and customer demand, project risks, and risks from the transmission of infectious agents. We closely monitor macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries to address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand. We maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure and avoid or minimize potential losses. We constantly check information from relevant institutions to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible."}

In a first step, assuming responsibility for a specific risk or opportunity involves choosing one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies with respect to risks are avoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance of the relevant risk. Our general response strategy with respect to opportunities is to \"seize\" the relevant opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures have to be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates by engaging in hedging activities. Regarding our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and complemented by clearly defined approval processes, assists us in identifying and responding to project risks at an early stage, even before the bidding phase. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential cases of damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure to such risks and to avoid or minimize potential losses.\n\nWe address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries and adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary.\n\nThere are worldwide risks from the transmission of infectious agents from animals to humans, from humans to humans, and in other ways. Epidemic, pandemic, or other spread patterns such as bioterrorism threaten to cause high disease rates in different countries, regions, or continents. We constantly check information from the World Health Organization (WHO), the American and European Centers for Disease Control, the German Robert Koch Institute, and other institutions to be able to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible."}

Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisation's businesses, strategy, and financial planning.\n", "input": "", "answer": "Following our ESG review, we have developed a new ESG Strategic Framework (the 'framework'). This framework is fully aligned to our business strategy and our purpose of helping people to get the most out of life, accumulate wealth, and save for their goals. The key features of our ESG framework include its three strategic pillars, which have clear alignment with our business strategy. Within each of these, specific differentiating focus areas have been identified where we believe our company can make a meaningful impact.\n\nWe believe that the new strategic ESG framework and the long-term goals to reduce carbon emissions and support an inclusive transition are an important way for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and fulfill our fiduciary obligations. It will help us manage risk over time, while also contributing to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Recognizing that transition risk represents the nearest-term and most impactful financial risk, we have conducted an initial analysis of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio. This analysis focused on investments where our company maintains control and exerts influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to the overall carbon footprint metrics of the asset book and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors. It also enables us to determine and monitor the most carbon-intensive companies held in the asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes of our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in markets with varying levels of development. Some markets have diversified, service-led economies and mature financial markets, while others are more dependent on primary and energy-intensive industries. These emerging markets have a greater reliance on fossil fuels in their generation mix and less developed financial systems. The energy transition across the region is likely to proceed at a slower pace than for advanced economies. This point was highlighted by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). Speaking at a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020, Mr. Menon noted that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are committed to an objective to reduce carbon emissions in our investment portfolio, we are mindful of the need to implement the strategy in a way that acknowledges the nature of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition in a fair manner. Our support for an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We recognize the importance of coalition building in delivering an inclusive transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we work with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group our company has co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to catalyze new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."}

This framework is fully aligned to our business strategy and our purpose of helping people get the most out of life by making healthcare accessible and affordable, helping people accumulate wealth through growing their assets, and empowering our customers to save for their goals.\n\nWe have identified three strategic pillars within our ESG framework, which have clear alignment with our business strategy. Within each of these, specific differentiating focus areas have been identified where we believe our company can make a meaningful impact. We will place greater focus on these differentiators.\n\nOur new strategic ESG framework and the long-term goals to decarbonise our investment portfolio and support an inclusive transition are an important way for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and fulfill our fiduciary obligations. It will reduce our exposure to asset risk \u2013 which includes transition risk \u2013 over time, while also contributing to efforts to decarbonise the global economy. Recognising that transition risk represents the nearest-term and most impactful financial risk to our company, we have conducted an initial transition risk analysis on investments where we maintain direct control and exert influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to the overall carbon footprint metrics of our investment portfolio and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded. It also enables us to determine and monitor the most carbon-intensive companies held in our investment portfolio. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes of our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in various markets, including highly developed economies with diversified, service-led economies and mature financial markets, and emerging markets that are more dependent on primary and energy-intensive industries. These emerging markets have a greater reliance on fossil fuels in their generation mix and less developed financial systems. The energy transition across the region is likely to proceed at a slower pace than for advanced economies.\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are committed to an objective to decarbonise our investment portfolio, we are mindful of the need to implement the strategy in a way that acknowledges the nature of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition in a fair manner. Our support for an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders.\n\nWe recognise the importance of coalition building in delivering an inclusive transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), we work with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group our company has co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to catalyse new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."}

Due to challenges in data sourcing and processes, there have been impacts on certain climate disclosures.\n\nClimate scenario analysis is used as a risk assessment tool to provide insights on the long-term effects of transition and physical risks across our corporate and retail banking portfolios, as well as our own operations. Our sustainable finance ambition enables sustainable infrastructure and energy systems, promotes decarbonisation efforts across the real economy, and enhances investor capital through sustainable investment.\n\nWe aim to achieve net zero in our financed emissions by 2050 and in our own operations and supply chain by 2030. We aim to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn of sustainable finance and investment for our customers in their transition to net zero and a sustainable future.\n\nOur assessment of climate risks covers three distinct time periods: short term (up to 2025), medium term (2026 to 2035), and long term (2036 to 2050). Transition or physical climate-related issues identified are assessed using enhanced questionnaires and scoring tools.\n\nWe support our customers in their transition through our sustainable finance and investment ambition. Our sustainable finance data dictionary includes a detailed definition of contributing activities.\n\nCertain perils, such as coastal, river, and surface water flooding, drive potential credit losses in our retail portfolio. Around 20% of our financed properties are in London, and most are protected by the Thames Barrier.\n\nWe identified six key sectors with the highest exposure to climate transition risk: automotive, chemicals, construction and building materials, metals and mining, oil and gas, and power and utilities. We continued to improve our identification and assessment of climate risk within our retail mortgage portfolio, with increased investments in physical risk data and enhancements to our internal risk assessment capabilities and models.\n\nOpportunities include sustainable finance, sustainable investment, and sustainable infrastructure. For a detailed breakdown of our sustainable finance progress by geography, see the ESG Data Pack.\n\nWe report our exposure to high transition risk sectors in our wholesale portfolio. Since 2020, we have rolled out the questionnaire to include our largest customers in the next highest climate transition risk sectors: agriculture, industrials, real estate, and transportation.\n\nAs a result of climate scenario analysis, our largest and most impacted sectors \u2013 power and utilities, construction and building materials, and chemicals \u2013 are subject to increased levels of transition risks. Our asset management division is increasingly considering both physical and transition risks and integrating ESG and climate analysis into the investment decision-making process.\n\nTransition to net zero represents one of our strategic pillars. We aim to be net zero in our operations and supply chain by 2030 and in our financed emissions by 2050. Scenario analysis supports our strategy by assessing our position under a range of climate scenarios and helping us plan for the future and meet growing regulatory requirements.\n\nWe continue to develop our climate scenario analysis exercises to have a more comprehensive understanding of climate headwinds, risks, and opportunities that will support our strategic planning and actions. We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of climate-related issues on financial planning, particularly the impact on financial performance and financial position. We expect to further enhance our disclosure and processes in relation to acquisitions/divestments in the medium term.\n\nClimate change poses a physical risk to the buildings we occupy as an organization, including offices, retail branches, and data centers. We use stress testing to evaluate the potential impact to our owned or leased premises. Our scenario stress test, conducted in 2022, analyzed how seven different climate change-related hazards could impact 500 of our critical and important buildings.\n\nOur Climate Solutions Partnership is a philanthropic initiative that aims to identify and remove barriers to scale for climate change solutions. We support start-up companies developing carbon-cutting technologies, nature-based solutions, renewable energy initiatives in Asia, and the WWF-led Asia Sustainable Palm Oil Links programme.\n\nDuring Board meetings, we balance discussions on the company's performance, emerging risks, and duties to shareholders while remaining conscious of responsibilities to support communities and help customers. In 2022, the Board approved an update to the thermal coal phase-out policy and the publication of an updated energy policy. We have committed to publishing our own climate transition plan in 2023."}

It helps to build our awareness of climate change, plan for the future and meet our growing regulatory requirements. \u2013 In 2022, we conducted our first internal climate scenario analysis exercise where we used four scenarios to represent the range of potential outcomes for global climate change. The analysis considered the key regions where we operate and assessed the impact on our balance sheet between the 2022 and 2050 time period. Key drivers of performance and how they were taken into account \u2013 Climate scenario analysis enables us to model how different potential climate pathways may impact our customers and portfolios, particularly in terms of credit losses. Under the Current Commitments scenario, we anticipate moderate levels of losses related to transition risks. However, the rise in global warming will lead to increasing levels of physical risk losses in later years.\n\nScenarios used and how they factored in government policies \u2013 The scenario assumptions for our climate stress testing exercise include varying levels of governmental climate policy changes, macroeconomic factors, and technological developments. However, these scenarios depend on the development of technologies that are still uncertain, such as global hydrogen production to decarbonize aviation and shipping. For details of the assumptions, see the ESG Data Pack.\n\nHow our strategies may change and adapt \u2013 The nature of the scenarios, our evolving capabilities, and the limitations of the analysis result in indicative outcomes of climate change headwinds, although they are not a direct forecast. \u2013 Developments in climate science, data, methodology, and scenario analysis techniques will help us refine our approach further. We therefore expect this view of risk to evolve over time. \u2013 We intend to continue to strengthen our capabilities for climate scenario analysis and use the results for decision making, particularly in respect of strategy, by utilizing the range of scenario analysis outcomes to shape our strategy across business and regions. \u2013 We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of transition and physical risk quantitatively, due to transitional challenges including data limitations and evolving science and methodologies."}
