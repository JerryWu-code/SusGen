Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being part of this process.\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is consulted to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with global climate agreements to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In situations where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the production of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For instance, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where feasible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, our reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."}

Describe the organization\u2019s processes for identifying and assessing climate- related risks \n Describe the organization\u2019s processes for managing climaterelated risks \n Elaborate on the incorporation of the company's procedures for pinpointing, evaluating, and handling climate-related risks into its comprehensive risk management strategy.\n", "answer": "Our Company's Direct Operations:\nRisk management is an essential process in our organization, encompassing all functions. We evaluate risks related to financial and market performance, operational efficiency, emergency preparedness and response, environmental compliance, and health and safety. We prioritize risks based on their potential impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers, as well as regulatory requirements. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments evaluate domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. Additionally, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have reviewed potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high-intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. We have considered raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management discusses which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success. We also consult external stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. ISO 14001 defines an environmental aspect as an element of an organization's activities, products, or services that has or may have an impact on the environment. Our significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system. Each environmental aspect, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, is ranked from 0 through 4 based on criteria like severity, magnitude, probability, frequency, controllability, duration, employee concerns, community concerns, boundaries, business impact, and regulatory. The highest scores identify our significant impacts, which we focus on in more detail in our environmental management systems.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our suppliers of raw materials. As a global organization, we rely on various suppliers for raw materials, some of which may be subject to supply constraints due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the production of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."}

{"instruction": "Prepared to offer guidance on risk management strategies, given my proficiency in the TCFD framework.", "input": "Answer the following questions: \n1. Managing climate-related risk and opportunities\n", "answer": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a benchmark year. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nTogether with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in a certain country has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the rainy season, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."}

This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our water strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in a certain country has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the rainy season, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low, due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."}

Addressing and leveraging climate-related risks and opportunities\n", "answer": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a benchmark year. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed.

Our internal auditors regularly evaluate the sufficiency and efficiency of our risk management, and any shortcomings can be remedied through suitable measures.\n\nOur risk management strategy is all-encompassing, dynamic, and management-focused, and is embedded within our organization. It deals with both risks and opportunities. Our strategy is grounded in globally recognized standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO 31000, and is customized to our company's specifications. The frameworks link our risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system.\n\nOur risk management process targets the early identification and assessment of risks and opportunities that could materially impact our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is generally three years, and we employ a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities that remain after the implementation of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a systematic manner, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting typically follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to expeditiously address critical issues.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on impact and probability, taking into account various viewpoints, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down aspect ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at various management levels and are incorporated into the subsequent reporting process, if deemed relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are consolidated within and for each of the departments mentioned. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. Our response strategies encompass avoidance, transfer, reduction, acceptance, and capitalizing on opportunities. For each risk or opportunity, responsibility entails the development, initiation, and monitoring of suitable response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures are specifically designed to enable effective risk management.\n\nOur company manages various risks, including those related to economic conditions and customer demand, project risks, and risks from the transmission of infectious agents. We closely monitor macroeconomic trends and developments in relevant industries to address the risk of economic instability and shifting customer demand.

Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. The first step in assuming responsibility for a risk or opportunity involves selecting one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies for risks include avoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance. Our general response strategy for opportunities is to \"seize\" the opportunity. In the second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures must be tailored to enable effective risk management.\n\nWe have developed various response measures with distinct characteristics. For instance, we mitigate the risk of currency and interest rate fluctuations through hedging activities. In managing our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, provisional acceptances during project execution, and clearly defined approval processes helps us identify and respond to project risks early, even before the bidding phase. Additionally, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential damage and liability risks to minimize our exposure to such risks and avoid or mitigate potential losses.\n\nWe address the risk of economic activity and customer demand fluctuations by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries and adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures as necessary.\n\nGlobal risks include the transmission of infectious agents from animals to humans, from humans to humans, and in other ways. Epidemics, pandemics, or other spread patterns, such as bioterrorism, pose a threat to causing high disease rates in different countries, regions, or continents. We continually monitor information from the World Health Organization (WHO), the American and European Centers for Disease Control, the German Robert Koch Institute, and other institutions to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible."}

The Board recognizes the importance of senior executive involvement and holistic oversight of ESG matters that are material to our organization. In 2020, a Group ESG Committee was established to provide this oversight. The Committee is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and includes senior representatives from various business units and functional areas, such as the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, the HR Director, and representatives from our business units. One of the Group ESG Committee's responsibilities is to oversee our progress towards fulfilling our commitment to report against the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In 2020, the Group ESG Committee reported to the Board through the Nomination & Governance Committee.\n\nThe Board acknowledges that the next 12 to 18 months are critical for the implementation of our ESG Strategic Framework and related matters, such as the development and embedding of our purpose and values, diversity and inclusion (D&I) priorities, and employee engagement activities. In early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight during this period.\n\nOur policies and procedures for managing ESG issues are outlined in our Group Governance Manual (GGM). The GGM is subject to an annual formal content review, taking into consideration internal and external factors. Any instances of GGM non-compliance identified through annual attestations are assessed by policy owners and reported to the Group Audit Committee.\n\nOur company believes that our new strategic ESG framework and long-term goals to decarbonize our investment portfolio and support an inclusive transition are essential for meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary obligations. This approach will reduce our exposure to asset risk, including transition risk, over time, while also contributing to global decarbonization efforts. Our Risk function conducted an initial transition risk analysis on insurance assets managed in segregated portfolios by our asset managers. This analysis focused on investments where we maintain direct control and exert influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to our overall carbon footprint metrics and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded. It also enables the identification and monitoring of the most carbon-intensive companies held in our asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of our listed equity and corporate bond asset classes.\n\nThe Board's oversight of climate change risk has been significantly strengthened. In 2020, ESG was overseen by the Board through the Nomination & Governance Committee. In early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established until May 2022 to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight of ESG matters (including climate change). A Board Risk Committee workshop was held to evaluate the climate change risks facing our organization, discuss transition and physical risk concepts, and review potential Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)."}

In 2020, a Group ESG Committee was established to provide senior executive involvement and holistic oversight of ESG matters material to our organization. The Committee is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operening Officer, and includes the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, the HR Director, and senior representatives from our business units. One of the Group ESG Committee's responsibilities is to oversee our progress towards fulfilling our commitment to report against the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In 2020, the Group ESG Committee reported to the Board through the Nomination & Governance Committee.\n\nThe Board recognizes that the next 12 to 18 months are critical for the implementation of our ESG Strategic Framework. Therefore, in early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight during this period. The Working Group is chaired by a Non-executive Director and comprises four other Non-executive Directors.\n\nOur company's policies and procedures for managing Environmental, Social, and Governance issues are outlined in our Group Governance Manual. This manual is subject to an annual content review, taking into consideration both internal and external factors. Any instances of non-compliance with the manual identified by our businesses through their annual attestation are assessed by the policy owners and reported to the Group Audit Committee.\n\nWe believe that our new strategic ESG framework and long-term goals to reduce our carbon footprint and support an inclusive transition are essential for meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary obligations. This approach will help us reduce our exposure to asset risk over time while contributing to global decarbonization efforts. Our Risk function conducted an initial transition risk analysis on insurance assets managed in segregated portfolios by our asset managers. This analysis focused on investments where we maintain direct control and exert influence over the investment process. Preliminary reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to our overall carbon footprint metrics and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded. It also enables us to determine and monitor the most carbon-intensive companies held in our asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes of our insurance investment portfolio.\n\nThe Board's oversight of climate change risk has been significantly strengthened. In 2020, ESG was overseen by the Board through the Nomination & Governance Committee.

Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisation's businesses, strategy, and financial planning.\n", "answer": "After conducting a thorough ESG review, our company has established a new Strategic Framework (the 'framework') for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues. This framework aligns with our business strategy and our mission to help individuals maximize their potential, build wealth, and achieve their financial goals. The framework consists of three strategic pillars, each with a clear connection to our business strategy. Within these pillars, specific focus areas have been identified where our company can make a significant impact.\n\nWe are confident that this new ESG framework and our long-term goals to decrease carbon emissions and promote an inclusive transition will meet stakeholder expectations and uphold our fiduciary responsibilities. The framework will enable us to manage risk over the long term and contribute to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Acknowledging that transition risk poses the most immediate and impactful financial risk, we have assessed the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio. This analysis focused on investments where our company holds significant influence. Preliminary reports were generated using climate-related data and metrics from a proprietary vendor tool. This process allows for a sector-by-sector breakdown of carbon footprint metrics and identification of the most carbon-intensive companies in our investment portfolio. We have also calculated the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) for the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes in our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in markets with varying levels of development. Some markets boast diversified, service-led economies and advanced financial systems, while others rely heavily on primary and energy-intensive industries. In emerging markets, the energy transition is likely to progress more slowly than in advanced economies. This was emphasized by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), during a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. Mr. Menon stated that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs, and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are dedicated to reducing carbon emissions in our investment portfolio, we recognize the importance of implementing this strategy in a manner that acknowledges the unique challenges of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition equitably. Our commitment to an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities to all stakeholders. We understand the significance of collaboration in driving an inclusive transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we collaborate with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition.

For extreme climate change events like floods and strong winds, we have already integrated prevention systems into our facilities and will not be calculating their financial impact.\n\nOur company has also assessed the potential cost of reputational damage resulting from failing to meet net zero emission targets. However, there is no universally accepted methodology for estimating such financial impact. The financial impact of a 1% revenue reduction was a consensus reached by experts following discussions and evaluations. The financial impact from climate opportunities includes cost savings from enhanced energy and water use efficiency and diverse water sources, as well as additional revenue from offering low-carbon products and services such as 7nm or more advanced processes, Power Management ICs (PMICs), and ultralow power (ULP) ICs.\n\nThe findings from our analysis suggest that the development of low-carbon products and services presents the most significant opportunity for positive financial impacts, as the demand for low-carbon products and advanced manufacturing processes continues to expand."}

We have considered the outcomes when determining the resiliency of strategies and have also referred to the latest physical science basis, published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to develop our own climate scenarios. In addition, we have also included potential growth in carbon emissions from expanding our business and new facilities as well as existing carbon reduction actions into general evaluations to analyze the potential financial impacts of climate risks. In the past, we evaluated climate risks solely using the worst-case scenario, but the future of climate change is highly unpredictable. As such, we have opted to evaluate climate risks across several scenarios this year to help map out and communicate operations strategies internally and give comprehensive insights into climate trends over the mid-to-long term.\n\nClimate Scenario Selection\nIn terms of transition risks, there is now a global consensus that carbon pricing schemes are a necessary policy to achieve net zero emissions. We have referred to the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO), an IEA report commonly used by companies, and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to conduct climate scenario analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing then serves as the basis for us to evaluate the impacts of carbon pricing schemes on our locations in different countries.\n\nIn terms of physical risks, we have referred to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) published by IPCC in 2021 and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes in the future. We also adopted the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) to derive GHG emissions under different social and economic landscapes. Our impact analysis on physical risks covers climate change evaluations across every region of the globe and provides detailed impact analysis to our business and suppliers around the world through downscaling analysis."}
