Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. ISO 14001 defines an environmental aspect as an element of an organization's activities, products, or services that has or may have an impact on the environment. Our significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system. Each environmental aspect, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, is ranked from 0 through 4 based on criteria like severity, magnitude, probability, frequency, controllability, duration, employee concerns, community concerns, boundaries, business impact, and regulatory. The highest scores identify our significant impacts, which we focus on in more detail in our environmental management systems.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our suppliers of raw materials. As a global organization, we rely on various suppliers for raw materials, some of which may be subject to supply constraints due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."}

{"instruction": "Prepared to offer guidance on risk management strategies, given your proficiency with the TCFD framework.", "input": "Answer the following questions: \n1. Managing climate-related risk and opportunities\n", "answer": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a benchmark year. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nTogether with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in a certain country has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."}

Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nThe collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our water strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in a certain country has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the rainy season, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low, due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."}

Addressing and leveraging climate-related risks and opportunities\n", "answer": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our Business Services (SI) division, for instance, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For example, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to reduce our emissions by half compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation.

Enterprise risk management process\n", "answer": "Our company has established and overseen a collection of risk management and control mechanisms to identify developments that may threaten our business continuity. Central components of these mechanisms include enterprise-wide procedures for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning enables us to recognize potential risks prior to significant business decisions, while management reporting facilitates closer monitoring of risks as our business advances. Our internal auditors regularly evaluate the sufficiency and efficiency of our risk management, and any shortcomings can be remedied through suitable measures.\n\nOur risk management strategy is all-encompassing, dynamic, and management-focused, and is embedded within our organization. It encompasses both risks and opportunities. Our strategy adheres to globally recognized standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO 31000, and is customized to our company's specifications. The frameworks link our risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system.\n\nOur risk management process aims for early recognition and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially impact our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The timeframe is generally three years, and we employ a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities that remain following the implementation of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a systematic manner, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting typically follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues promptly.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on impact and probability, taking into account various viewpoints, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down component ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at various management levels and are incorporated into the subsequent reporting process, if deemed relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are assessed for potential cumulative effects and are consolidated within and for each of the departments mentioned. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. Our response strategies include avoidance, transfer, reduction, acceptance, and capitalizing on opportunities. For each risk or opportunity, responsibility entails the development, initiation, and monitoring of suitable response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures are specifically designed to facilitate effective risk management.\n\nOur company manages various risks, including those related to economic conditions and customer demand, project risks, and risks from the transmission of infectious agents. We closely monitor macroeconomic trends and developments in relevant industries to address the risk of economic instability and fluctuating customer demand. We maintain adequate insurance coverage for potential damage and liability risks to minimize our exposure and mitigate potential losses. We continually gather information from relevant sources to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related countermeasures as early as possible."}

Corporate risk management framework\n", "answer": "Our company has implemented and coordinated a set of risk management and control systems to support the early recognition of developments that could jeopardize our business continuity. These systems include enterprise-wide processes for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning helps us consider potential risks before major business decisions, while management reporting enables us to monitor such risks more closely as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management. If deficiencies are detected, appropriate measures can be adopted for their elimination. This coordination of processes and procedures is intended to help ensure that our Managing Board and Supervisory Board are fully informed about significant risks in a timely manner.\n\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-oriented, integrated into the organization, and addresses both risks and opportunities. It is based on globally accepted standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO Standard 31000, and is adapted to our requirements. The frameworks connect the risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system. They consider our strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of our business operations, the reliability of our financial reporting, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important.\n\nOur risk management process aims for early identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievement of our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues in a timely manner.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized in terms of impact and likelihood, considering different impact perspectives, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed regarding potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational units mentioned above. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the hierarchical level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. In a first step, assuming responsibility for a specific risk or opportunity involves choosing one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies with respect to risks are avoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance of the relevant risk. Our general response strategy with respect to opportunities is to \"seize\" the relevant opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures have to be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates by engaging in hedging activities. Regarding our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and complemented by clearly defined approval processes, assists us in identifying and responding to project risks at an early stage, even before the bidding phase. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential cases of damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure to such risks and to avoid or minimize potential losses.\n\nWe address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries and adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary.\n\nOur company constantly checks information from reputable sources, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the American and European Centers for Disease Control, and the German Robert Koch Institute, to be able to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible. We have established procedures to respond effectively to such risks, including communication with employees, customers, and stakeholders, as well as the implementation of necessary protective measures."}

Describe the Board's oversight of climate related risks and opportunities.\n", "answer": "Our company's Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives are overseen by the Board, which determines strategy and priority areas. The Board recognizes the importance of these initiatives and has established a Group ESG Committee to provide senior executive involvement and holistic oversight. The Committee is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and includes the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, the HR Director, and senior representatives from our business units. One of the Group ESG Committee's responsibilities is to oversee our progress towards fulfilling our commitment to report against the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In 2020, the Group ESG Committee reported to the Board through a relevant committee.\n\nThe Board recognizes that the next 12 to 18 months are critical for the implementation of our ESG Strategic Framework and related matters, such as the development and embedding of our purpose and values, diversity and inclusion (D&I) priorities, and employee engagement activities. In early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight during this period.\n\nOur policies and procedures for managing ESG issues are outlined in our Governance Manual. The Manual is subject to an annual formal content review, taking into consideration internal and external factors. Any instances of non-compliance identified through annual attestations are assessed by policy owners and reported to the Audit Committee.\n\nWe believe that our new strategic ESG framework and long-term goals to decarbonize our investment portfolio and support an inclusive transition are essential for meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary obligations. This approach will reduce our exposure to asset risk, including transition risk, over time, while also contributing to global decarbonization efforts. Our Risk function conducted an initial transition risk analysis on insurance assets managed in segregated portfolios by our asset managers. This analysis focused on investments where we maintain control and exert influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to our overall carbon footprint metrics and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded. It also enables the identification and monitoring of the most carbon-intensive companies held in our asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of our listed equity and corporate bond asset classes.\n\nThe Board's oversight of climate change risk has been significantly strengthened.

The Board recognizes the importance of senior executive involvement and holistic oversight of ESG matters material to our organization. In 2020, a Group ESG Committee was established to provide this oversight. The Committee is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and includes the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, the HR Director, and senior representatives from our business units. One of the Group ESG Committee's responsibilities is to oversee our progress towards fulfilling our commitment to report against the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In 2020, the Group ESG Committee reported to the Board through the Nomination & Governance Committee.\n\nThe Board understands that the next 12 to 18 months are critical for the implementation of our ESG Strategic Framework. Therefore, in early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight during this period. The Working Group is chaired by a Non-executive Director and comprises four other Non-executive Directors.\n\nOur company's policies and procedures for managing ESG issues are outlined in our Group Governance Manual. This manual is subject to an annual content review, taking into consideration both internal and external factors. Any instances of non-compliance with the manual identified by our businesses through their annual attestation are assessed by the policy owners and reported to the Group Audit Committee.\n\nWe believe that our new strategic ESG framework and long-term goals to reduce our carbon footprint and support an inclusive transition are essential for meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary obligations. This approach will help us reduce our exposure to asset risk over time while contributing to global decarbonization efforts. Our Risk function conducted an initial transition risk analysis on insurance assets managed in segregated portfolios by our asset managers. This analysis focused on investments where we maintain direct control and exert influence over the investment process. Preliminary reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to our overall carbon footprint metrics and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded. It also enables us to determine and monitor the most carbon-intensive companies held in our asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes of our insurance investment portfolio.\n\nThe Board's oversight of climate change risk has been significantly strengthened.
