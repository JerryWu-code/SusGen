As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our policies and procedures, including a Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy, help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact.

We assess risks related to financial and market performance, operational performance, emergency preparedness and response, environment, health and safety compliance, among other areas. We prioritize risks based on their impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers, as well as regulatory requirements. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments evaluate business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have reviewed potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. We have considered raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management discusses which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success. We also consult external stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. ISO 14001 defines an environmental aspect as an element of an organization's activities, products, or services that has or may have an impact on the environment. Our significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system. Each environmental aspect, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, is ranked from 0 through 4 based on criteria like severity, magnitude, probability, frequency, controllability, duration, employee concerns, community concerns, boundaries, business impact, and regulatory. The highest scores identify our significant impacts, which we focus on in more detail in our environmental management systems.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our suppliers of raw materials. As a global company, we rely on various suppliers for raw materials, some of which may be subject to supply constraints due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nWe assess upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nWe assess downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact.

{"instruction": "Prepared to offer guidance on risk management practices with your proficiency in the TCFD framework.", "input": "Answer the following questions: \n1. Managing climate-related risk and opportunities\n", "answer": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the U.S., Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tools with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."}

This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the US, Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our water strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low, due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."}

Addressing and leveraging climate-related risks and opportunities\n", "answer": "Our company does not see any significant transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our Business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed.

This approach will reduce our exposure to asset risk, including transition risk, over time, while also contributing to global decarbonization efforts. Our Risk function conducted an initial transition risk analysis on insurance assets managed in segregated portfolios by our asset managers. This analysis focused on investments where we maintain direct control and exert influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to our overall carbon footprint metrics and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded. It also enables the identification and monitoring of the most carbon-intensive companies held in our asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of our listed equity and corporate bond asset classes.\n\nThe Board's oversight of climate change risk has been significantly strengthened.

Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisation's businesses, strategy, and financial planning.\n", "answer": "After conducting a thorough ESG review, our company has formulated a new Strategic Framework (the 'framework') for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) matters. This framework aligns with our business strategy and our mission to help individuals maximize their potential, build wealth, and achieve their savings goals. The framework consists of three strategic pillars, each of which aligns with our business strategy. In each pillar, we have identified specific focus areas where our company can make a significant impact.\n\nOur company is dedicated to meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary duties through the new ESG framework and our long-term goals to decrease carbon emissions and support a fair transition. This approach will enable us to manage risk over the long term while contributing to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. We recognize that transition risk poses the most immediate and impactful financial risk and have initiated an analysis of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio. This analysis focused on investments where our company holds significant influence. Preliminary reports were generated using climate-related data and metrics supplied by a proprietary vendor tool. This process allows for a sector-by-sector breakdown of carbon footprint metrics and identification of the most carbon-intensive companies in our investment portfolio. Additionally, we have determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) for the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes in our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in markets with varying levels of development. Some markets boast diversified, service-led economies and mature financial markets, while others rely more heavily on primary and energy-intensive industries. Emerging markets have a greater dependence on fossil fuels for their energy generation and less developed financial systems. The energy transition in these regions is expected to progress more slowly than in advanced economies. This was emphasized by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), during a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. Mr. Menon stated, 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs, and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nOur commitment to reducing carbon emissions in our investment portfolio is balanced with an understanding of the unique challenges posed by the markets in which we operate. We aim to implement our strategy in a manner that acknowledges these realities and shares the financial and social burden of the transition fairly. Our support for an inclusive transition includes collaboration with various stakeholders. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we work with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale up domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group our company has co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to generate new ideas for scaling up investments to further the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."}

Due to challenges in data sourcing and processes, there have been impacts on certain climate disclosures.\n\nClimate scenario analysis is used as a risk assessment tool to provide insights on the long-term effects of transition and physical risks across our corporate and retail banking portfolios, as well as our own operations. Our sustainable finance ambition enables sustainable infrastructure and energy systems, promotes decarbonisation efforts across the real economy, and enhances investor capital through sustainable investment.\n\nWe aim to achieve net zero in our financed emissions by 2050 and in our own operations and supply chain by 2030. We aim to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn of sustainable finance and investment for our customers in their transition to net zero and a sustainable future.\n\nOur assessment of climate risks covers three distinct time periods: short term (up to 2025), medium term (2026 to 2035), and long term (2036 to 2050). Transition or physical climate-related issues identified are assessed using enhanced questionnaires and scoring tools.\n\nWe support our customers in their transition through our sustainable finance and investment ambition. Our sustainable finance data dictionary includes a detailed definition of contributing activities.\n\nCertain perils, such as coastal, river, and surface water flooding, drive potential credit losses in our retail portfolio. Around 20% of our financed properties are in London, and most are protected by the Thames Barrier.\n\nWe identified six key sectors with the highest exposure to climate transition risk: automotive, chemicals, construction and building materials, metals and mining, oil and gas, and power and utilities. We continued to improve our identification and assessment of climate risk within our retail mortgage portfolio, with increased investments in physical risk data and enhancements to our internal risk assessment capabilities and models.\n\nOpportunities include sustainable finance, sustainable investment, and sustainable infrastructure. For a detailed breakdown of our sustainable finance progress by geography, see the ESG Data Pack.\n\nWe report our exposure to high transition risk sectors in our wholesale portfolio. Since 2020, we have rolled out the questionnaire to include our largest customers in the next highest climate transition risk sectors: agriculture, industrials, real estate, and transportation.\n\nAs a result of climate scenario analysis, our largest and most impacted sectors \u2013 power and utilities, construction and building materials, and chemicals \u2013 are subject to increased levels of transition risks. Our asset management division is increasingly considering both physical and transition risks and integrating ESG and climate analysis into the investment decision-making process.\n\nTransition to net zero represents one of our strategic pillars. We aim to be net zero in our operations and supply chain by 2030 and in our financed emissions by 2050. Scenario analysis supports our strategy by assessing our position under a range of climate scenarios and helping us plan for the future and meet growing regulatory requirements.\n\nWe continue to develop our climate scenario analysis exercises to have a more comprehensive understanding of climate headwinds, risks, and opportunities that will support our strategic planning and actions. We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of climate-related issues on financial planning, particularly the impact on financial performance and financial position. We expect to further enhance our disclosure and processes in relation to acquisitions/divestments in the medium term.\n\nClimate change poses a physical risk to the buildings we occupy as an organization, including offices, retail branches, and data centers. We use stress testing to evaluate the potential impact to our owned or leased premises. Our scenario stress test, conducted in 2022, analyzed how seven different climate change-related hazards could impact 500 of our critical and important buildings.\n\nOur Climate Solutions Partnership is a philanthropic initiative that aims to identify and remove barriers to scale for climate change solutions. We support start-up companies developing carbon-cutting technologies, nature-based solutions, renewable energy initiatives in Asia, and the WWF-led Asia Sustainable Palm Oil Links programme.\n\nDuring Board meetings, we balance discussions on the company's performance, emerging risks, and duties to shareholders while remaining conscious of responsibilities to support communities and help customers. In 2022, the Board approved an update to the thermal coal phase-out policy and the publication of an updated energy policy. We have committed to publishing our own climate transition plan in 2023.

It enhances our awareness of climate change, helps us plan for the future, and meets our growing regulatory requirements. In 2022, we conducted our first internal climate scenario analysis exercise, employing four scenarios to represent the potential outcomes for global climate change. This analysis focused on the key regions where our company operates and evaluated the impact on our balance sheet between the 2022 and 2050 time period.\nKey drivers of performance and their consideration:\nClimate scenario analysis enables our company to model how different potential climate pathways may impact our customers and portfolios, particularly in terms of credit losses. Under the Current Commitments scenario, we anticipate moderate levels of losses related to transition risks. However, the rise in global warming will lead to increasing levels of physical risk losses in later years.\nScenarios employed and their relation to government policies:\nThe scenario assumptions for our climate stress testing exercise include varying levels of governmental climate policy changes, macroeconomic factors, and technological developments. However, these scenarios depend on the development of technologies that are still uncertain, such as global hydrogen production to decarbonize aviation and shipping. For more information on the assumptions, please refer to our ESG Data Pack.\nPossible adjustments to our strategies:\nThe nature of the scenarios, our evolving capabilities, and the limitations of the analysis result in indicative outcomes of climate change headwinds, although they are not a definitive forecast. Developments in climate science, data, methodology, and scenario analysis techniques will help us refine our approach further. Therefore, we anticipate this view of risk to evolve over time. Our company intends to continue strengthening our capabilities for climate scenario analysis and using the results for decision-making, particularly in respect to strategy, by utilizing the range of scenario analysis outcomes to shape our strategy across business and regions. Our company does not currently fully disclose the impacts of transition and physical risk quantitatively due to transitional challenges, including data limitations and evolving science and methodologies."}

Our transition risk assessment concentrates on the sectors of electric utilities and oil, gas & coal in Japan. The analysis timeframe spans until 2050, although the International Energy Agency (IEA) scenario only extends to 2040. The estimated cost increases under dynamic and static scenarios are approximately \u00a5120 billion and \u00a5310 billion, respectively. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios we considered are 8.5 (4\u00b0C) and 2.6 (2\u00b0C).\n\nIn assessing potential impacts on our clients' businesses, we applied two scenarios: a static scenario, which assumes no change in the existing business structure, and a dynamic scenario, under which the business structure adapts to the transformation. Our analysis primarily focused on credit costs through 2050.\n\nWe utilized a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the frequencies at which typhoons and other storms cause wind and water-related building loss or damage. We then analyzed the potential direct (collateral value) and indirect (business stagnation) impacts on our company's credit costs from the loss or damage of mortgaged real estate (buildings) in Japan.

We have considered the outcomes when determining the resiliency of strategies and have also referred to the latest physical science basis, published by reputable organizations such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to develop our own climate scenarios. In addition, we have also included potential growth in carbon emissions from expanding our operations and new facilities as well as existing carbon reduction actions into general evaluations to analyze the potential financial impacts of climate risks. In the past, we evaluated climate risks solely using the worst-case scenario, but the future of climate change is highly unpredictable. As such, we have opted to evaluate climate risks across several scenarios this year to help map out and communicate operations strategies internally and give comprehensive insights into climate trends over the mid-to-long term.\n\nClimate Scenario Selection\nIn terms of transition risks, there is now a global consensus that carbon pricing schemes are a necessary policy to achieve net zero emissions. We have referred to widely used reports, such as the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO) published by the IEA, and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to conduct climate scenario analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing then serves as the basis for us to evaluate the impacts of carbon pricing schemes on our locations in different countries.\n\nIn terms of physical risks, we have referred to the latest reports published by reputable organizations such as the IPCC and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes in the future. We have also adopted the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) to derive GHG emissions under different social and economic landscapes. Our impact analysis on physical risks covers climate change evaluations across every region of the globe and provides detailed impact analysis to our locations and suppliers around the world through downscaling analysis."}

We prioritize risks based on their impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being part of this process.\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is interviewed to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, our reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."}

{"instruction": "Prepared to offer guidance with your proficiency in the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) framework, you will be assisting in implementing effective risk management practices.", "input": "Answer the following questions: \n1. Managing climate-related risk and opportunities\n", "answer": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our Business Unit, for instance, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. Our Business Unit strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For example, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. In the current year, we managed to reduce our emissions by half compared to 2014. This program not only reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations but also upstream through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nTogether with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the U.S., Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal Siemens Water Tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."}

Enterprise risk management process\n", "answer": "Our company has established and overseen a collection of risk management and control mechanisms to facilitate the early identification of potential threats to our business continuity. Central components of these mechanisms include enterprise-wide procedures for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning enables us to recognize potential risks prior to significant business moves, while management reporting allows us to closely monitor risks as our business advances. Our internal auditors routinely evaluate the sufficiency and efficiency of our risk management, and any shortcomings can be remedied through suitable measures.\n\nOur risk management strategy is all-encompassing, collaborative, and focused on management, and is embedded within our organization. It encompasses both risks and opportunities. Our strategy is grounded in globally recognized standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO 31000, and is customized to our company's specifications. The frameworks link our risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system.\n\nOur risk management process strives for early recognition and assessment of risks and opportunities that could materially impact our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is generally three years, and we employ a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities that remain after the implementation of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a systematic manner, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting typically follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues in a timely fashion.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on impact and probability, taking into account various viewpoints, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down component ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at various management levels and are incorporated into the subsequent reporting process, if deemed relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are categorized within and for each of the departments mentioned. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. Our response strategies include avoidance, transfer, reduction, acceptance, and capitalizing on opportunities. For each risk or opportunity, responsibility entails the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy.

Corporate risk management framework\n", "answer": "Our company has implemented and coordinated a set of risk management and control systems to support the early recognition of developments that could jeopardize business continuity. These systems include enterprise-wide processes for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning helps us consider potential risks before major business decisions, while management reporting enables us to monitor such risks more closely as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management. If deficiencies are detected, appropriate measures can be adopted for their elimination. This coordination of processes and procedures is intended to help ensure that the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board are fully informed about significant risks in a timely manner.\n\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-oriented, integrated into the organization, and addresses both risks and opportunities. It is based on globally accepted standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO Standard 31000, and is adapted to our requirements. The frameworks connect the risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system. They consider our strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of our business operations, the reliability of our financial reporting, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important.\n\nOur risk management process aims for early identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievement of our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues in a timely manner.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized in terms of impact and likelihood, considering different impact perspectives, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed regarding potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational units mentioned above. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the hierarchical level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. In a first step, assuming responsibility for a specific risk or opportunity involves choosing one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies with respect to risks are avoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance of the relevant risk. Our general response strategy with respect to opportunities is to \"seize\" the relevant opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures have to be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates by engaging in hedging activities. Regarding our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and complemented by clearly defined approval processes, assists us in identifying and responding to project risks at an early stage, even before the bidding phase. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential cases of damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure to such risks and to avoid or minimize potential losses.\n\nWe address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries and adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary.\n\nOur company constantly checks information from reputable sources, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the American and European Centers for Disease Control, and the German Robert Koch Institute, to be able to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible."}

Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisation's businesses, strategy, and financial planning.\n", "answer": "After conducting a thorough ESG review, our company has established a new Strategic Framework (the 'framework'). This framework aligns with our business strategy and our mission to help individuals maximize their potential, build wealth, and achieve their savings goals. The framework consists of three strategic pillars, each with a clear connection to our business strategy. Within these pillars, we have identified focus areas where our company can make a significant impact.\n\nWe are confident that our new ESG strategic framework and our long-term goals to decrease carbon emissions and support a fair transition are essential for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and discharge our fiduciary duties. This framework will enable us to manage risk over time and contribute to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Given that transition risk represents the most immediate and impactful financial risk, we have assessed the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio. Our analysis focused on investments where our company holds significant influence and control over the investment process. Preliminary reports were generated using climate-related data and metrics provided by a proprietary vendor tool. This analysis provides a sector-by-sector breakdown of the carbon footprint metrics of our asset book and pinpoints the most carbon-intensive sectors. It also allows us to identify and monitor the most carbon-heavy companies in our asset book. We have also calculated the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) for the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes in our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in markets with varying levels of development. Some markets boast diversified, service-oriented economies and sophisticated financial systems, while others rely heavily on primary industries and energy-intensive sectors. In emerging markets, the energy transition is likely to progress at a slower pace than in advanced economies. This was emphasized by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), during a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. Mr. Menon stated that 'Emerging markets are at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to basic necessities like electricity, modern sanitation, and clean water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most emerging economies remain heavily reliant on fossil fuels for their energy needs, and it is unrealistic to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy overnight.'\n\nFor our company, this implies that while we are dedicated to reducing carbon emissions in our investment portfolio, we recognize the importance of implementing this strategy in a manner that acknowledges the unique characteristics of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition equitably. Our commitment to a fair transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We understand the significance of coalition building in driving a fair transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we collaborate with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale up domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group our company has co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to generate new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."}

It also enables us to determine and monitor the carbon intensity of our listed equity and corporate bond asset classes.\n\nOur company operates in various markets, including mature economies with diversified, service-led economies and well-established financial markets, as well as emerging markets that are more reliant on primary and energy-intensive industries. These emerging markets have a greater dependence on fossil fuels for energy generation and less developed financial systems. The energy transition in these regions is expected to progress more slowly than in advanced economies.\n\nGiven this context, we are committed to decarbonizing our investment portfolio but recognize the need to implement this strategy in a manner that acknowledges the unique characteristics of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition fairly. Our support for an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders.\n\nWe understand the importance of collaboration in driving an inclusive transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), we collaborate with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to increase domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group we have co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to generate new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."}

Detail the influence of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization's business activities, strategic goals, and financial forecasts.\n", "answer": "After conducting a thorough ESG review, our company has established a new ESG Strategic Framework. This framework aligns with our business strategy and our mission to help individuals maximize their potential, build wealth, and achieve their savings goals. The framework consists of three strategic pillars, each with a focus area where our company can make a significant impact.\n\nWe are confident that this new ESG framework and our commitment to decarbonizing our investment portfolio and supporting an inclusive transition will meet stakeholder expectations and uphold our fiduciary responsibilities. By reducing our exposure to asset risk, including transition risk, over time, we will contribute to global decarbonization efforts. Recognizing the significance of transition risk, we have conducted a preliminary analysis on our investment assets. This analysis focused on investments where our company holds direct control and exerts influence over the investment process. We used climate-related data and metrics from a proprietary vendor tool to assess the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio and identify the most carbon-intensive sectors and companies. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of our listed equity and corporate bond asset classes.\n\nOur company operates in various markets, including mature economies with diversified, service-led industries and emerging markets that are more reliant on primary and energy-intensive industries. The energy transition in emerging markets is likely to progress at a slower pace than in advanced economies. Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), emphasized this point during a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. He noted that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs, and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nOur commitment to decarbonizing our investment portfolio is balanced by our understanding of the unique challenges posed by the markets in which we operate. We aim to share the financial and social burden of the transition in a fair manner and recognize the importance of coalition building in delivering an inclusive transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), we collaborate with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP's ASEAN Hub, which our company has co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to catalyze new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."}

It enhances our understanding of climate change, enables us to plan for the future, and helps us meet our growing regulatory requirements. In 2022, we conducted our initial internal climate scenario analysis exercise, employing four scenarios to represent the spectrum of potential climate change outcomes. This analysis focused on the key regions where our company operates and evaluated the impact on our balance sheet between the 2022 and 2050 timeframe.\n\nKey performance drivers and their consideration: Climate scenario analysis allows us to model how different potential climate pathways may influence our customer base and investment portfolios, primarily in terms of credit losses. Under the Current Commitments scenario, we anticipate moderate levels of losses related to transition risks. However, the rise in global warming will result in increasing levels of physical risk losses in later years.\n\nGovernment policies and their role in scenarios: The assumptions for our climate stress testing exercise encompass varying levels of governmental climate policy changes, macroeconomic factors, and technological developments. However, these scenarios hinge on the development of technologies that are still uncertain, such as global hydrogen production to decarbonize aviation and shipping. For more information on the assumptions, please refer to our ESG Data Pack.\n\nAdapting strategies in response to climate scenarios: The nature of the scenarios, our evolving capabilities, and the limitations of the analysis result in indicative outcomes of climate change headwinds, although they do not represent a direct forecast. Developments in climate science, data, methodology, and scenario analysis techniques will help us refine our approach further. Consequently, we anticipate this perspective on risk to evolve over time. Our company intends to continue enhancing our capabilities for climate scenario analysis and employ the results for decision-making, particularly in relation to strategy, by utilizing the range of scenario analysis outcomes to shape our strategy across business units and regions. Currently, we do not fully disclose the impacts of transition and physical risk quantitatively due to transitional challenges, including data limitations and evolving science and methodologies."}

Financial impact analysis of climate-related risks primarily focuses on market and technology-related costs to help us reduce carbon emissions, in line with our Net Zero Emissions by 2050 goal. This includes expenses on energy conservation or carbon reduction facilities, more expensive renewable energy or RECs, carbon credits, and additional costs due to uncertainties in the development of new energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies.\n\nPhysical risks mainly focus on growing electricity costs due to chronic climate changes, such as rising temperatures. Costs related to combating drought include expenses for building water reclamation systems, using reclaimed water, and purchasing backup water sources. For acute climate change disasters like floods and strong winds, we have already designed prevention systems into our facilities and will not be calculating their financial impact.\n\nOur company has also estimated the cost of reputation damage from failing to meet net zero emission targets. However, there is no globally recognized approach to estimate such financial impact. The financial impact of a 1% revenue reduction was a consensus reached by experts after discussions and assessments. The estimated financial impact from climate opportunities includes reduced costs from increased energy and water use efficiency and diverse water sources, as well as additional income from providing low-carbon products and services such as advanced semiconductor processes, Power Management ICs (PMICs), and ultralow power (ULP) ICs.\n\nAnalysis results indicate that developing low-carbon products and services presents the greatest opportunity for positive financial impacts, as demands for such products and services continue to grow."}

We have taken into account the consequences of these risks when formulating the robustness of our strategies and have also consulted the most recent physical science data, published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to establish our own climate models. Furthermore, we have integrated potential increases in carbon emissions from expanding our operations and new facilities, as well as existing carbon reduction measures, into our evaluations to examine the potential financial consequences of climate risks. Previously, we assessed climate risks solely based on the worst-case scenario; however, the future of climate change is uncertain. Consequently, we have elected to evaluate climate risks under multiple scenarios this year to help design and communicate internal strategies and offer a comprehensive understanding of climate tendencies over the medium-to-long term.\n\nClimate Scenario Selection\nRegarding transition risks, there is a global agreement that carbon pricing mechanisms are essential for achieving net zero emissions. We consulted the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO), an IEA report widely utilized by companies worldwide, and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to perform climate risk analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing serves as the foundation for us to evaluate the implications of carbon pricing schemes on our facilities in various countries.\n\nIn terms of physical risks, we consulted the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) published by IPCC in 2021 and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes in the future. We also adopted the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) to derive GHG emissions under diverse social and economic contexts. Our impact analysis on physical risks encompasses climate change evaluations across every region globally and offers detailed impact assessments to our locations and suppliers worldwide through downscaling analysis."}
