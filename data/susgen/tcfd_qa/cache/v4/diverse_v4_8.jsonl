ISO 14001 defines an environmental aspect as an element of an organization's activities, products, or services that has or may have an impact on the environment. Our significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system. Each environmental aspect, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, is ranked from 0 through 4 based on criteria like severity, magnitude, probability, frequency, controllability, duration, employee concerns, community concerns, boundaries, business impact, and regulatory. The highest scores identify our significant impacts, which we focus on in more detail in our environmental management systems.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our suppliers of raw materials. As a global company, we rely on various suppliers for raw materials, some of which may be subject to supply constraints due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."}

{"instruction": "I serve as a TCFD expert.\n\nText:\nThe TCFD framework is essential for understanding and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nI. Introduction\n\nAs a TCFD specialist, I cannot stress enough the significance of the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) framework. This voluntary reporting framework, developed by the Financial Stability Board, is crucial for organizations to effectively understand, assess, and disclose climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nII. Importance of TCFD\n\nThe TCFD framework is essential for several reasons. First, it provides a consistent and transparent approach for organizations to disclose climate-related information, making it easier for investors, lenders, and other stakeholders to make informed decisions. Second, it helps organizations better understand their own climate risks and opportunities, enabling them to take appropriate action to mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities. Lastly, the TCFD framework aligns with regulatory trends and investor expectations, making it an increasingly important consideration for businesses.\n\nIII. TCFD Reporting Requirements\n\nThe TCFD framework consists of four main areas: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. Organizations are required to disclose information related to these areas in their annual reports or other public disclosures.\n\nA. Governance\n\nOrganizations must disclose their board oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities, as well as the role of management in assessing and managing these risks.\n\nB. Strategy\n\nOrganizations must describe the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on their business strategy, as well as their response to those impacts.\n\nC. Risk Management\n\nOrganizations must disclose their processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks, as well as their risk assessment results.\n\nD. Metrics and Targets\n\nOrganizations must provide metrics and targets related to climate-related risks and opportunities, allowing stakeholders to evaluate their progress in addressing these risks and opportunities.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, as a TCFD specialist, I strongly encourage organizations to adopt the TCFD framework. By doing so, they will not only meet the expectations of investors, lenders, and regulators but also gain a better understanding of their own climate risks and opportunities, enabling them to take appropriate action and capitalize on opportunities.\n\nV.

{"instruction": "Prepared to offer guidance with your proficiency in the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) framework, you will be assisting in implementing effective risk management practices.", "input": "Answer the following questions: \n1. Managing climate-related risk and opportunities\n", "answer": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the U.S., Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers.

Handling climate-related risk and opportunities\n", "answer": "Our company does not see any significant transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nThe collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our water strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in a water-stressed country has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the rainy season, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low, due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."}

Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisation's businesses, strategy, and financial planning.\n", "answer": "Following our ESG review, we have developed a new ESG Strategic Framework (the 'framework'). This framework is fully aligned to our business strategy and our purpose of helping people to get the most out of life, accumulate wealth, and save for their goals. The key features of our ESG framework include its three strategic pillars, which have clear alignment with our business strategy. Within each of these, specific differentiating focus areas have been identified where we believe our company can make a meaningful impact.\n\nWe believe that the new strategic ESG framework and the long-term goals to reduce carbon emissions and support an inclusive transition are an important way for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and fulfill our fiduciary obligations. It will help us manage risk over time, while also contributing to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Recognizing that transition risk represents the nearest-term and most impactful financial risk, we have conducted an initial analysis of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio. This analysis focused on investments where our company maintains control and exerts influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to the overall carbon footprint metrics of the asset book and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors. It also enables us to determine and monitor the most carbon-intensive companies held in the asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes of our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in markets with varying levels of development. Some markets have diversified, service-led economies and mature financial markets, while others are more dependent on primary and energy-intensive industries. These emerging markets have a greater reliance on fossil fuels in their generation mix and less developed financial systems. The energy transition across the region is likely to proceed at a slower pace than for advanced economies. This point was highlighted by a senior executive from a central banking institution in the region. Speaking at a financial conference, he noted that 'Emerging economies are at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are committed to an objective to reduce carbon emissions in our investment portfolio, we are mindful of the need to implement the strategy in a way that acknowledges the nature of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition in a fair manner. Our support for an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We recognize the importance of coalition building in delivering an inclusive transition. As a member of a sustainable investment partnership, we work with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The partnership\u2019s regional hub, whose Steering Group we have co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to catalyze new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."}

The financial analysis of climate-related risks primarily concentrates on market and technology-related costs to minimize carbon emissions, contributing to our Net Zero Emissions by 2050 goal. This encompasses expenditures on energy conservation or carbon reduction facilities, pricier renewable energy or RECs, carbon credits, and additional costs due to uncertainties in the development of new energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies.\n\nPhysical risks predominantly revolve around escalating electricity costs due to chronic climate changes, such as increasing temperatures. Costs associated with combating drought involve expenses for constructing water reclamation systems, utilizing reclaimed water, and acquiring backup water sources. For acute climate change disasters like floods and strong winds, we have integrated prevention systems into our facilities and will not be evaluating their financial impact.\n\nOur company has also estimated the cost of reputation damage from not achieving net zero emission targets, although there is no universally accepted method to quantify such financial impact. The financial impact of a 1% revenue reduction was a consensus reached by experts following discussions and assessments. The financial impact from climate opportunities includes reduced costs from enhanced energy and water use efficiency and diverse water sources, as well as additional revenue from offering low-carbon products and services such as 7nm or more advanced processes, Power Management ICs (PMICs), and ultralow power (ULP) ICs.\n\nAnalysis findings suggest that developing low-carbon products and services offers the most significant opportunity for positive financial impacts, as the demand for low-carbon products and advanced manufacturing processes continues to expand."}

We have considered the outcomes when determining the resiliency of strategies and have also referred to the latest physical science basis, published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to develop our own climate scenarios. In addition, we have also included potential growth in carbon emissions from expanding our business and new facilities as well as existing carbon reduction actions into our evaluations to analyze the potential financial impacts of climate risks. Previously, we evaluated climate risks solely using the worst-case scenario, but the future of climate change is highly unpredictable. As such, we have opted to evaluate climate risks across several scenarios this year to help map out and communicate operations strategies internally and provide comprehensive insights into climate trends over the mid-to-long term.\n\nClimate Scenario Selection\nIn terms of transition risks, there is now a global consensus that carbon pricing schemes are a necessary policy to achieve net zero emissions. We have referred to the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO), an IEA report commonly used by companies, and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to conduct climate scenario analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing then serves as the basis for us to evaluate the impacts of carbon pricing schemes on our locations in different countries.\n\nIn terms of physical risks, we have referred to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) published by IPCC in 2021 and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes in the future. We have also adopted the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) to derive GHG emissions under different social and economic landscapes.
