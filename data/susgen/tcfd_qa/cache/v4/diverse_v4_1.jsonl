We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management discusses which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success. We also consult external stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. ISO 14001 defines an environmental aspect as an element of an organization's activities, products, or services that has or may have an impact on the environment. Our significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system. Each environmental aspect, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, is ranked from 0 through 4 based on criteria like severity, magnitude, probability, frequency, controllability, duration, employee concerns, community concerns, boundaries, business impact, and regulatory. The highest scores identify our significant impacts, which we focus on in more detail in our environmental management systems.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our suppliers of raw materials. As a global company, we rely on various suppliers for raw materials, some of which may be subject to supply constraints due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nWe assess upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nWe assess downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."}

In the case of fossil energy prices, costs for renewables, and regulation, we utilize these scenarios. Within our organization, scenarios are used to compare, challenge, or complement our own strategic planning processes. In doing so, we utilize IHS Autonomy, as well as IEA NPS and IEA SDS, especially in the Gas and Power business. To be a leading partner for our customers and society in decarbonization, an understanding of the technological changes necessary over the next 30+ years is essential.

{"instruction": "Prepared to offer guidance on risk management, drawing from your proficiency with the TCFD framework.", "input": "Answer the following questions: \n1. Managing climate-related risk and opportunities\n", "answer": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the U.S., Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."}

The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions.

Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in a certain country has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low, due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations.

Addressing and leveraging climate-related risks and opportunities\n", "answer": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For example, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area.

The Board recognizes the importance of senior executive involvement and holistic oversight of ESG matters material to our organization. In 2020, a Group ESG Committee was established to provide this involvement. The Committee is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and includes the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, the HR Director, and senior representatives from our business units. One of the Group ESG Committee's responsibilities is to oversee our progress towards fulfilling our commitment to report against the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In 2020, the Group ESG Committee reported to the Board through the Nomination & Governance Committee.\n\nThe Board acknowledges that the next 12 to 18 months are critical for the implementation of our ESG Strategic Framework and related matters, such as the development and embedding of our purpose and values, diversity and inclusion (D&I) priorities, and employee engagement activities. In early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight during this period.\n\nOur policies and procedures for managing ESG issues are outlined in our Group Governance Manual (GGM). The GGM is subject to an annual formal content review, taking into consideration internal and external factors. Any instances of GGM non-compliance identified through annual attestations are assessed by policy owners and reported to the Group Audit Committee.\n\nOur company believes that our new strategic ESG framework and long-term goals to decarbonize our investment portfolio and support an inclusive transition are essential for meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary obligations. This approach will reduce our exposure to asset risk, including transition risk, over time, while also contributing to global decarbonization efforts. Our Risk function conducted an initial transition risk analysis on insurance assets managed in segregated portfolios by our asset managers. This analysis focused on investments where we maintain direct control and exert influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to our overall carbon footprint metrics and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded. It also enables the identification and monitoring of the most carbon-intensive companies held in our asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of our listed equity and corporate bond asset classes.\n\nThe Board's oversight of climate change risk has been significantly strengthened. In 2020, ESG was overseen by the Board through the Nomination & Governance Committee. In early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established until May 2022 to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight of ESG matters (including climate change). A Board Risk Committee workshop was held to evaluate the climate change risks facing our organization, discuss transition and physical risk concepts, and review potential Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)."}

Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisation's businesses, strategy, and financial planning.\n", "answer": "After conducting a thorough ESG review, our company has established a new Strategic Framework (the 'framework'). This framework aligns with our business strategy and our mission to help individuals maximize their potential, build wealth, and achieve their savings goals. The framework consists of three strategic pillars, each with a clear connection to our business strategy. In each pillar, we have identified focus areas where our company can make a significant impact.\n\nWe are confident that our new ESG strategic framework and our long-term goals to decrease carbon emissions and promote an inclusive transition are essential for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and discharge our fiduciary duties. This framework will enable us to manage risk over the long term while contributing to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Given that transition risk represents the most immediate and impactful financial risk, we have initiated an analysis of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio. This analysis focused on investments where our company holds significant influence over the investment process. Preliminary reports were generated using climate-related data and metrics provided through a vendor tool. This process allows us to identify the carbon contributions of various sectors and determine the most carbon-intensive companies in our investment portfolio. We have also calculated the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) for the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes in our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in markets with varying levels of development. Some markets boast diversified, service-led economies and mature financial markets, while others rely more on primary and energy-intensive industries. Emerging markets have a greater dependence on fossil fuels for their energy generation and less developed financial systems. The energy transition in these regions is expected to progress at a slower pace than in advanced economies. This was emphasized by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), during a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. Mr. Menon stated that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs, and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nFor our company, this implies that while we are committed to reducing carbon emissions in our investment portfolio, we recognize the importance of implementing this strategy in a manner that acknowledges the unique characteristics of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition equitably. Our commitment to an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We understand the significance of coalition building in driving an inclusive transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we collaborate with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale up domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition.

Due to challenges in data sourcing and processes, there have been impacts on certain climate disclosures.\n\nClimate scenario analysis is used as a risk assessment tool to provide insights on the long-term effects of transition and physical risks across our corporate and retail banking portfolios, as well as our own operations. Our sustainable finance initiative enables sustainable infrastructure and energy systems, promotes decarbonisation efforts across the real economy, and enhances investor capital through sustainable investment.\n\nWe aim to achieve net zero in our financed emissions by 2050 and in our own operations and supply chain by 2030. We aim to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn of sustainable finance and investment for our customers in their transition to net zero and a sustainable future.\n\nOur assessment of climate risks covers three distinct time periods: short term (up to 2025), medium term (2026 to 2035), and long term (2036 to 2050). Transition or physical climate-related issues identified are assessed using enhanced questionnaires and scoring tools.\n\nWe support our customers in their transition through our sustainable finance and investment initiative. Our sustainable finance data dictionary includes a detailed definition of contributing activities.\n\nCertain perils, such as coastal, river, and surface water flooding, drive potential credit losses in our retail portfolio. Around 20% of our financed properties are in a major city, and most are protected by a flood barrier.\n\nWe identified six key sectors with the highest exposure to climate transition risk: automotive, chemicals, construction and building materials, metals and mining, oil and gas, and power and utilities. We continued to improve our identification and assessment of climate risk within our retail mortgage portfolio, with increased investments in physical risk data and enhancements to our internal risk assessment capabilities and models.\n\nOpportunities include sustainable finance, sustainable investment, and sustainable infrastructure. For a detailed breakdown of our sustainable finance progress by geography, see the ESG Data Pack.\n\nWe report our exposure to high transition risk sectors in our wholesale portfolio. Since 2020, we have rolled out the questionnaire to include our largest customers in the next highest climate transition risk sectors: agriculture, industrials, real estate, and transportation.\n\nAs a result of climate scenario analysis, our largest and most impacted sectors \u2013 power and utilities, construction and building materials, and chemicals \u2013 are subject to increased levels of transition risks. Our asset management division is increasingly considering both physical and transition risks and integrating ESG and climate analysis into the investment decision-making process.\n\nTransition to net zero represents one of our strategic pillars. We aim to be net zero in our operations and supply chain by 2030 and in our financed emissions by 2050. Scenario analysis supports our strategy by assessing our position under a range of climate scenarios and helping us plan for the future and meet growing regulatory requirements.\n\nWe continue to develop our climate scenario analysis exercises to have a more comprehensive understanding of climate headwinds, risks, and opportunities that will support our strategic planning and actions. We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of climate-related issues on financial planning, particularly the impact on financial performance and financial position. We expect to further enhance our disclosure and processes in relation to acquisitions/divestments in the medium term.\n\nClimate change poses a physical risk to the buildings we occupy as an organization, including offices, retail branches, and data centers. We use stress testing to evaluate the potential impact to our owned or leased premises. Our scenario stress test, conducted in 2022, analyzed how seven different climate change-related hazards could impact 500 of our critical and important buildings.\n\nOur Climate Solutions Partnership is a philanthropic initiative that aims to identify and remove barriers to scale for climate change solutions. We support start-up companies developing carbon-cutting technologies, nature-based solutions, renewable energy initiatives, and the WWF-led Asia Sustainable Palm Oil Links programme.\n\nDuring Board meetings, we balance discussions on the company's performance, emerging risks, and duties to shareholders while remaining conscious of responsibilities to support communities and help customers.

Financial impact analysis of climaterelated risks primarily focuses on market and technology-related costs to reduce carbon emissions, aligning with our Net Zero Emissions by 2050 goal. This includes expenses on energy conservation or carbon reduction facilities, more expensive renewable energy or RECs, carbon credits, and additional costs due to uncertainties in the development of new energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies.\n\nPhysical risks mainly focus on growing electricity costs due to chronic climate changes, such as rising temperatures. Costs related to combating drought include expenses for building water reclamation systems, using reclaimed water, and purchasing backup water sources. For acute climate change disasters like floods and strong winds, we have already designed prevention systems into our facilities and will not be calculating their financial impact.\n\nOur company has also estimated the cost of reputation damage from failing to meet net zero emission targets. However, there is no globally recognized approach to estimate such financial impact, and these calculations are subject to uncertainty. The financial impact of a 1% revenue reduction was a consensus reached by experts after discussions and assessments.\n\nThe financial impact of climate opportunities includes reduced costs from increased energy and water use efficiency and diverse water sources, as well as additional income from providing low-carbon products and services. These may include advanced manufacturing processes, Power Management ICs (PMICs), and ultralow power (ULP) ICs.\n\nAnalysis results indicate that developing low-carbon products and services presents the greatest opportunity for positive financial impacts, as demands for such products continue to grow."}

We have taken the outcomes into account when assessing the robustness of strategies and have also consulted the most recent physical science findings, published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to establish our own climate models. Furthermore, we have incorporated the potential increase in carbon emissions from expanding our operations and new facilities, as well as existing carbon reduction measures, into our evaluations to examine the potential financial consequences of climate risks. Previously, we assessed climate risks based on the worst-case scenario alone. However, the future of climate change is uncertain, and as a result, we have chosen to evaluate climate risks under multiple scenarios this year to help shape and communicate internal strategies, as well as to offer a comprehensive understanding of climate trends over the medium-to-long term.\n\nClimate Scenario Selection\nRegarding transition risks, there is now a global agreement that carbon pricing mechanisms are essential for achieving net zero emissions. We consulted the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO), an IEA report widely used by companies worldwide, and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to conduct climate risk analysis on future carbon pricing.
