We have considered raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management discusses which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success. We also consult external stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. ISO 14001 defines an environmental aspect as an element of an organization's activities, products, or services that has or may have an impact on the environment. Our significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system. Each environmental aspect, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, is ranked from 0 through 4 based on criteria like severity, magnitude, probability, frequency, controllability, duration, employee concerns, community concerns, boundaries, business impact, and regulatory. The highest scores identify our significant impacts, which we focus on in more detail in our environmental management systems.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our suppliers of raw materials. As a global organization, we rely on various suppliers for raw materials, some of which may be subject to supply constraints due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the production of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."}

{"instruction": "Prepared to offer guidance on risk management strategies, given your proficiency with the TCFD framework.", "input": "Answer the following questions: \n1. Managing climate-related risk and opportunities\n", "answer": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a benchmark year. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new project that drives the selection process for new sites and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in a certain country has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the rainy season, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."}

SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For example, we have been providing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to reduce our emissions by half compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nThe collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the US, Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our water strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal Siemens Water Tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low, due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."}

Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisation's businesses, strategy, and financial planning.\n", "answer": "After conducting a thorough ESG review, our company has established a new Strategic Framework (the 'framework') for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) matters. This framework aligns with our business strategy and our mission to help individuals maximize their potential, build wealth, and achieve their savings goals. The framework consists of three strategic pillars, each with a clear connection to our business strategy. In each pillar, we have identified specific focus areas where our company can make a significant impact.\n\nWe are convinced that our new ESG framework and our long-term goals to decrease carbon emissions and promote an inclusive transition are essential for meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary duties. This approach will enable us to manage risk over the long term while contributing to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Given that transition risk represents the most immediate and impactful financial risk, we have initiated an analysis of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio. This assessment focused on investments where our company holds significant influence and control over the investment process. Preliminary reports were generated using climate-related data and metrics provided by a proprietary vendor tool. This analysis allows us to categorize the contributions of various sectors to the overall carbon footprint metrics of the asset book and pinpoint the most carbon-intensive sectors. It also enables us to identify and monitor the most carbon-heavy companies in our investment portfolio. We have also calculated the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) for the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes in our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in markets with varying degrees of development. Some markets boast diversified, service-led economies and mature financial markets, while others rely more on primary and energy-intensive industries. In emerging markets, the energy transition is likely to progress more slowly than in advanced economies. This was emphasized by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), during a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. Mr. Menon stated that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily reliant on fossil fuels for their energy needs, and it is unrealistic to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy overnight.'\n\nFor our company, this implies that while we are committed to reducing carbon emissions in our investment portfolio, we recognize the need to implement this strategy in a manner that acknowledges the unique characteristics of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition equitably. Our commitment to an inclusive transition aims to strike a balance between our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We understand the importance of coalition building in driving an inclusive transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we collaborate with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale up domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group our company has co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to generate new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."}

It enhances our understanding of climate change, enables us to plan for the future, and assists us in meeting growing regulatory requirements.\n\nIn 2022, our company conducted its initial internal climate scenario analysis exercise, employing four scenarios to represent the spectrum of potential climate change outcomes. The analysis focused on the primary regions where we operate and evaluated the impact on our balance sheet between the 2022 and 2050 timeframe. Key performance drivers and their consideration:\n\nClimate scenario analysis allows our company to model how different climate pathways might influence our customers and portfolios, particularly concerning credit losses. Under the Current Commitments scenario, we anticipate moderate credit losses due to transition risks. However, the escalating global warming will result in increasing physical risk losses in later years.\n\nAssumptions of scenarios and their relation to government policies: The assumptions for our climate stress testing exercise encompass varying levels of governmental climate policy changes, macroeconomic factors, and technological developments. However, these scenarios hinge on the development of technologies that are still uncertain, such as global hydrogen production to decarbonize aviation and shipping. For more information on the assumptions, please refer to the ESG Data Pack.\n\nPossible adjustments and adaptations of our strategies: The nature of the scenarios, our evolving capabilities, and the limitations of the analysis result in indicative outcomes of climate change headwinds, although they do not represent a direct forecast.\n\nAdvancements in climate science, data, methodology, and scenario analysis techniques will enable our company to refine its approach further. Consequently, our perspective on risk is expected to evolve over time.\n\nOur company intends to continue enhancing its capabilities for climate scenario analysis and employ the results for decision-making, primarily in relation to strategy, by utilizing the range of scenario analysis outcomes to shape our strategy across business units and regions.\n\nAt present, our company does not fully disclose the quantitative impacts of transition and physical risks, due to challenges including data limitations and evolving science and methodologies."}

Financial impact analysis of climaterelated risks primarily focuses on market and technology-related costs to reduce carbon emissions, aligning with our Net Zero Emissions by 2050 goal. This includes expenses on energy conservation or carbon reduction facilities, more expensive renewable energy or RECs, carbon credits, and additional costs due to uncertainties in the development of new energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies.\n\nPhysical risks mainly focus on growing electricity costs due to chronic climate changes, such as rising temperatures. Costs related to combating drought include expenses for building water reclamation systems, using reclaimed water, and purchasing backup water sources. For acute climate change disasters like floods and strong winds, we have already designed prevention systems into our facilities and will not be calculating their financial impact.\n\nOur company has also estimated the cost of reputation damage from failing to meet net zero emission targets. However, there is no globally recognized approach to estimate such financial impact, and these calculations are subject to uncertainty. The financial impact of a 1% revenue reduction was a consensus reached by experts after discussions and assessments.\n\nThe financial impact of climate opportunities includes reduced costs from increased energy and water use efficiency and diverse water sources, as well as additional income from providing low-carbon products and services. These may include advanced manufacturing processes, Power Management ICs (PMICs), and ultralow power (ULP) ICs.\n\nAnalysis results indicate that developing low-carbon products and services presents the greatest opportunity for positive financial impacts, as demands for such products continue to grow."}

We have examined the consequences of these risks when formulating our strategies and have also referred to the most recent physical science findings, published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to establish our own climate scenarios. Furthermore, we have incorporated potential increases in carbon emissions from expanding our operations and new facilities, as well as existing carbon reduction measures, into our evaluations to assess the potential financial implications of climate risks. Previously, we assessed climate risks based on the worst-case scenario alone. However, given the uncertainty surrounding future climate change, we have chosen to evaluate climate risks across multiple scenarios this year to help inform our internal decision-making and provide a comprehensive understanding of climate trends over the mid-to-long term.\n\nClimate Scenario Selection\nRegarding transition risks, there is a growing consensus that carbon pricing schemes will be essential for achieving net zero emissions. We have consulted the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO), a widely used IEA report, and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to conduct our climate scenario analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing serves as the foundation for us to assess the impacts of carbon pricing schemes on our operations in various countries.\n\nIn terms of physical risks, we have relied on the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) published by the IPCC in 2021 and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes. We have also adopted the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) to determine GHG emissions under various social and economic conditions.

We prioritize risks based on their potential impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being an integral part of this process.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments evaluate business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks for our organization. These risks are evaluated as part of our financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for substantial financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is consulted to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where our organization depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for substantial financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for substantial financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, our reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."}

{"instruction": "Prepared to offer guidance on risk management strategies, given your proficiency in the TCFD framework.", "input": "Answer the following questions: \n1. Managing climate-related risk and opportunities\n", "answer": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our Business Services (SI) division, for instance, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For example, we have been providing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to reduce our emissions by half compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the US, Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."}

These systems include enterprise-wide processes for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning helps us consider potential risks before major business decisions, while management reporting enables us to monitor such risks more closely as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management. If deficiencies are detected, appropriate measures can be adopted for their elimination. This coordination of processes and procedures is intended to help ensure that the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board are fully informed about significant risks in a timely manner.\n\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-oriented, integrated into the organization, and addresses both risks and opportunities. It is based on globally accepted standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO Standard 31000, and is adapted to our requirements. The frameworks connect the risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system.

Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the hierarchical level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. In a first step, assuming responsibility for a specific risk or opportunity involves choosing one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies with respect to risks are avoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance of the relevant risk. Our general response strategy with respect to opportunities is to \"seize\" the relevant opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures have to be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates by engaging in hedging activities. Regarding our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and complemented by clearly defined approval processes, assists us in identifying and responding to project risks at an early stage, even before the bidding phase. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential cases of damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure to such risks and to avoid or minimize potential losses.\n\nWe address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries and adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary.\n\nOur company constantly checks information from reputable sources, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the American and European Centers for Disease Control, and the German Robert Koch Institute, to be able to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible."}

Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisation's businesses, strategy, and financial planning.\n", "answer": "After conducting a thorough ESG review, our company has established a new Strategic Framework (the 'framework') for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues. This framework aligns with our business strategy and our mission to help individuals maximize their potential, build wealth, and achieve their financial goals. The framework consists of three strategic pillars, each with a clear connection to our business strategy. In each pillar, we have identified focus areas where our company can make a significant impact.\n\nWe are confident that our new ESG framework and our commitment to reducing carbon emissions and supporting a fair transition are essential steps for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and discharge our fiduciary duties. This approach will enable us to manage risk over the long term while contributing to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. We have initiated an analysis of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio, focusing on investments where we have control and influence over the investment process. Preliminary reports have been generated using climate-related data and metrics provided by a vendor tool. This analysis allows us to identify the sectors contributing to the carbon footprint of our asset book and pinpoint the most carbon-intensive companies. We have also calculated the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) for the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes of our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in markets with varying levels of development. Some markets have advanced, service-oriented economies and well-established financial markets, while others rely more on primary industries and energy-intensive sectors. In emerging markets, the energy transition is likely to progress more slowly than in advanced economies. This was emphasized by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of a Southeast Asian country (MAS), during a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. Mr. Menon stated that 'Emerging economies are at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to basic necessities like electricity, modern sanitation, and clean water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most emerging economies are still heavily reliant on fossil fuels for their energy needs, and it is unrealistic to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy overnight.'\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are dedicated to reducing carbon emissions in our investment portfolio, we recognize the need to implement this strategy in a manner that acknowledges the unique challenges of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition equitably. Our commitment to an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities to all our stakeholders. We understand the importance of collaboration in driving an inclusive transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we collaborate with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in Southeast Asia, to scale up domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group our company has co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to generate new ideas for scaling up investments to further the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."}

Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to the overall carbon footprint metrics of our investment portfolio and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded. It also enables us to determine and monitor the most carbon-intensive companies held in our investment portfolio. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes of our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in various markets, including highly developed economies with diversified, service-led economies and mature financial markets, and emerging markets that are more dependent on primary and energy-intensive industries. These emerging markets have a greater reliance on fossil fuels in their generation mix and less developed financial systems. The energy transition across the region is likely to proceed at a slower pace than for advanced economies.\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are committed to an objective to decarbonise our investment portfolio, we are mindful of the need to implement the strategy in a way that acknowledges the nature of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition in a fair manner. Our support for an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders.\n\nWe recognise the importance of coalition building in delivering an inclusive transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), we work with public and private sector institutions to scale domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s initiatives, including the ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group we have co-chaired since 2017, launch regular forums to catalyse new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."}
{"instruction": "Function as a TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) specialist.", "input": "Answer the following questions: \n1. Detail the influence of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization's business activities, strategic goals, and financial forecasts.\n", "answer": "After conducting a thorough review of our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices, we have formulated a new ESG Strategic Framework (the 'framework'). This framework aligns with our business strategy and our mission to help individuals maximize their potential, build wealth, and achieve their savings goals. The framework consists of three strategic pillars, each with a clear connection to our business strategy. Within these pillars, we have identified specific focus areas where our company can make a significant impact.\n\nWe are confident that our new ESG framework and our long-term goals to decrease the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio and support a fair transition are essential steps for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and discharge our fiduciary duties. This approach will gradually minimize our exposure to asset risk, including transition risk, over time, while also contributing to global decarbonization efforts. In our initial assessment, we analyzed the transition risk of our investment assets, focusing on those where we have direct control and influence over the investment process. We utilized climate-related data and metrics from a proprietary vendor tool to generate preliminary reports. These reports provide a sector-by-sector breakdown of carbon footprint metrics for our investment portfolio and pinpoint the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most susceptible to being stranded. They also enable us to identify and monitor the most carbon-heavy companies in our investment portfolio. We have also calculated the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) for our listed equity and corporate bond asset classes.\n\nOur company operates in diverse markets, including advanced economies with service-led, diversified industries and mature financial markets, and emerging markets that are more reliant on primary and energy-intensive industries. These emerging markets have a greater dependence on fossil fuels for their energy generation and less developed financial systems. The energy transition in these regions is expected to progress at a slower pace compared to advanced economies. This was emphasized by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), during a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. Mr. Menon stated that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily reliant on fossil fuels for their energy needs, and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nFor our company, this implies that while we are dedicated to the objective of decarbonizing our investment portfolio, we recognize the importance of implementing the strategy in a manner that acknowledges the unique characteristics of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition equitably. Our commitment to a fair transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We understand the significance of coalition building in driving a fair transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we collaborate with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale up domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group we have co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to generate new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."}

It enhances our awareness of climate change, enables us to prepare for the future, and assists us in meeting growing regulatory requirements. \u2013 In 2022, we conducted our initial climate scenario analysis exercise, employing four scenarios to represent the spectrum of potential climate change outcomes. The analysis focused on the key regions where our company operates and evaluated the impact on our balance sheet between the 2022 and 2050 timeframe. Key performance drivers and their consideration \u2013 Climate scenario analysis allows our company to model the potential impact of different climate pathways on our customers and investments, with a particular focus on credit losses. Under the Current Commitments scenario, we anticipate moderate levels of losses related to transition risks. However, physical risk losses will increase in later years due to rising global warming.\nAssumptions behind scenarios and government policies \u2013 The assumptions for our climate stress testing exercise include varying levels of governmental climate policy changes, macroeconomic factors, and technological developments. However, the success of these scenarios hinges on the development of uncertain technologies, such as global hydrogen production for decarbonizing aviation and shipping. For more information on the assumptions, please refer to our ESG Data Pack.\nPossible strategic adjustments and adaptations \u2013 The nature of the scenarios, our evolving capabilities, and the limitations of the analysis result in indicative outcomes of climate change risks, although they do not represent a definitive forecast. \u2013 Advancements in climate science, data, methodology, and scenario analysis techniques will help us refine our approach further. Consequently, our perspective on risk is expected to evolve over time. \u2013 Our company plans to continue enhancing our capabilities for climate scenario analysis and employ the results for decision-making, primarily in relation to strategy.

The financial analysis of climate-related risks primarily concentrates on market and technology-related costs to minimize carbon emissions, in line with our Net Zero Emissions by 2050 goal. This encompasses expenses on energy conservation or carbon reduction facilities, pricier renewable energy or RECs, carbon credits, and additional costs due to uncertainties in the development of new energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies.\n\nPhysical risks primarily focus on escalating electricity costs due to chronic climate changes, such as increasing temperatures. Costs related to combating drought include expenses for constructing water reclamation systems, utilizing reclaimed water, and purchasing backup water sources. For acute climate change disasters like floods and strong winds, we have already integrated prevention systems into our facilities and will not be calculating their financial impact.\n\nOur company has also estimated the cost of reputation damage from failing to meet net zero emission targets. However, there is no globally recognized methodology to quantify such financial impact. The financial impact of a 1% revenue reduction was a consensus reached by experts after discussions and assessments. The financial impact from climate opportunities includes reduced costs from increased energy and water use efficiency and diverse water sources, as well as additional income from providing low-carbon products and services such as 7nm or more advanced processes, Power Management ICs (PMICs), and ultralow power (ULP) ICs.\n\nAnalysis results suggest that developing low-carbon products and services presents the greatest opportunity for positive financial impacts, as demands for low-carbon products and advanced manufacturing processes continue to grow."}

We have considered the outcomes when determining the resiliency of strategies and have also referred to the latest physical science basis, published by generic organizations similar to the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to develop our own climate scenarios. In addition, we have also included potential growth in carbon emissions from expanding our operations and new facilities as well as existing carbon reduction actions into general evaluations to analyze the potential financial impacts of climate risks. In the past, we evaluated climate risks solely using the worst-case scenario, but the future of climate change is highly unpredictable. As such, we have opted to evaluate climate risks across several scenarios this year to help map out and communicate operations strategies internally and give comprehensive insights into climate trends over the mid-to-long term.\n\nClimate Scenario Selection\n\nIn terms of transition risks, there is now a global consensus that carbon pricing schemes are a necessary policy to achieve net zero emissions. We referenced a commonly used report by a global energy organization, similar to the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO) published by the IEA, and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to conduct climate scenario analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing then serves as the basis for us to evaluate the impacts of carbon pricing schemes on our locations in different countries.\n\nIn terms of physical risks, we referenced the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) published by a generic scientific body similar to the IPCC in 2021 and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes in the future. We also adopted a generic scenario framework, such as the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP), to derive GHG emissions under different social and economic landscapes. Our impact analysis on physical risks covers climate change evaluations across every region of the globe and provides detailed impact analysis to our locations and suppliers around the world through downscaling analysis."}
