{"instruction": "As a TCFD consultant, your responsibilities include providing specific recommendations for enhancing metrics and establishing new targets in the area of climate-related financial risk disclosures.", "input": "Answer the following questions: \n1. Describe the organization\u2019s processes for identifying and assessing climate- related risks \n Describe the organization\u2019s processes for managing climaterelated risks \n Elaborate on the incorporation of the company's procedures for pinpointing, evaluating, and handling climate-related risks into its comprehensive risk management strategy.\n", "answer": "Our company's Direct Operations:\nRisk management is a crucial process in our organization, encompassing all functions. We evaluate risks related to financial and market performance, operational efficiency, emergency preparedness and response, environmental compliance, and health and safety, among other areas. We prioritize risks based on their potential impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers, as well as regulatory requirements. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments evaluate domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. Additionally, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have reviewed potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. We have considered raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management discusses which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success. We also consult external stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. ISO 14001 defines an environmental aspect as an element of an organization's activities, products, or services that has or may have an impact on the environment. Our significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system. Each environmental aspect, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, is ranked from 0 through 4 based on criteria like severity, magnitude, probability, frequency, controllability, duration, employee concerns, community concerns, boundaries, business impact, and regulatory. The highest scores identify our significant impacts, which we focus on in more detail in our environmental management systems.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with global efforts to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our suppliers of raw materials. As a global organization, we rely on various suppliers for raw materials, some of which may be subject to supply constraints due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the production of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nWe assess upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nWe assess downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact.
