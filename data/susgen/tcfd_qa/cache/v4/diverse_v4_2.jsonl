Our Enterprise Risk Management program includes managing key enterprise risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments evaluate business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are assessed as part of our financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have reviewed potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. We have considered raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management discusses which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success. We also consult external stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. ISO 14001 defines an environmental aspect as an element of an organization's activities, products, or services that has or may have an impact on the environment. Our significant environmental impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system. Each environmental aspect, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, is ranked from 0 through 4 based on criteria like severity, magnitude, probability, frequency, controllability, duration, employee concerns, community concerns, boundaries, business impact, and regulatory. The highest scores identify our significant impacts, which we focus on in more detail in our environmental management systems.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our suppliers of raw materials. As a global organization, we rely on various suppliers for raw materials, some of which may be subject to supply constraints due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."}

{"instruction": "Prepared to offer guidance on risk management, drawing from your proficiency in the TCFD framework.", "input": "Answer the following questions: \n1. Managing climate-related risk and opportunities\n", "answer": "Our company does not see any significant transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our Business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed.

Handling climate-related risk and opportunities\n", "answer": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For example, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nThe collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis.

Central components of these systems consist of enterprise-wide procedures for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning enables us to recognize potential risks prior to significant business decisions, while management reporting facilitates closer monitoring of risks as our business advances. Our internal auditors regularly evaluate the sufficiency and efficiency of our risk management, and any shortcomings can be remedied through suitable measures.\n\nOur risk management strategy is all-encompassing, dynamic, and management-focused, and is embedded within our organization. It addresses both risks and opportunities. Our strategy is grounded in globally recognized frameworks, such as the COSO Framework and ISO 31000, and is customized to our company's specifications. The frameworks link our risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system.\n\nOur risk management process targets early recognition and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially impact our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is usually three years, and we employ a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities that remain after the implementation of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a systematic manner, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting typically follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues promptly.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on impact and probability, taking into account various viewpoints, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is complemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down approach ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at various management levels and are incorporated into the subsequent reporting process, if deemed relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are categorized within and for each of the departments mentioned. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. Our response strategies encompass avoidance, transfer, reduction, acceptance, and capitalizing on opportunities. For each risk or opportunity, responsibility entails the development, initiation, and monitoring of suitable response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures are specifically designed to facilitate effective risk management.\n\nOur company manages various risks, including those related to economic conditions and customer demand, project risks, and risks from the transmission of infectious agents. We closely monitor macroeconomic trends and developments in relevant industries to address the risk of economic instability and fluctuating customer demand.

Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. The first step in assuming responsibility for a risk or opportunity involves choosing one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies for risks include avoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance. Our general response strategy for opportunities is to \"seize\" the opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures must be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe have developed a range of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates through hedging activities. Regarding our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and clearly defined approval processes, helps us identify and respond to project risks at an early stage, even before the bidding phase. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure to such risks and to avoid or minimize potential losses.\n\nWe address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries and adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary.\n\nThere are global risks from the transmission of infectious agents from animals to humans, from humans to humans, and in other ways. Epidemics, pandemics, or other spread patterns, such as bioterrorism, threaten to cause high disease rates in different countries, regions, or continents. We continuously monitor information from the World Health Organization (WHO), the American and European Centers for Disease Control, the German Robert Koch Institute, and other institutions to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible."}

The evaluation of climate risks and opportunities is incorporated into our top-down and bottom-up processes, providing a comprehensive overview of our business activities. In fiscal 2020, the criteria for this climate change related top-down approach were specified in more detail based on the TCFD recommendations and are available to all business units as part of their quarterly risk management discussions.\n\nClimate change is not a standalone category within ERM, but is rather considered within the risk identification of the four areas: strategic, operational, financial, and compliance-related risks. In order to evaluate the potential climate change related net-risk for our ERM reporting, pre-ERM processes are in place. These include, for example, our environmental management system with its corresponding risk assessment of environmental impacts from our production or products.\n\nThe disclosure of risks is respectively bundled within the above-mentioned four areas and outlined in our Annual Report.

The Board recognizes the importance of senior executive involvement and holistic oversight of ESG matters material to our organization. In 2020, a Group ESG Committee was established to provide this involvement. The Committee is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and includes the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, the HR Director, and senior representatives from our business units. One of the Group ESG Committee's responsibilities is to oversee our progress towards fulfilling our commitment to report against the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In 2020, the Group ESG Committee reported to the Board through a relevant committee.\n\nThe Board acknowledges that the next 12 to 18 months are critical for the implementation of our ESG Strategic Framework and related matters, such as the development and embedding of our purpose and values, diversity and inclusion (D&I) priorities, and employee engagement activities. In early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight during this period.\n\nOur policies and procedures for managing ESG issues are outlined in our corporate Governance Manual (GGM). The GGM is subject to an annual formal content review, taking into consideration internal and external factors. Any instances of GGM non-compliance identified through annual attestations are assessed by policy owners and reported to an appropriate committee.\n\nWe believe that our new strategic ESG framework and long-term goals to decarbonize our investment portfolio and support an inclusive transition are essential for meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary obligations. This approach will reduce our exposure to asset risk, including transition risk, over time, while also contributing to global decarbonization efforts. Our Risk function conducted an initial transition risk analysis on insurance assets managed in segregated portfolios by our asset managers. This analysis focused on investments where we maintain direct control and exert influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to our overall carbon footprint metrics and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded. It also enables the identification and monitoring of the most carbon-intensive companies held in our asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of our listed equity and corporate bond asset classes.\n\nThe Board's oversight of climate change risk has been significantly strengthened. In 2020, ESG was overseen by the Board through a relevant committee. In early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established until May 2022 to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight of ESG matters (including climate change).
