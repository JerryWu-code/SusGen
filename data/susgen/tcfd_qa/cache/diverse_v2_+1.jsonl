We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our suppliers of raw materials. As a global company, we rely on various suppliers for raw materials, some of which may be subject to supply constraints due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."}

{"instruction": "Picture yourself as a seasoned professional in climate-related financial reporting, with a particular expertise in the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) framework. Your responsibilities include a comprehensive understanding of how companies can transparently report on climate-related issues under the TCFD framework's four pillars: Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Metrics & Targets. Your mission is to contribute to creating precise, informative, and insightful responses for a Q&A session aimed at improving an organization's TCFD report. For each of the following sections, please provide expert-level answers based on the fundamental aspects of TCFD disclosures:\n\nAddress the organization's short-term and long-term approaches to managing climate-related risks and opportunities. Delve into the financial consequences, plausible scenarios, and the strategic alignment with the organization's broader business strategy. Emphasize the impact on operational planning, investment decisions, and innovation projects.\n\nResponse to Question 1:\n\nManaging climate-related risk and opportunities is a crucial aspect of an organization's overall risk management strategy. The TCFD framework requires companies to disclose their approach to identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nShort-term strategies may include implementing energy efficiency measures, sourcing renewable energy, or investing in carbon offsets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These actions can help companies comply with regulations, meet stakeholder expectations, and potentially save on energy costs.\n\nLong-term strategies could involve transitioning to a low-carbon business model, investing in research and development of new technologies, or engaging in industry collaborations to address climate-related challenges. These strategies can help companies stay competitive, build resilience, and contribute to a more sustainable future.\n\nThe financial implications of climate-related risks and opportunities can be significant. For instance, extreme weather events or regulatory changes could lead to increased costs or lost revenue. Conversely, companies that effectively manage climate-related risks and opportunities can gain a competitive advantage and potentially generate new revenue streams.\n\nPlausible scenarios for climate-related risks and opportunities may include regulatory changes, technological advancements, or shifts in consumer preferences. Companies should assess the likelihood and potential impact of these scenarios and disclose their strategies for managing them.\n\nThe strategic fit of climate-related risks and opportunities into an organization's overall business strategy is essential. Companies should consider how these factors influence operational planning, investment strategies, and innovation initiatives. For example, a company that relies heavily on fossil fuels may need to invest in renewable energy or alternative business models to remain competitive in a low-carbon economy. Similarly, a company that develops climate-friendly technologies may have a strategic advantage in a world that values sustainability.", "input": "", "answer": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites.\n\nOur business focuses on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. Our strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been providing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. In this year, we managed to reduce our emissions by half compared to 2014. This program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nWe evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the U.S., Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nOur company's Water Strategy is complementary to the physical risk assessment process. Every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment, including the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. We analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively manage several risk cases to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."}
