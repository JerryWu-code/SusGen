Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being part of this process.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use a substantial amount as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is interviewed to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year.

Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner.

How do organizations manage risks and seize opportunities associated with climate change?", "input": "", "answer": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business focuses on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. Our strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization.\n\nWe are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. In this year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a benchmark year. This program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nWe evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nOur company's Water Strategy is complementary to the physical risk assessment process. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. We analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations.

Our internal auditors regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management. If deficiencies are detected, appropriate measures can be adopted for their elimination. This coordination of processes and procedures is intended to help ensure that the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board are fully informed about significant risks in a timely manner.\n\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-oriented, integrated into the organization, and addresses both risks and opportunities. It is based on globally accepted standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO Standard 31000, and is adapted to our requirements. The frameworks connect the risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system. They consider our strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of our business operations, the reliability of our financial reporting, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important.\n\nOur risk management process aims for early identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievement of our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives.

Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the hierarchical level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. In a first step, assuming responsibility for a specific risk or opportunity involves choosing one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies with respect to risks are avoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance of the relevant risk. Our general response strategy with respect to opportunities is to \"seize\" the relevant opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures have to be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates by engaging in hedging activities. Regarding our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and complemented by clearly defined approval processes, assists us in identifying and responding to project risks at an early stage, even before the bidding phase. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential cases of damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure to such risks and to avoid or minimize potential losses.\n\nWe address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries and adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary.\n\nOur company constantly checks information from relevant institutions, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the American and European Centers for Disease Control, and the German Robert Koch Institute, to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible."}

I will primarily focus on the role of governance structures and strategic planning in addressing environmental challenges.\n\nQuestion 1:\nClimate-related risks and opportunities can significantly impact an organization's business operations, strategic direction, and financial planning in several ways. First, they can influence the organization's risk profile, as extreme weather events, regulatory changes, and shifting market trends can lead to increased costs, operational disruptions, and reputational damage. Second, they can affect the organization's strategic direction, as companies may need to adapt to new market conditions, regulatory requirements, and customer preferences related to climate change. Lastly, they can impact financial planning, as organizations may need to allocate resources to mitigate climate risks, invest in low-carbon technologies, and respond to changing market dynamics.\n\nTherefore, it is crucial for organizations to disclose their climate-related risks and opportunities transparently and accurately to stakeholders, enabling them to make informed decisions about the organization's financial stability and long-term sustainability.

Kindly find below my response to your query:\n\n1. Outline the effects of climate-related risks and prospects on the organization\u2019s operations, strategic direction, and financial forecasting.\n\nThe organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning are significantly influenced by climate-related risks and opportunities. Climate risks encompass a broad spectrum, including physical risks such as extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and natural disasters, as well as transitional risks arising from regulatory changes, technological advancements, and shifting market dynamics.\n\nPhysical risks can lead to direct damages to assets and infrastructure, disrupt supply chains, and negatively impact demand for goods and services. For instance, a company with significant exposure to agriculture may face production losses due to droughts or floods, while a coastal city's real estate market could be adversely affected by sea-level rise.\n\nTransitional risks, on the other hand, can manifest in various ways, such as regulatory changes, shifts in consumer preferences, and technological advancements. For example, a company heavily reliant on fossil fuels may face regulatory pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, or may face competition from renewable energy sources.\n\nTo effectively manage these risks and opportunities, organizations need to integrate climate considerations into their business strategies, risk management frameworks, and financial planning processes. This may involve conducting climate risk assessments, setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and investing in climate-resilient infrastructure and technologies.\n\nMoreover, organizations can seize opportunities presented by the transition to a low-carbon economy, such as developing new products and services, expanding into emerging markets, and building partnerships with stakeholders.

{"instruction": "As an expert in the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) framework, I will offer a comprehensive guide on how to effectively assess and communicate climate-related risks and prospects for an organization. I will focus on the significance of governance, strategic alignment, and risk management practices in this context.\n\nFirst, let me address the influence of climate-related risks and opportunities on an organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning. Climate-related risks and opportunities can significantly impact an organization's operations, strategic direction, and financial projections. These risks and opportunities may stem from various sources, such as regulatory requirements, physical risks, transition risks, and reputational risks.\n\nPhysical risks refer to the direct consequences of climate change on an organization's assets and operations. For instance, a company with significant exposure to coastal regions may face risks from sea-level rise, storm surges, or other extreme weather events. Transition risks, on the other hand, relate to the potential financial impact of policies and regulatory measures aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A company heavily reliant on fossil fuels, for example, may face significant financial consequences if stricter regulations are enacted or if alternative energy sources become more economically viable.\n\nReputational risks are also a concern for organizations when it comes to climate-related issues. Consumers, investors, and other stakeholders are increasingly demanding greater transparency and action from companies regarding their climate-related risks and opportunities. Failure to address these concerns can result in negative publicity, loss of market share, and damage to the organization's reputation.\n\nStrategic alignment is crucial in managing climate-related risks and opportunities. Organizations need to ensure that their business strategies are consistent with the low-carbon economy and the transition to a sustainable future. This may involve investing in renewable energy, developing low-carbon products or services, or implementing energy efficiency measures.\n\nEffective risk management practices are essential in addressing climate-related risks and opportunities. Organizations should identify, assess, and prioritize these risks and opportunities, and develop strategies to mitigate, adapt, or capitalize on them. This may involve implementing risk management policies and procedures, conducting climate risk assessments, and engaging with stakeholders on climate-related issues.\n\nIn conclusion, climate-related risks and opportunities can have a profound impact on an organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning. Effective evaluation and reporting on these risks and opportunities require a strong understanding of governance, strategic alignment, and risk management practices. By addressing these factors, organizations can better manage climate-related risks and opportunities and position themselves for success in a low-carbon economy.", "input": "", "answer": "Our company's climate ambition, announced in February 2020, recognizes various climate-related risks and opportunities to embed climate into our business and culture, as well as support customers' transition to a low carbon economy.\n\nProgress made on our 2020 climate ambition announcements include achieving the target of making our own operations Net Zero Carbon, providing significant funding and financing for climate and sustainable projects, and issuing Green Bonds totaling $600 million USD.\n\nDuring 2020, climate considerations were included in existing processes and new products were launched to help customers transition to a low carbon economy.\n\nQualitative considerations related to climate were incorporated into our 2021 financial planning cycle."}

Financial impact analysis of climaterelated risks primarily focuses on market and technology-related costs to reduce carbon emissions, aligning with our Net Zero Emissions by 2050 goal. This includes expenses on energy conservation or carbon reduction facilities, more expensive renewable energy or RECs, carbon credits, and additional costs due to uncertainties in the development of new energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies.\n\nPhysical risks mainly focus on growing electricity costs due to chronic climate changes, such as rising temperatures. Costs related to combating drought include expenses for building water reclamation systems, using reclaimed water, and purchasing backup water sources. For acute climate change disasters like floods and strong winds, we have already designed prevention systems into our facilities and will not be calculating their financial impact.\n\nOur company has also estimated the cost of reputation damage from failing to meet net zero emission targets. However, there is no globally recognized approach to estimate such financial impact. The financial impact of a 1% revenue reduction was a consensus reached by experts after discussions and assessments. The estimated financial impact from climate opportunities includes reduced costs from increased energy and water use efficiency and diverse water sources, as well as additional income from providing low-carbon products and services such as advanced manufacturing processes, Power Management ICs (PMICs), and ultralow power (ULP) ICs.\n\nAnalysis results indicate that developing low-carbon products and services presents the greatest opportunity for positive financial impacts, as demands for such products continue to grow."}

In addition, we have also included potential growth in carbon emissions from expanding our business and new facilities as well as existing carbon reduction actions into general evaluations to analyze the potential financial impacts of climate risks. In the past, we evaluated climate risks solely using the worst-case scenario, but the future of climate change is highly unpredictable. As such, we have opted to evaluate climate risks across several scenarios this year to help map out and communicate operations strategies internally and give comprehensive insights into climate trends over the mid-to-long term.\n\n2. Climate Scenario Selection\nIn terms of transition risks, there is now a global consensus that carbon pricing schemes are a necessary policy to achieve net zero emissions. We referenced a commonly used report, the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO), and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to conduct climate scenario analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing then serves as the basis for us to evaluate the impacts of carbon pricing schemes on our locations in different countries.\n\n3. In terms of physical risks, we referenced the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) published by IPCC in 2021 and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes in the future.

In addition to establishing mid and long-term goals for our four major management initiatives, we conduct annual reviews and make rolling adjustments based on external factors and trends, with the objective of minimizing climate impacts through management by objectives and ensuring business continuity. In response to the increasing carbon costs associated with global low-carbon transitions, we have initiated an internal carbon pricing scheme. This carbon pricing scheme takes into account factors such as regulations, fines, market pricing, and costs of carbon reduction. This scheme incorporates carbon costs into the impact valuations of our daily reduction measures and influences our investment decisions regarding new facilities. For instance, in 2022, we implemented 684 energy conservation measures across eight categories under our energy conservation program, saving approximately 700 GWh in energy that year. Evaluations using our internal carbon pricing scheme indicate that the potential external carbon costs from carbon emission reductions amount to around NT$530 million. We strive to minimize our carbon footprint and contribute to a sustainable future. Our company continually assesses and adjusts our operations to reduce our carbon emissions and promote energy efficiency. We believe that by taking a proactive approach to carbon pricing, we can make informed decisions that benefit both our business and the environment."}
