We prioritize risks based on their impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being part of this process.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use a substantial amount as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is interviewed to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption. We use a substantial amount as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner.

{"instruction": "In light of your knowledge in TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures), please address the following inquiries:\n\n1. How do organizations manage risks and seize opportunities associated with climate change?", "input": "", "answer": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business focuses on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. Our strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization.\n\nWe are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. In this year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a benchmark year. This program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new project, which drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nWe evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nOur company's Water Strategy is complementary to the physical risk assessment process. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region. We analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively manage several risk cases to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."}

In the context of climate-related risks, ERM plays a crucial role in ensuring that an organization is adequately prepared for the potential financial impacts of climate change.\n\nTo enhance transparency in climate governance and risk management through the ERM process, consider the following steps:\n\na. Identification: Recognize and document climate-related risks, including physical risks (e.g., extreme weather events) and transition risks (e.g., regulatory changes).\n\nb. Assessment: Evaluate the likelihood and potential impact of each identified climate risk.\n\nc. Prioritization: Rank risks based on their potential financial impact and likelihood.\n\nd. Mitigation: Implement strategies to reduce the likelihood or impact of identified climate risks.\n\ne. Monitoring and Reporting: Continuously monitor and report on the effectiveness of risk management strategies and any changes in climate risks.\n\nBy following these steps, organizations can demonstrate their commitment to transparency in climate governance and risk management through their ERM process.", "input": "", "answer": "Our company has implemented and coordinated a set of risk management and control systems to support the early recognition of developments that could jeopardize our business continuity.

We will approach this as a company-wide cross-functional initiative, with participation from various business units, risk, actuarial, and government relations teams.\n\nScenario analysis will be an important area of focus as we plan to integrate it into our mainstream risk management processes during 2021 and to begin reporting findings within management information at the company and business unit levels. As we continue to explore how climate risk impacts our business in the long term, we aim to operationalize and increase the use of scenario testing. We plan to voluntarily run scenario tests emerging from regulators, such as exploratory climate risk scenarios for financial institutions in 2021.\n\nMany organizations have set targets in alignment with global climate agreements. We are in the process of assessing similar targets in respect of the carbon emissions from our investments, given their importance within our overall emissions profile, and our commitment to decarbonizing our investment portfolio.\n\nIn the interim, we continue to increase our level of ambition in relation to our own emissions footprint. This year we have set new and stretching targets for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, with the aim of becoming net carbon neutral across these two scopes by the end of 2030. More information on the environmental impact of our direct operations is available in the Environmental Impact section.\n\nDuring 2021, we will continue to scale up our engagement strategy with key policy and political stakeholders around major climate conferences, with a focus on financial sector issues to support the just transition and sustainable finance priorities, particularly in emerging markets. We recognize that the implementation of our strategic ESG framework can generate opportunities for our company. Some of these opportunities will come through our efforts to take early mitigating action against the climate risks we identify, including incorporating transition risk into investment decisions to reduce the risk of being exposed to stranded assets. Others will come through supporting an inclusive transition. The infrastructure and capital expenditure required to enable the transition represents attractive investment opportunities in many cases. For example, there is a role for institutions to both develop new products and invest in structures and mechanisms that enable a managed withdrawal from reliance on coal-powered electricity within developing economies. In response to this, we have developed several responsible investment products that channel our customers\u2019 savings towards ESG-themed investments, such as the Asia Sustainable Bond Fund recently launched by Eastspring. More information on our ESG-related investment activity is available in the Responsible Investment section.\n\nA review is underway to assess suitable targets in respect of the carbon emissions from our investment portfolio.
