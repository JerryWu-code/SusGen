Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being part of this process.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use a substantial amount as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is interviewed to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption.

Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner.

How do organizations effectively manage risks and seize opportunities associated with climate change?", "input": "", "answer": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization.\n\nWe are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. In this year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a benchmark year. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nWe evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis.

Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization.\n\nWe are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. In this year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a benchmark year. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nThe collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs.

The board of directors and senior management are responsible for overseeing the identification, assessment, and mitigation of climate risks. They ensure that risk management is integrated into the organization's overall strategy and that resources are allocated accordingly. Effective governance structures and processes enable organizations to respond proactively to climate-related risks and opportunities, ensuring long-term sustainability and resilience.", "input": "", "answer": "Our company has implemented and coordinated a set of risk management and control systems to support the early recognition of developments that could jeopardize our business continuity. These systems include enterprise-wide processes for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning helps us identify potential risks before major business decisions, while management reporting enables us to monitor such risks more closely as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management, and if deficiencies are detected, appropriate measures can be adopted for their elimination.\n\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-oriented, and is integrated into our organization. It addresses both risks and opportunities. Our approach is based on globally accepted standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO Standard 31000, and is adapted to our company's requirements. The frameworks connect our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process with our financial reporting process and internal control system. They consider our strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of our business operations, the reliability of our financial reporting, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important.\n\nOur ERM process aims for early identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially affect our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues in a timely manner.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on impact and likelihood, considering different impact perspectives. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational units mentioned. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. Our response strategies include avoidance, transfer, reduction, acceptance, and seizing opportunities. Response measures are specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe mitigate risks through various response measures, such as hedging activities for fluctuations in currency and interest rates, systematic and comprehensive project management, and appropriate insurance levels for potential damage and liability risks. We address risks of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries, and by adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if necessary.\n\nWe constantly check information from relevant institutions, such as the World Health Organization, to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible. We have established protocols for responding to such risks, including communication with employees, customers, and stakeholders, as well as implementation of necessary protective measures. Our business continuity plans include contingencies for remote work and other flexible work arrangements to ensure continuity of operations during crises."}

In addressing the first question, let's discuss how climate risk fits into an organization's risk management framework.\n\n1. Climate risk as part of an organization's risk management\n\nClimate risk encompasses various threats and opportunities that can impact an organization's financial performance, reputation, and strategic objectives. These risks can stem from both physical and transitional sources, such as extreme weather events, regulatory changes, and shifts in market trends.\n\nTo effectively manage climate risk, organizations should integrate it into their overall risk management framework. This can be achieved by:\n\na. Identifying and assessing climate risks: Organizations should identify and evaluate climate risks that are material to their business, taking into account both short-term and long-term implications.\n\nb. Establishing risk mitigation strategies: Based on the assessment of climate risks, organizations should develop strategies to mitigate or adapt to these risks. This may include implementing risk transfer mechanisms, such as insurance, or investing in climate resilience measures.\n\nc. Monitoring and reporting on climate risks: Organizations should establish processes for monitoring and reporting on climate risks, ensuring that they are transparent with stakeholders about their exposure to these risks and the actions they are taking to manage them.\n\nBy integrating climate risk into their risk management framework, organizations can better understand and address the financial, reputational, and strategic implications of climate change, while also demonstrating their commitment to climate resilience to stakeholders.", "input": "", "answer": "Our approach to managing risks and opportunities related to climate change is incorporated into our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework.

{"instruction": "As a TCFD specialist, I'd be happy to elucidate the significance of incorporating climate risks into an organization's strategic planning.\n\nFirstly, let me address the importance of climate risk in the context of risk management. Climate risks encompass a wide range of potential threats, from physical hazards such as extreme weather events and sea-level rise, to transitional risks arising from regulatory changes, technological advancements, and shifting market dynamics. By integrating climate risks into risk management, organizations can better anticipate and prepare for these threats, mitigate potential losses, and ultimately enhance their resilience.\n\nNow, let me answer the specific question regarding climate risk and organizational strategy.\n\n1. Incorporation of climate risk in organizational strategy:\n\nThe integration of climate risks into organizational strategy is crucial for several reasons. First, it enables companies to identify and assess the material climate risks that could impact their business models, operations, and financial performance. By understanding these risks, organizations can proactively manage them and develop strategies to mitigate or adapt to the associated impacts.\n\nSecond, integrating climate risks into organizational strategy allows companies to seize opportunities arising from the transition to a low-carbon economy. This could include investing in renewable energy, developing new products or services that cater to the growing demand for climate solutions, or implementing energy efficiency measures to reduce costs and improve competitiveness.\n\nLastly, demonstrating a commitment to addressing climate risks through strategic planning can help organizations build trust with stakeholders, including investors, customers, and regulators. This can lead to improved reputation, enhanced relationships, and increased access to capital and resources.\n\nIn summary, the importance of integrating climate risks into organizational strategy lies in its ability to help companies better manage risks, seize opportunities, and build trust with stakeholders.

Within each of these, specific differentiating focus areas have been identified where our company can make a meaningful impact.\n\nWe believe that the new strategic ESG framework and the long-term goals to reduce carbon emissions and support an inclusive transition are an important way for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and fulfill our fiduciary obligations. It will help us manage risk over time, while also contributing to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Recognizing that transition risk represents the nearest-term and most impactful financial risk, we have conducted an initial analysis of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio. This analysis focused on investments where our company maintains control and exerts influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool.

This point was highlighted by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of a Monetary Authority (MAS). Speaking at a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020, Mr. Menon noted that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are committed to an objective to reduce carbon emissions in our investment portfolio, we are mindful of the need to implement the strategy in a way that acknowledges the nature of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition in a fair manner. Our support for an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We recognize the importance of coalition building in delivering an inclusive transition.

Due to challenges in data sourcing and processes, there have been impacts on certain climate disclosures.\n\nWe have established methods to assess climate risks and uncover opportunities. Climate scenario analysis serves as a risk assessment tool, shedding light on the long-term consequences of transition and physical risks across our corporate and retail banking portfolios, as well as our own operations. Our sustainable finance strategy supports sustainable infrastructure and energy systems, promotes decarbonisation efforts across the real economy, and enhances investor capital through sustainable investment.\n\nOur goal is to reach net zero in our financed emissions by 2050 and in our own operations and supply chain by 2030. We aim to facilitate and provide $750bn to $1tn of sustainable finance and investment for our customers in their transition to net zero and a sustainable future.\n\nOur assessment of climate risks covers three distinct time periods: short term (up to 2025), medium term (2026 to 2035), and long term (2036 to 2050). Transition or physical climate-related issues are identified using enhanced questionnaires and scoring tools.\n\nWe support our customers in their transition through our sustainable finance and investment strategy. Our sustainable finance data dictionary includes a detailed definition of contributing activities.\n\nCertain perils, such as coastal, river, and surface water flooding, may lead to potential credit losses in our retail portfolio. Approximately 20% of our financed properties are located in London, and most are protected by various flood protection measures.\n\nWe have identified six key sectors with the highest exposure to climate transition risk: automotive, chemicals, construction and building materials, metals and mining, oil and gas, and power and utilities. We have continued to enhance our identification and assessment of climate risk within our retail mortgage portfolio, with increased investments in physical risk data and improvements to our internal risk assessment capabilities and models.\n\nOpportunities include sustainable finance, sustainable investment, and sustainable infrastructure. For a detailed breakdown of our sustainable finance progress by geography, see the ESG Data Pack.\n\nWe report our exposure to high transition risk sectors in our wholesale portfolio. Since 2020, we have expanded the questionnaire to include our largest customers in the next highest climate transition risk sectors: agriculture, industrials, real estate, and transportation.\n\nAs a result of climate scenario analysis, our largest and most impacted sectors \u2013 power and utilities, construction and building materials, and chemicals \u2013 are subject to increased levels of transition risks. Our asset management division is increasingly considering both physical and transition risks and integrating ESG and climate analysis into the investment decision-making process.\n\nTransition to net zero represents one of our strategic pillars. We aim to be net zero in our operations and supply chain by 2030 and in our financed emissions by 2050. Scenario analysis supports our strategy by assessing our position under a range of climate scenarios and helping us plan for the future and meet growing regulatory requirements.\n\nWe continue to develop our climate scenario analysis exercises to gain a more comprehensive understanding of climate headwinds, risks, and opportunities that will support our strategic planning and actions. We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of climate-related issues on financial planning, particularly the impact on financial performance and financial position. We expect to further enhance our disclosure and processes in relation to acquisitions/divestments in the medium term.\n\nClimate change poses a physical risk to the buildings we occupy as an organization, including offices, retail branches, and data centers. We use stress testing to evaluate the potential impact to our owned or leased premises. Our scenario stress test, conducted in 2022, analyzed how seven different climate change-related hazards could impact 500 of our critical and important buildings.\n\nOur Climate Solutions Partnership is a philanthropic initiative that aims to identify and remove barriers to scale for climate change solutions. We support start-up companies developing carbon-cutting technologies, nature-based solutions, renewable energy initiatives in Asia, and the WWF-led Asia Sustainable Palm Oil Links programme.\n\nDuring Board meetings, we balance discussions on the company's performance, emerging risks, and duties to shareholders while remaining conscious of responsibilities to support communities and help customers. In 2022, the Board approved an update to the thermal coal phase-out policy and the publication of an updated energy policy. We have committed to publishing our own climate transition plan in 2023."}

This carbon pricing scheme incorporates carbon costs into the impact valuations of our daily reduction measures and influences our investment decisions regarding new facilities. For instance, in 2022, we implemented 684 energy conservation measures across eight categories under our energy conservation program, saving approximately 700 GWh in energy that year. Evaluations using our internal carbon pricing scheme suggest that the potential external carbon costs from carbon emission reductions amount to around NT$530 million."}

Every year, we evaluate our progress in carbon reduction by conducting an annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory and formulating carbon reduction strategies. In 2022, our direct emissions from processes (Scope 1) accounted for 11% and were primarily from fluorinated gases and nitrous oxide. Indirect GHG emissions from purchased energy (Scope 2) accounted for 50%. Indirect GHG emissions from the value chain (Scope 3) accounted for 39%. These indirect emissions were primarily from producing raw materials, energy-related activities in the upstream, and transportation."}

Opportunities could include cost savings from energy efficiency measures or the development of new climate-related products or services.\n\n2. Medium-term risks could include transition risks, such as the shift towards a low-carbon economy, and physical risks, such as the impact of sea-level rise on infrastructure. Opportunities could include the development of new technologies or the expansion into new markets.\n\n3. Long-term risks could include the potential for stranded assets, such as fossil fuel reserves that may become uneconomic due to carbon pricing or regulatory changes. Opportunities could include the development of new business models or the expansion into emerging markets.\n\nBy providing a clear and detailed understanding of these risks and opportunities, organizations can demonstrate their resilience to climate-related challenges and their potential to capitalize on new opportunities.

For climate scenario analysis, we can run 30-year scenarios for both Physical and Transition Risk. Some aspects of our Physical Risk scenario analysis may extend to 2100.\n\nMethods used to identify material risks and opportunities: We employ a variety of tools and methodologies to evaluate Transition and Physical Climate Risk for our clients, portfolios, and our own operations. These include scenario analysis, location-based hazard and risk scores, temperature alignment scores, and Munich Re's NATHAN tool (acute physical risk impact assessments). In addition, we engage with our corporate clients to understand their transition and physical risks, as well as their plans to address climate change. In 2022, we continued to expand our knowledge of climate-related risks and significantly improved our stress testing and scenario analysis capabilities for various management scenarios.\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities recognized: We have assessed the impact of Climate Risk on our business using scenario analysis over a 30-year time horizon, which has allowed us to identify and mitigate climate risks that may emerge. Sustainability and climate change have evolved from primarily risk-based initiatives to becoming a value driver. This presents an opportunity for us to apply our market and industry expertise to advise our clients on their individual sustainability journeys. Sustainable finance represents an opportunity to both safeguard our existing business from Transition Risk and to fund our clients' transition from a high-carbon present to a low-carbon future. By supporting clients on their net zero journeys and providing further financing to clients as they adapt to be less carbon-intensive and emitting over time, we help mitigate their, and our, Transition Risk. Our goal is to generate $1 billion in Sustainable Finance income by 2025 and to mobilize $300 billion of Sustainable Finance by 2030 as measures of success. We do not disclose the impact on financial planning and performance (including proportions of income, costs, and balance sheet related to climate-related opportunities), detailed Climate Risk exposures for all sectors and geographies, or physical risk metrics.
