The objective is to elevate the caliber and reach of financial reporting.\n\nTo begin, let's discuss how climate-related risks and opportunities influence an organization's business functions, strategic objectives, and financial forecasting.\n\n1. Climate-related risks and opportunities can significantly impact an organization's core operations by introducing new challenges and opportunities that may affect its ability to generate revenue, manage costs, and maintain regulatory compliance. For instance, extreme weather events, changing regulations, and shifting market trends can all pose risks to an organization's operations. Conversely, they can also present opportunities for innovation, cost savings, and competitive differentiation.\n\n2. Climate-related risks and opportunities can also influence an organization's strategic direction by altering market conditions, customer preferences, and industry dynamics. For example, a shift towards renewable energy sources could disrupt the business model of a fossil fuel company, while it could also create new opportunities for companies that specialize in renewable energy solutions.\n\n3. Lastly, climate-related risks and opportunities can impact an organization's financial planning by requiring additional investments in risk management, research and development, and capital expenditures. For instance, a company may need to invest in new technologies to reduce its carbon footprint or face increased costs due to carbon pricing regulations.\n\nIn summary, climate-related risks and opportunities can have far-reaching consequences for an organization's operations, strategic direction, and financial planning.

We prioritize risks based on their impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being part of this process.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use a substantial amount as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is interviewed to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption. We use a substantial amount as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a substantial amount as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, our reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business focuses on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. Our strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization.\n\nWe are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. In this year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a benchmark year. This program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new project, which drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nWe evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nOur company's Water Strategy is complementary to the physical risk assessment process. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region. We analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively manage several risk cases to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

In 2020, a Group ESG Committee was established to provide senior executive involvement and holistic oversight of ESG matters material to our organization. The Committee is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and includes the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, the HR Director, and senior representatives from our business units. One of the Group ESG Committee's responsibilities is to oversee our progress towards fulfilling our commitment to report against the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In 2020, the Group ESG Committee reported to the Board through the Nomination & Governance Committee.\n\nOur policies and procedures for managing ESG issues are outlined in our Group Governance Manual (GGM). The GGM is subject to an annual formal content review, taking into consideration internal and external factors. Any instances of GGM non-compliance identified through annual attestations are assessed by policy owners and reported to the Group Audit Committee.\n\nOur company is committed to implementing our new strategic ESG framework and long-term goals to decarbonize our investment portfolio and support an inclusive transition. This approach is essential for meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary obligations. This approach will reduce our exposure to asset risk, including transition risk, over time, while also contributing to global decarbonization efforts. Our Risk function conducted an initial transition risk analysis on insurance assets managed in segregated portfolios by our asset managers. This analysis focused on investments where we maintain direct control and exert influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to our overall carbon footprint metrics and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded. It also enables the identification and monitoring of the most carbon-intensive companies held in our asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of our listed equity and corporate bond asset classes.\n\nOur Board's oversight of climate change risk has been significantly strengthened. In 2020, ESG was overseen by the Board through the Nomination & Governance Committee. In early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight of ESG matters (including climate change) until May 2022.

The Board plays a pivotal role in setting the tone for climate risk management within an organization. It is responsible for establishing the risk management framework and ensuring that the organization's climate-related risks and opportunities are identified, assessed, and managed effectively.\n\nMoreover, the Board should be well-versed in the TCFD framework and its reporting requirements, as this will enable them to provide effective oversight and ensure that the organization's disclosures are comprehensive, consistent, and forward-looking. The Board should also engage with management to understand the organization's climate risks and opportunities, as well as the strategies in place to manage them.\n\nAdditionally, the Board should ensure that the organization's climate risk management strategy aligns with its overall business strategy and risk appetite. This includes setting targets and goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, enhancing the organization's climate risk resilience, and integrating climate considerations into decision-making processes.\n\nFurthermore, the Board should establish a clear reporting line for climate-related risks and opportunities, ensuring that there is a dedicated function or team responsible for managing and reporting on these risks.

In response to your query, I will outline the role of the Board in overseeing and addressing climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\n1. The Board's Role in Monitoring and Managing Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities:\n\na. Establishing a clear mandate: The Board should set a clear expectation that climate change is a material risk and opportunity that requires active management. This can be achieved by incorporating climate-related risks and opportunities into the organization's risk management framework and strategic planning processes.\n\nb. Engaging expertise: The Board should ensure that it has access to the necessary expertise and resources to effectively address climate-related risks and opportunities. This may involve engaging external experts, as well as developing the internal capabilities required to assess and manage these issues.\n\nc. Oversight of climate-related risk assessments: The Board should oversee the process of identifying, assessing, and reporting on climate-related risks and opportunities. This may involve reviewing the organization's climate-related risk assessments, as well as the strategies and targets that have been established to address these risks and opportunities.\n\nd. Setting targets and metrics: The Board should establish comprehensive metrics and targets that align with the organization's sustainable and climate-resilient strategies. These metrics and targets should be transparent, measurable, and consistent with the TCFD framework, and should be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that they remain relevant and effective.\n\ne. Engaging stakeholders: The Board should engage with key stakeholders, including investors, regulators, and industry groups, to ensure that the organization's approach to climate change is aligned with best practices and emerging trends in this area. This may involve participating in industry initiatives, collaborating with peers, and engaging in dialogue with investors and other stakeholders to build understanding and support for the organization's climate-related strategies and targets.\n\nf. Reporting and disclosure: The Board should ensure that the organization's climate-related risks and opportunities, as well as its strategies and targets for addressing these issues, are effectively communicated to stakeholders through transparent and timely reporting and disclosure. This may involve integrating climate-related information into the organization's annual report, sustainability report, and other public disclosures, as well as engaging in dialogue with investors and other stakeholders to address any questions or concerns they may have.\n\nBy following this approach, organizations can effectively transform their approach to climate change, incorporating comprehensive metrics and targets that align with sustainable and climate-resilient strategies, and effectively managing and reporting on climate-related risks and opportunities.",

This framework is fully aligned to our business strategy and our purpose of helping people to get the most out of life, accumulate wealth, and save for their goals. The key features of our ESG framework include its three strategic pillars, which have clear alignment with our business strategy. Within each of these, specific differentiating focus areas have been identified where our company can make a meaningful impact.\n\nWe believe that the new strategic ESG framework and the long-term goals to reduce carbon emissions and support an inclusive transition are an important way for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and fulfill our fiduciary obligations. It will help us manage risk over time, while also contributing to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Recognizing that transition risk represents the nearest-term and most impactful financial risk, we have conducted an initial analysis of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio. This analysis focused on investments where our company maintains control and exerts influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to the overall carbon footprint metrics of the asset book and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors. It also enables us to determine and monitor the most carbon-intensive companies held in the asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes of our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in markets with varying levels of development. Some markets have diversified, service-led economies and mature financial markets, while others are more dependent on primary and energy-intensive industries. These emerging markets have a greater reliance on fossil fuels in their generation mix and less developed financial systems. The energy transition across the region is likely to proceed at a slower pace than for advanced economies. This point was highlighted by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of a Monetary Authority (MAS). Speaking at a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020, Mr. Menon noted that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are committed to an objective to reduce carbon emissions in our investment portfolio, we are mindful of the need to implement the strategy in a way that acknowledges the nature of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition in a fair manner. Our support for an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We recognize the importance of coalition building in delivering an inclusive transition. As a member of a Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we work with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group we have co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to catalyze new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."

Within each of these, specific focus areas have been identified where our company can make a significant impact. We will prioritize these differentiators.\n\nOur new strategic ESG framework and our long-term goals to decarbonize our investment portfolio and support an inclusive transition are crucial for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and discharge our fiduciary duties. It will help reduce our exposure to asset risk, which includes transition risk, over time, while also contributing to global decarbonization efforts. Recognizing that transition risk represents the most immediate and impactful financial risk to our company, we have conducted an initial transition risk analysis on investments where we hold significant influence. Preliminary reports were generated using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This allows for a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to the overall carbon footprint metrics of our investment portfolio and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded.

The energy transition in these regions is likely to progress at a slower pace than for advanced economies.\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are committed to an objective to decarbonize our investment portfolio, we are mindful of the need to implement the strategy in a way that acknowledges the unique characteristics of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition equitably. Our support for an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders.\n\nWe recognize the importance of coalition building in driving an inclusive transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), we collaborate with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group we have co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to catalyze new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."

To address your query, I will outline how climate-related risks and opportunities impact the organization's business operations, strategic objectives, and financial projections.\n\n1. Climate-related risks and opportunities: An in-depth analysis\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities significantly shape an organization's business landscape. To provide a clear understanding of their influence, consider the following aspects:\n\na. Business activities: Climate-related risks and opportunities can impact various aspects of an organization's operations, such as supply chain disruptions due to extreme weather events, increased costs of raw materials due to resource scarcity, or regulatory changes in response to climate policies.\n\nb. Strategic goals: Climate-related risks and opportunities can influence an organization's strategic objectives, such as the need to adapt to changing market conditions, shift business models to low-carbon alternatives, or invest in new technologies to reduce emissions.\n\nc. Financial forecasts: Climate-related risks and opportunities can have a material impact on an organization's financial projections, such as changes in revenue due to shifting market trends, increased costs of capital due to stranded assets, or potential liabilities from climate litigation.\n\nBy acknowledging and addressing these aspects, organizations can develop robust disclosures that not only meet TCFD guidelines but also provide stakeholders with valuable insights into the organization's climate-related risks and opportunities.",

This framework is fully aligned to our business strategy and our purpose of helping people to get the most out of life, accumulate wealth, and save for their goals. The key features of our ESG framework are its three strategic pillars, which have clear alignment with our business strategy. Within each of these, specific differentiating focus areas have been identified where our company can make a meaningful impact.\n\nWe believe that the new strategic ESG framework and the long-term goals to decarbonise our investment portfolio and support an inclusive transition are an important way for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and fulfill our fiduciary obligations. It will reduce our exposure to asset risk, including transition risk, over time, while also contributing to global decarbonisation efforts. Recognising that transition risk represents the nearest-term and most impactful financial risk, we have conducted an initial transition risk analysis on our investment assets. This analysis focused on investments where our company maintains direct control and exerts influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to the overall carbon footprint metrics of our investment portfolio and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded. It also enables us to determine and monitor the most carbon-intensive companies held in our investment portfolio. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of our listed equity and corporate bond asset classes.\n\nOur company operates in various markets, including highly developed economies with diversified, service-led economies and mature financial markets, and emerging markets that are more dependent on primary and energy-intensive industries. These emerging markets have a greater reliance on fossil fuels in their generation mix and less developed financial systems. The energy transition across the region is likely to proceed at a slower pace than for advanced economies. This point was highlighted by a senior official from a central bank in the region. Speaking at a financial conference, he noted that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are committed to an objective to decarbonise our investment portfolio, we are mindful of the need to implement the strategy in a way that acknowledges the nature of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition in a fair manner. Our support for an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We recognise the importance of coalition building in delivering an inclusive transition. As a member of a partnership focused on sustainable development, we work with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition.

Outline the manner in which climate-related risks and prospects influence an organization's business functions, strategic objectives, and financial forecasting.\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities can significantly impact an organization in various ways. Let me elaborate:\n\na. Business Operations: Climate-related risks can materialize in the form of extreme weather events, supply chain disruptions, and regulatory changes. For instance, a manufacturing company may face production delays due to prolonged droughts or heavy rainfall, leading to increased costs and decreased output. On the other hand, opportunities may arise from the adoption of green technologies, such as renewable energy or energy-efficient processes, which can lead to cost savings and improved sustainability.\n\nb. Strategic Direction: Climate-related risks and opportunities can influence an organization's strategic direction by altering market trends, regulatory requirements, and stakeholder expectations. For example, a company operating in the fossil fuel industry may face increasing pressure to transition towards renewable energy sources due to growing concerns over carbon emissions and their impact on the environment. Conversely, a company that focuses on green technologies may experience significant growth opportunities as more organizations adopt sustainable practices.\n\nc. Financial Planning: Climate-related risks and opportunities can have a substantial impact on an organization's financial planning. For instance, a company may need to invest in new technologies or processes to mitigate climate-related risks or capitalize on opportunities. Additionally, climate-related risks can lead to increased costs, such as insurance premiums or remediation expenses, while opportunities can result in cost savings or new revenue streams.\n\nIn conclusion, climate-related risks and opportunities can significantly impact an organization's business operations, strategic direction, and financial planning.

        "output": "Our company's Direct Operations:\nRisk management in our organization involves all functions, including assessing risks related to financial and market performance, operational performance, emergency preparedness and response, environment, health and safety compliance, and regulatory impacts. We prioritize risks based on their impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being part of this process.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use a substantial amount as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is interviewed to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption. We use a substantial amount as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a substantial amount as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, our reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites.\n\nOur business focuses on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. Our strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been providing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. In this year, we managed to reduce our emissions by half compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nWe evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the U.S., Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nOur company's Water Strategy is complementary to the physical risk assessment process. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

This framework is fully aligned to our business strategy and our purpose of helping people to get the most out of life, accumulate wealth, and save for their goals. The key features of our ESG framework include its three strategic pillars, which have clear alignment with our business strategy. Within each of these, specific differentiating focus areas have been identified where our company can make a meaningful impact.\n\nWe believe that the new strategic ESG framework and the long-term goals to reduce carbon emissions and support an inclusive transition are an important way for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and fulfill our fiduciary obligations. It will help us manage risk over time, while also contributing to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Recognizing that transition risk represents the nearest-term and most impactful financial risk, we have conducted an initial analysis of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio. This analysis focused on investments where our company maintains control and exerts influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to the overall carbon footprint metrics of the asset book and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors. It also enables us to determine and monitor the most carbon-intensive companies held in the asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes of our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in markets with varying levels of development. Some markets have diversified, service-led economies and mature financial markets, while others are more dependent on primary and energy-intensive industries. These emerging markets have a greater reliance on fossil fuels in their generation mix and less developed financial systems. The energy transition across the region is likely to proceed at a slower pace than for advanced economies. This point was highlighted by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of a Monetary Authority (MAS). Speaking at a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020, Mr. Menon noted that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are committed to an objective to reduce carbon emissions in our investment portfolio, we are mindful of the need to implement the strategy in a way that acknowledges the nature of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition in a fair manner. Our support for an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We recognize the importance of coalition building in delivering an inclusive transition. As a member of a Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we work with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group we have co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to catalyze new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."

        "instruction": "Based on your profound knowledge of the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) framework, I will outline the optimal practices for amplifying transparency and responsibility in climate-related financial reports. I will primarily concentrate on governance frameworks and strategic planning to tackle environmental issues.\n\nFirstly, let us discuss how climate-related risks and opportunities impact an organization's business functions, strategic objectives, and financial planning.\n\n1. Climate-related risks and opportunities can significantly influence an organization's core operations by introducing new challenges and opportunities that may impact its revenue, costs, and capital expenditures. For instance, extreme weather events, changes in regulations, or shifts in market trends can all have a substantial impact on an organization's financial performance.\n\n2. Strategic direction: Climate-related risks and opportunities can also influence an organization's strategic direction. For example, a company that relies heavily on fossil fuels may need to adapt its business model to remain competitive in a low-carbon economy. Similarly, a company that can effectively manage climate-related risks and seize climate-related opportunities may gain a competitive advantage.\n\n3. Financial planning: Climate-related risks and opportunities can also impact an organization's financial planning. For instance, a company may need to invest in new technologies or processes to reduce its carbon footprint and comply with regulations. Alternatively, a company may need to allocate resources to manage the risks associated with climate change, such as extreme weather events or supply chain disruptions.\n\nTo enhance transparency and accountability in climate-related financial disclosures, organizations should adopt the following best practices:\n\n1. Establish a clear governance structure for managing climate-related risks and opportunities, including a designated board committee or senior executive responsible for overseeing climate-related issues.\n\n2. Develop a climate-related risk assessment and management process that identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\n3. Integrate climate-related considerations into strategic planning and financial reporting processes.\n\n4. Disclose climate-related information in a clear, concise, and comparable manner, following the TCFD framework's recommendations.\n\n5. Engage with stakeholders, including investors, regulators, and industry groups, to build transparency and accountability around climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nBy implementing these best practices, organizations can improve their climate-related financial disclosures, enhance transparency and accountability, and better manage the risks and opportunities associated with climate change.",

For example, a company may set goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve energy efficiency, or develop new products and services that cater to the growing demand for climate solutions.\n\nc. Financial forecasts: Climate-related risks and opportunities can have a substantial impact on an organization's financial projections. For instance, the cost of complying with regulations, the value of stranded assets, or the potential revenue from new climate-related business opportunities can significantly influence an organization's financial performance.\n\nBy providing detailed and transparent disclosures about these impacts, organizations can demonstrate their understanding of climate-related risks and opportunities and their ability to manage them effectively.

This section should outline the board's commitment to addressing climate-related issues and its approach to integrating climate considerations into the organization's strategy and risk management processes.\n\nExample:\n\"Our board recognizes the importance of climate change as a material risk and opportunity that can significantly impact our business. We have established a clear mandate for the board to oversee climate change risks and opportunities and have integrated climate considerations into our strategy and risk management processes.\"\n\n1. Detailing Climate-Related Targets:\n\nNext, disclose specific climate-related targets that the organization has set to reduce its carbon footprint and mitigate climate risks. These targets should be quantifiable, time-bound, and aligned with science-based targets or industry benchmarks.\n\nExample:\n\"We have set a target to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2030 compared to our 2019 baseline. This target is in line with the Science Based Targets Initiative and reflects our commitment to contributing to the global effort to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\"\n\n1. Metrics for Measuring Progress:\n\nProvide metrics to measure the organization's progress towards achieving its climate-related targets. These metrics should be transparent, verifiable, and comparable over time.\n\nExample:\n\"We measure our greenhouse gas emissions using the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 1, 2, and 3) accounting framework. This allows us to accurately track and report our emissions across our entire value chain and assess our progress towards our emissions reduction target.\"\n\n1. Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities:\n\nIdentify and disclose climate-related risks and opportunities that could materially impact the organization's business. This section should provide a qualitative analysis of these risks and opportunities and outline the organization's strategy for managing them.\n\nExample:\n\"Climate change poses significant risks to our business, including regulatory changes, physical risks, and transition risks. We are actively addressing these risks through a multi-faceted approach that includes investing in renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, and engaging with stakeholders to better understand and manage climate-related risks.\"\n\nBy following this approach, organizations can craft effective disclosures on climate-related targets and metrics that adhere to the TCFD recommendations and provide stakeholders with valuable insights into the organization's climate change strategy and risk management processes.",

We have considered the outcomes when determining the resiliency of strategies and have also referred to the latest physical science basis, published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to develop our own climate scenarios. In addition, we have also included potential growth in carbon emissions from expanding our business and new facilities as well as existing carbon reduction actions into general evaluations to analyze the potential financial impacts of climate risks. In the past, we evaluated climate risks solely using the worst-case scenario, but the future of climate change is highly unpredictable. As such, we have opted to evaluate climate risks across several scenarios this year to help map out and communicate operations strategies internally and give comprehensive insights into climate trends over the mid-to-long term.\n\n2. Climate Scenario Selection\nIn terms of transition risks, there is now a global consensus that carbon pricing schemes are a necessary policy to achieve net zero emissions. We referenced a commonly used report, the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO), and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to conduct climate scenario analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing then serves as the basis for us to evaluate the impacts of carbon pricing schemes on our locations in different countries.\n\n3. In terms of physical risks, we referenced the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) published by IPCC in 2021 and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes in the future. We also adopted a scenario to derive GHG emissions under different social and economic landscapes.

In the short term, what climate-related risks and opportunities have been identified?\n2. How about the medium-term outlook? What climate-related risks and opportunities are anticipated?\n3. Lastly, what are the climate-related risks and opportunities that the organization foresees in the long term?\n\nBy providing answers to these questions, the organization can demonstrate its understanding of the climate-related risks and opportunities that may impact its business and financial performance. This transparency is essential for investors, regulators, and other stakeholders seeking to evaluate the organization's resilience and adaptability in the face of climate-related challenges.",

For climate scenario analysis, we can run 30-year scenarios for both Physical and Transition Risk. Some aspects of our Physical Risk scenario analysis may extend to 2100.\n\nMethods used to identify material risks and opportunities: We employ a variety of tools and methodologies to evaluate Transition and Physical Climate Risk, which we apply to our clients, portfolios, and our own operations. These include scenario analysis, location-based hazard and risk scores, temperature alignment scores, and Munich Re's NATHAN tool (acute physical risk impact assessments). In addition, we engage with our corporate clients to understand their transition and physical risks, as well as their plans to prepare for climate change. In 2022, we continued to expand our comprehension of climate-related risks and significantly fortified our stress testing and scenario analysis capabilities for a range of management scenarios that are more probable.\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities recognized: We have assessed the impact of Climate Risk on our business using scenario analysis over a 30-year time horizon, which has allowed us to identify and mitigate climate risks that may materialize. Sustainability and climate change have evolved from being primarily risk-based initiatives to becoming a value driver. This presents us with an opportunity to leverage our market and industry knowledge to counsel our clients on their individual sustainability journeys. Sustainable finance represents an opportunity to both safeguard our existing business from Transition Risk and to fund our clients' transition from a high-carbon present to a low-carbon future. By supporting clients on their net zero journeys and providing further finance to clients as they adapt to be less carbon intensive and emitting over time, we help mitigate their, and our, Transition Risk. Our objective is to generate $1 billion in Sustainable Finance income by 2025 and to mobilize $300 billion of Sustainable Finance by 2030 as indicators of success. We do not fully disclose the impact on financial planning and performance (including proportions of income, costs, and balance sheet related to climate-related opportunities), detailed Climate Risk exposures for all sectors and geographies, or physical risk metrics. Data limitations, and our plans to address these, are discussed in greater detail in the report.\n\nSignificant concentrations of credit exposure to carbon-related assets: We have disclosed our exposures to high-carbon sectors, which includes the expected credit losses on these balances as well as the maturity profiles associated with them. Our exposure to high-carbon sectors comprises 14.4% of our loan balances. We aim to become net zero in our financed emissions by 2050, with interim 2030 targets for our highest emitting sectors. In 2022, we made progress towards this goal and set out to measure, manage, and reduce emissions starting with our most carbon-intensive sectors, in accordance with our net zero roadmap."

We plan to optimize our office and branch network, continually maximizing efficiency while leveraging clean and renewable power where appropriate. In line with our commitment to the global corporate renewable initiative, RE100, we aim to meet our own challenging targets.\n\nSuppliers:\nThrough our Supplier Charter, we encourage our suppliers to support and promote environmental protection and manage and mitigate environmental risks. In 2022, we launched a global project to define strategies to address emissions related to Scope 3 Category 1, 2, 4, and 6. Our internal targets cover reducing our emissions related to upstream transportation and distribution and business travel by 28% against 2019 levels over the next seven years.

In July 2022, we formalised this further and appointed our inaugural Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), to help drive our sustainability agenda and bring together our existing Sustainable Finance, Sustainability Strategy, and Net Zero Programme Management, teams.\nScenarios used:\nIn 2022, our company engaged a third-party vendor to begin development of bespoke internal modelling capabilities to provide greater transparency. We assessed the impact on our corporate client portfolio based on three IEA scenarios and three Phase 2 scenarios from the NGFS. Our company also assessed the impact of sea-level rises under various Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios to explore the Physical Risk impact on our residential mortgage portfolio over short and long-term time horizons for internal risk management purposes.\nImpact of climate-related risks and opportunities on business strategy:\nOur company is working to reduce our exposure to high carbon emitting activities and is supporting clients in these industries to transition to lower carbon technologies. Our sustainable finance priorities, including new emerging products such as sustainable deposits, carbon trading and ESG Advisory, and dedicated transition frameworks, are a robust response to transition risks in the short term, strengthening our resilience towards a 2\u00b0C or lower transition scenario."

We prioritize risks based on their impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being part of this process.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use a substantial amount as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is interviewed to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption. We use a substantial amount as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a substantial amount as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, our reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization.\n\nWe are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. In this year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a benchmark year. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nWe evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nOur company's Water Strategy is complementary to the physical risk assessment process. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. We analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers.

This may include the implementation of climate-related targets, the integration of climate considerations into strategic planning, and the establishment of a climate risk management function.\n\nThirdly, the Board should promote transparency and disclosure of climate-related information to stakeholders. This can be achieved through the adoption of the TCFD framework, which provides a standardized approach for reporting climate-related financial information.\n\nLastly, the Board should ensure that the organization's climate-related targets are aligned with its long-term sustainable business strategy. This may involve setting science-based targets, which are aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, or developing targets that are consistent with the organization's business model and value proposition.\n\nIn conclusion, the Board plays a vital role in monitoring and managing climate-related risks and opportunities. By adopting a comprehensive approach that includes the establishment of clear understanding, robust systems and processes, transparency, and alignment with long-term sustainable business strategy, organizations can effectively transform their approach to climate risk management and align with sustainable and climate-resilient strategies.",

The Board recognizes the importance of the next 12 to 18 months for the implementation of our ESG Strategic Framework and related matters, such as our purpose and values, diversity and inclusion priorities, and employee engagement activities.\n\nThe Board has established a Group ESG Committee to provide senior executive involvement and holistic oversight of ESG matters. The Committee is chaired by our CFO and COO and includes our Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, HR Director, and senior representatives from our business units. One responsibility of the Group ESG Committee is to oversee our progress towards reporting against the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nOur policies and procedures for managing ESG issues are outlined in our Group Governance Manual (GGM). The GGM is subject to annual review and sets standards for managing potential ESG issues across the company. Any instances of non-compliance with the GGM identified through annual attestations are assessed by policy owners and reported to the Group Audit Committee.\n\nWe believe that our new strategic ESG framework and long-term goals are essential for meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary obligations. This approach will reduce our exposure to asset risk, including transition risk, over time, while also contributing to global decarbonization efforts.\n\nOur Risk function conducted an initial transition risk analysis on investments managed by our asset managers. This analysis focused on investments where we have control and can exert influence over the investment process. Preliminary reports were generated using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This analysis facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to our overall carbon footprint metrics and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors and companies.\n\nThe Board's oversight of climate change risk has been significantly strengthened. The Board oversees ESG matters (including climate change) through a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group until May 2022. A Board Risk Committee workshop was held to evaluate the climate change risks facing the company, discuss transition and physical risk concepts, and review potential Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)."

This framework is fully aligned to our business strategy and our purpose of helping people to get the most out of life, accumulate wealth, and save for their goals. The key features of our ESG framework include its three strategic pillars, which have clear alignment with our business strategy. Within each of these, specific differentiating focus areas have been identified where our company can make a meaningful impact.\n\nWe believe that the new strategic ESG framework and the long-term goals to reduce carbon emissions and support an inclusive transition are an important way for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and fulfill our fiduciary obligations. It will help us manage risk over time, while also contributing to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Recognizing that transition risk represents the nearest-term and most impactful financial risk, we have conducted an initial analysis of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio. This analysis focused on investments where our company maintains control and exerts influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to the overall carbon footprint metrics of the asset book and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors. It also enables us to determine and monitor the most carbon-intensive companies held in the asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes of our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in markets with varying levels of development. Some markets have diversified, service-led economies and mature financial markets, while others are more dependent on primary and energy-intensive industries. These emerging markets have a greater reliance on fossil fuels in their generation mix and less developed financial systems. The energy transition across the region is likely to proceed at a slower pace than for advanced economies. This point was highlighted by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of a Monetary Authority (MAS). Speaking at a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020, Mr. Menon noted that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are committed to an objective to reduce carbon emissions in our investment portfolio, we are mindful of the need to implement the strategy in a way that acknowledges the nature of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition in a fair manner. Our support for an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We recognize the importance of coalition building in delivering an inclusive transition. As a member of a Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we work with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group we have co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to catalyze new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."

While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are committed to an objective to decarbonise our investment portfolio, we are mindful of the need to implement the strategy in a way that acknowledges the nature of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition in a fair manner. Our support for an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We recognise the importance of coalition building in delivering an inclusive transition. As a member of a partnership focused on sustainable development, we work with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The partnership\u2019s regional hub, whose Steering Group we have co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to catalyse new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."

In 2022, we carried out our initial in-house climate scenario analysis exercise, employing four scenarios to represent the spectrum of potential climate outcomes. This analysis took into account the key regions where we operate and evaluated the impact on our balance sheet between the 2022 and 2050 timeframe.\n\nKey performance drivers and their consideration:\nClimate scenario analysis allows us to model the potential impact of different climate pathways on our customer base and investment portfolios, particularly in terms of credit losses. Under the Current Commitments scenario, we anticipate moderate levels of losses associated with transition risks. However, physical risk losses are expected to increase in later years due to rising global warming.\n\nGovernment policies and scenario assumptions:\nOur climate stress testing exercise incorporates varying levels of governmental climate policy changes, macroeconomic factors, and technological developments. However, the success of these scenarios hinges on the development of uncertain technologies, such as global hydrogen production for decarbonizing aviation and shipping. For more information on the assumptions, please refer to the ESG Data Pack.\n\nAdaptation and evolution of our strategies:\nThe nature of the scenarios, our evolving capabilities, and the limitations of the analysis result in indicative outcomes of climate change headwinds, although they do not represent a direct forecast.

What is the function of management in evaluating and addressing climate-related risks and prospects?\n\nManagement plays a pivotal role in identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks and opportunities. They establish the organization's climate change strategy, set targets, and allocate resources accordingly. Moreover, they monitor and report on the progress towards achieving these targets, while also integrating climate considerations into day-to-day operations and decision-making processes. This proactive approach enables management to effectively mitigate climate risks and capitalize on opportunities, ensuring long-term sustainability and resilience for the organization.",

        "instruction": "As an expert in the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) framework, I will offer a comprehensive guide on how to efficiently assess and communicate climate-related risks and prospects for an organization. This discussion will focus on the significance of governance, strategic alignment, and risk management practices in this context.\n\nFirstly, let me address the climate-related risks and opportunities that the organization has identified across various time horizons: short term, medium term, and long term.\n\n1. In the short term, the organization may face risks such as extreme weather events, regulatory changes, and supply chain disruptions. Opportunities could include cost savings from energy efficiency measures or the development of new climate-related products or services.\n\n2. Medium-term risks could include transition risks, such as the shift towards a low-carbon economy, and physical risks, such as the impact of sea-level rise on infrastructure. Opportunities could include the development of new technologies or the expansion into new markets.\n\n3. Long-term risks could include the potential for stranded assets, such as fossil fuel reserves that may become uneconomic due to carbon pricing or regulatory changes. Opportunities could include the development of new business models or the expansion into emerging markets.\n\nBy providing a clear and detailed understanding of these risks and opportunities, organizations can demonstrate their resilience to climate-related challenges and their potential to capitalize on new opportunities. This information is essential for investors, lenders, and other stakeholders who are seeking to understand the organization's exposure to climate-related risks and its potential to benefit from the transition to a low-carbon economy.",

Some aspects of our Physical Risk scenario analysis may extend to 2100.\n\nMethods used to identify material risks and opportunities: We employ a variety of tools and methodologies to evaluate Transition and Physical Climate Risk for our clients, portfolios, and our own operations. These include scenario analysis, location-based hazard and risk scores, temperature alignment scores, and Munich Re's NATHAN tool (acute physical risk impact assessments). In addition, we engage with our corporate clients to understand their transition and physical risks, as well as their plans to address climate change. In 2022, we continued to expand our knowledge of climate-related risks and significantly improved our stress testing and scenario analysis capabilities for various management scenarios.\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities recognized: We have assessed the impact of Climate Risk on our business using scenario analysis over a 30-year time horizon, which has allowed us to identify and mitigate climate risks that may emerge. Sustainability and climate change have evolved from primarily risk-based initiatives to becoming a value driver. This presents an opportunity for us to apply our market and industry expertise to advise our clients on their individual sustainability journeys. Sustainable finance represents an opportunity to both safeguard our existing business from Transition Risk and to fund our clients' transition from a high-carbon present to a low-carbon future. By supporting clients on their net zero journeys and providing further financing to clients as they adapt to be less carbon-intensive and emitting over time, we help mitigate their, and our, Transition Risk. Our goal is to generate $1 billion in Sustainable Finance income by 2025 and to mobilize $300 billion of Sustainable Finance by 2030 as measures of success. We do not disclose the impact on financial planning and performance (including proportions of income, costs, and balance sheet related to climate-related opportunities), detailed Climate Risk exposures for all sectors and geographies, or physical risk metrics. Data limitations, and our plans to address these, are discussed in greater detail in the report.\n\nSignificant concentrations of credit exposure to carbon-related assets: We have disclosed our exposures to high-carbon sectors, which includes the expected credit losses on these balances as well as the maturity profiles associated with them. Our exposure to high-carbon sectors comprises 14.4% of our loan balances. We aim to become net zero in our financed emissions by 2050, with interim 2030 targets for our highest emitting sectors. In 2022, we made progress towards this goal and set out to measure, manage, and reduce emissions, starting with our most carbon-intensive sectors, in accordance with our net zero roadmap."

They can include extreme weather events, regulatory changes, and shifts in market sentiment. For instance, a company may face increased insurance premiums due to frequent flooding or face reputational damage due to negative publicity surrounding its carbon footprint.\n\nMedium-term risks and opportunities:\nThese risks and opportunities may materialize within 1-5 years. They can include physical risks, such as sea-level rise or more frequent extreme weather events, and transition risks, such as the shift to a low-carbon economy. For example, a company that heavily relies on fossil fuels may face significant financial consequences as the world moves towards renewable energy sources.\n\nLong-term risks and opportunities:\nThese risks and opportunities may materialize beyond 5 years. They can include existential risks, such as climate change leading to the collapse of ecosystems and the extinction of species, and opportunities related to the development of new technologies and markets. For instance, a company that invests in renewable energy research and development may be well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for clean energy solutions.\n\nBy carefully evaluating and reporting on these climate-related risks and opportunities, organizations can demonstrate their commitment to transparency and sustainability, which can help build trust with investors, regulators, and other stakeholders.",

In response to your inquiry, I will elucidate how an organization integrates the recognition, assessment, and mitigation of climate-related risks into its comprehensive risk management approach.\n\n1. Describe the process through which the organization recognizes, assesses, and manages climate-related risks as an integral component of its overall risk management strategy.\n\nBy acknowledging and acknowledging the significance of climate-related risks, organizations can effectively integrate them into their risk management framework. This may involve the following steps:\n\na. Identification: Recognizing and acknowledging climate-related risks through various sources, such as internal and external data, industry trends, and regulatory requirements.\n\nb. Evaluation: Assessing the potential impact, likelihood, and time horizon of climate-related risks, as well as their interconnections with other risks.\n\nc. Mitigation: Implementing strategies to reduce the likelihood and severity of climate-related risks, such as risk transfer, risk avoidance, and risk reduction through process improvements or investments in climate resilience.\n\nd. Reporting: Regularly disclosing climate-related risks and the organization's response to these risks in accordance with TCFD recommendations and regulatory requirements.\n\nBy adhering to this process, organizations can effectively manage climate-related risks and contribute to a more transparent and sustainable financial system.",

        "input": "",
        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business focuses on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. Our strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization.\n\nWe are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. In this year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a benchmark year. This program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nWe evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nOur company's Water Strategy is complementary to the physical risk assessment process. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. We analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. We preventively manage several risk cases to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis.

The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our water strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in a certain country has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low, due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business focuses on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. Our strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization.\n\nWe are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. In this year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a benchmark year. This program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on industry experience. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new project, which drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nWe evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety and natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, and hurricanes, on an annual basis. The analysis is based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other regions are exposed to storms or hurricanes.

        "instruction": "As a TCFD specialist, I'd be happy to elucidate the significance of incorporating climate risks into an organization's strategic planning.\n\nFirstly, let me address the importance of climate risks in the context of risk management. Climate risks encompass a broad range of potential threats, from physical hazards such as extreme weather events and sea-level rise, to transition risks arising from regulatory changes, technological advancements, and shifting market dynamics. By integrating climate risks into risk management, organizations can better understand and prepare for these threats, ultimately enhancing their resilience and ability to adapt to a changing climate.\n\nNow, let me answer the specific question regarding climate risk incorporation:\n\nQuestion 1: Incorporation of climate risk in risk management\n\nThe integration of climate risks into an organization's risk management framework is crucial for several reasons. First, it enables the organization to identify, assess, and prioritize climate risks, allowing for informed decision-making and resource allocation. Second, it helps the organization to develop strategies for managing and mitigating climate risks, ensuring that it is well-positioned to respond to potential threats. Lastly, it contributes to the organization's overall sustainability and long-term viability, as it demonstrates a commitment to addressing climate risks and contributing to a low-carbon economy.",

This framework is fully aligned to our business strategy and our purpose of helping people to get the most out of life, accumulate wealth, and save for their goals. The key features of our ESG framework include its three strategic pillars, which have clear alignment with our business strategy. Within each of these, specific differentiating focus areas have been identified where our company can make a meaningful impact.\n\nWe believe that the new strategic ESG framework and the long-term goals to reduce carbon emissions and support an inclusive transition are an important way for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and fulfill our fiduciary obligations. It will help us manage risk over time, while also contributing to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Recognizing that transition risk represents the nearest-term and most impactful financial risk, we have conducted an initial analysis of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio. This analysis focused on investments where our company maintains control and exerts influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to the overall carbon footprint metrics of the asset book and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors. It also enables us to determine and monitor the most carbon-intensive companies held in the asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes of our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in markets with varying levels of development. Some markets have diversified, service-led economies and mature financial markets, while others are more dependent on primary and energy-intensive industries. These emerging markets have a greater reliance on fossil fuels in their generation mix and less developed financial systems. The energy transition across the region is likely to proceed at a slower pace than for advanced economies. This point was highlighted by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of a Central Bank (CB), speaking at a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. Mr. Menon noted that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are committed to an objective to reduce carbon emissions in our investment portfolio, we are mindful of the need to implement the strategy in a way that acknowledges the nature of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition in a fair manner. Our support for an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We recognize the importance of coalition building in delivering an inclusive transition. As a member of a Sustainable Development Partnership (SDP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we work with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group we have co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to catalyze new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."

I will primarily focus on the role of governance structures and strategic planning in addressing environmental challenges.\n\nQuestion 1:\nClimate-related risks and opportunities can significantly impact an organization's business operations, strategic direction, and financial planning in several ways. First, they can influence the organization's risk profile, as extreme weather events, regulatory changes, and shifting market trends can lead to increased costs, operational disruptions, and reputational damage. Second, they can affect the organization's strategic direction, as companies may need to adapt to new market conditions, regulatory requirements, and customer preferences related to climate change. Lastly, they can impact financial planning, as organizations may need to allocate resources to mitigate climate risks, invest in low-carbon technologies, and respond to changing market dynamics.\n\nTherefore, it is crucial for organizations to disclose their climate-related risks and opportunities transparently and accurately to stakeholders, enabling them to make informed decisions about the organization's financial stability and long-term sustainability. This can be achieved through the adoption of the TCFD framework, which provides a standardized approach for reporting climate-related financial information. By implementing the TCFD framework, organizations can enhance their transparency, accountability, and overall preparedness for addressing climate-related risks and opportunities.",

In response to your inquiry, I will:\n\n1. Disclose the organization's Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions encompassing Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if relevant, Scope 3, outlining the associated risks related to these emissions.\n\nIn essence, organizations need to adopt a more holistic and forward-thinking approach to climate risk management. This involves not only measuring and reporting their GHG emissions in accordance with the TCFD framework but also setting ambitious targets to reduce these emissions and align with a low-carbon future.\n\nTo begin, it is crucial for organizations to accurately quantify and disclose their Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if applicable, Scope 3 GHG emissions. Scope 1 emissions represent direct emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the organization. Scope 2 emissions stem from the purchase of electricity, heat, or steam. Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions from sources not owned or controlled by the reporting organization but result from the organization's activities.\n\nBy acknowledging and addressing these emissions, organizations can identify and mitigate the associated risks, such as regulatory compliance, reputational damage, and potential physical risks to their operations. Moreover, by setting ambitious targets to reduce these emissions, organizations can demonstrate their commitment to climate action and position themselves as leaders in their industries.\n\nIn conclusion, the TCFD framework provides a robust and globally recognized framework for organizations to disclose climate-related financial information. By adopting a comprehensive approach to climate risk management, organizations can not only meet their reporting obligations but also future-proof their businesses and contribute to a more sustainable and climate-resilient economy.",

This involves the following steps:\n\n1. Identification: The organization must first recognize and acknowledge the existence of climate-related risks. This can be achieved through various means, such as monitoring regulatory requirements, staying informed about industry trends, and engaging with stakeholders.\n\n2. Assessment: Once identified, the organization must evaluate the potential impact of these risks on its operations, financial statements, and reputation. This assessment should be conducted in a systematic and consistent manner, taking into account both the likelihood and severity of the risks.\n\n3. Management: The organization must then implement measures to mitigate or adapt to these risks. This may involve a combination of risk transfer mechanisms, such as insurance, and risk reduction strategies, such as implementing energy efficiency initiatives or developing contingency plans.\n\nThe successful integration of climate change risk management processes into the organization's overall risk management system can be achieved through the following steps:\n\n1. Establishing a clear line of responsibility for climate change risk management within the organization.\n2. Developing a climate change risk management policy that aligns with the organization's strategic objectives and is consistent with the TCFD recommendations.\n3. Implementing a climate change risk assessment framework that is integrated into the organization's existing risk management processes.\n4. Providing training and resources to employees to ensure they are equipped to identify and manage climate change risks.\n5. Regularly reviewing and updating the organization's climate change risk management processes to ensure they remain effective in the face of evolving risks and regulatory requirements.\n\nBy integrating climate change risk management processes into the organization's overall risk management system, companies can effectively mitigate climate-related issues and position themselves as leaders in the transition to a low-carbon economy.",

Since 2020, we have rolled out the questionnaire to include our largest customers in the next highest climate transition risk sectors: agriculture, industrials, real estate, and transportation.\n\nAs a result of climate scenario analysis, our largest and most impacted sectors \u2013 power and utilities, construction and building materials, and chemicals \u2013 are subject to increased levels of transition risks. Our asset management division is increasingly considering both physical and transition risks and integrating ESG and climate analysis into the investment decision-making process.\n\nTransition to net zero represents one of our strategic pillars. We aim to be net zero in our operations and supply chain by 2030 and in our financed emissions by 2050. Scenario analysis supports our strategy by assessing our position under a range of climate scenarios and helping us plan for the future and meet growing regulatory requirements.\n\nWe continue to develop our climate scenario analysis exercises to have a more comprehensive understanding of climate headwinds, risks, and opportunities that will support our strategic planning and actions. We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of climate-related issues on financial planning, particularly the impact on financial performance and financial position. We expect to further enhance our disclosure and processes in relation to acquisitions/divestments in the medium term.\n\nClimate change poses a physical risk to the buildings we occupy as an organization, including offices, retail branches, and data centers. We use stress testing to evaluate the potential impact to our owned or leased premises. Our scenario stress test, conducted in 2022, analyzed how seven different climate change-related hazards could impact 500 of our critical and important buildings.\n\nOur Climate Solutions Partnership is a philanthropic initiative that aims to identify and remove barriers to scale for climate change solutions. We support start-up companies developing carbon-cutting technologies, nature-based solutions, renewable energy initiatives in Asia, and the WWF-led Asia Sustainable Palm Oil Links programme.\n\nDuring Board meetings, we balance discussions on the company's performance, emerging risks, and duties to shareholders while remaining conscious of responsibilities to support communities and help customers. In 2022, the Board approved an update to the thermal coal phase-out policy and the publication of an updated energy policy. We have committed to publishing our own climate transition plan in 2023."

Kindly find below my response to your query:\n\n1. Outline the effects of climate-related risks and prospects on the organization\u2019s operations, strategic direction, and financial forecasting.\n\nThe organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning are significantly influenced by climate-related risks and opportunities. Climate risks encompass a broad spectrum, including physical risks such as extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and natural disasters, as well as transitional risks arising from regulatory changes, technological advancements, and shifting market dynamics.\n\nPhysical risks can lead to direct damages to assets and infrastructure, disrupt supply chains, and negatively impact demand for goods and services. For instance, a company with significant exposure to agriculture may face production losses due to droughts or floods, while a coastal city's real estate market could be adversely affected by sea-level rise.\n\nTransitional risks, on the other hand, can manifest in various ways, such as regulatory changes, shifts in consumer preferences, and technological advancements. For example, a company heavily reliant on fossil fuels may face regulatory pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, or may face competition from renewable energy sources.\n\nTo effectively manage these risks and opportunities, organizations need to integrate climate considerations into their business strategies, risk management frameworks, and financial planning processes. This may involve conducting climate risk assessments, setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and investing in climate-resilient infrastructure and technologies.\n\nMoreover, organizations can seize opportunities presented by the transition to a low-carbon economy, such as developing new products and services, expanding into emerging markets, and building partnerships with stakeholders. By proactively addressing climate-related risks and opportunities, organizations can enhance their resilience, competitiveness, and long-term sustainability.",

It enhances our understanding of climate change, enables us to plan for the future, and helps us meet our growing regulatory requirements.\n\nIn 2022, we carried out our initial internal climate scenario analysis exercise, employing four scenarios to represent the spectrum of potential climate outcomes. This analysis took into account the key regions where we operate and assessed the impact on our balance sheet between the 2022 and 2050 timeframe. Key performance drivers and their consideration:\n\nClimate scenario analysis allows us to model how different climate pathways might impact our customer base and investment portfolios, particularly in terms of credit losses. Under the Current Commitments scenario, we anticipate moderate levels of losses related to transition risks. However, physical risk losses will increase in later years due to the rise in global warming.\n\nAssumptions underlying scenarios and government policies: The assumptions for our climate stress testing exercise encompass varying levels of governmental climate policy changes, macroeconomic factors, and technological developments. However, these scenarios hinge on the development of uncertain technologies, such as global hydrogen production for decarbonizing aviation and shipping. For more information on the assumptions, please refer to our ESG Data Pack.\n\nPotential shifts in our strategies and adaptations: The nature of the scenarios, our evolving capabilities, and the limitations of the analysis result in indicative outcomes of climate change headwinds, although they are not a definitive forecast.\n\nAdvancements in climate science, data, methodology, and scenario analysis techniques will help us refine our approach further. Consequently, our perspective on risk is expected to evolve over time.\n\nOur company intends to continue enhancing our capabilities for climate scenario analysis and employ the results for decision-making, particularly in relation to strategy, by utilizing the range of scenario analysis outcomes to shape our strategy across business and regions.\n\nAt present, we do not fully disclose the impacts of transition and physical risk quantitatively due to transitional challenges, including data limitations and evolving science and methodologies."

        "instruction": "As an expert in the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) framework, I will offer a comprehensive guide on how to effectively assess and communicate climate-related risks and prospects for an organization. I will focus on the significance of governance, strategic alignment, and risk management practices in this context.\n\nFirst, let me address the influence of climate-related risks and opportunities on an organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning. Climate-related risks and opportunities can significantly impact an organization's operations, strategic direction, and financial projections. These risks and opportunities may stem from various sources, such as regulatory requirements, physical risks, transition risks, and reputational risks.\n\nPhysical risks refer to the direct consequences of climate change on an organization's assets and operations. For instance, a company with significant exposure to coastal regions may face risks from sea-level rise, storm surges, or other extreme weather events. Transition risks, on the other hand, relate to the potential financial impact of policies and regulatory measures aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A company heavily reliant on fossil fuels, for example, may face significant financial consequences if stricter regulations are enacted or if alternative energy sources become more economically viable.\n\nReputational risks are also a concern for organizations when it comes to climate-related issues. Consumers, investors, and other stakeholders are increasingly demanding greater transparency and action from companies regarding their climate-related risks and opportunities. Failure to address these concerns can result in negative publicity, loss of market share, and damage to the organization's reputation.\n\nStrategic alignment is crucial in managing climate-related risks and opportunities. Organizations need to ensure that their business strategies are consistent with the low-carbon economy and the transition to a sustainable future. This may involve investing in renewable energy, developing low-carbon products or services, or implementing energy efficiency measures.\n\nEffective risk management practices are essential in addressing climate-related risks and opportunities. Organizations should identify, assess, and prioritize these risks and opportunities, and develop strategies to mitigate, adapt, or capitalize on them. This may involve implementing risk management policies and procedures, conducting climate risk assessments, and engaging with stakeholders on climate-related issues.\n\nIn conclusion, climate-related risks and opportunities can have a profound impact on an organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning. Effective evaluation and reporting on these risks and opportunities require a strong understanding of governance, strategic alignment, and risk management practices. By addressing these factors, organizations can better manage climate-related risks and opportunities and position themselves for success in a low-carbon economy.",

Detail the organization's procedures for recognizing and evaluating climate-related risks.\n\nTo begin, organizations should establish a clear understanding of their climate-related risks by implementing the following steps:\n\na. Identify: Conduct a comprehensive assessment of the organization's operations, supply chain, and business model to recognize climate-related risks. This may include physical risks such as extreme weather events, transition risks related to regulatory changes, and reputational risks associated with climate issues.\n\nb. Assess: Evaluate the potential impact, likelihood, and time horizon of identified climate-related risks. This information will be crucial in setting targets and establishing metrics to manage and report on these risks.\n\nc. Prioritize: Rank climate-related risks based on their potential impact on the organization's financial performance and strategic objectives. This prioritization will inform the selection of key performance indicators (KPIs) and targets for reporting climate impacts.\n\nd. Monitor: Continuously monitor and update the organization's climate-related risk assessment to ensure that disclosures remain accurate and relevant. This may involve the use of scenario analysis and stress testing to evaluate the potential financial implications of different climate scenarios.\n\n2. Establish a clear reporting framework for climate-related metrics and targets.\n\nTo effectively communicate climate-related risks and opportunities to stakeholders, organizations should establish a clear reporting framework for climate-related metrics and targets. This may include:\n\na. Aligning with TCFD recommendations: Organizations should consider the TCFD's recommendations when selecting and reporting climate-related metrics and targets. This will help ensure that disclosures are consistent with industry best practices and are easily comparable across organizations.\n\nb. Setting science-based targets: Organizations should consider setting science-based targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction in line with the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This will demonstrate the organization's commitment to addressing climate risks and contributing to a low-carbon economy.\n\nc. Establishing KPIs and targets: Organizations should establish key performance indicators (KPIs) and targets for climate-related metrics, such as greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, and water usage. These KPIs and targets should be aligned with the organization's strategic objectives and should be regularly reported to stakeholders.\n\nd. Ensuring data quality and transparency: Organizations should ensure that the data used to report climate-related metrics and targets is accurate, reliable, and transparent. This may involve the use of external verification or assurance services to validate reported data.\n\n3. Implement processes for managing and reporting on climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nTo effectively manage and report on climate-related risks and opportunities, organizations should implement the following processes:\n\na. Integrate climate considerations into decision-making: Climate considerations should be integrated into the organization's decision-making processes at all levels, from strategic planning to day-to-day operations.\n\nb. Establish a climate risk management function: Organizations should establish a climate risk management function responsible for managing and reporting on climate-related risks and opportunities. This function may be part of the organization's risk management, sustainability, or investor relations team.\n\nc. Engage stakeholders: Organizations should engage stakeholders, including investors, regulators, and industry peers, in the reporting and management of climate-related risks and opportunities. This may involve the use of industry initiatives, such as the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project), to facilitate stakeholder engagement and reporting.\n\nd. Continuously improve: Organizations should continuously improve their approach to managing and reporting on climate-related risks and opportunities.

This includes expenses on energy conservation or carbon reduction facilities, more expensive renewable energy or RECs, carbon credits, and additional costs due to uncertainties in the development of new energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies.\n\nPhysical risks mainly focus on growing electricity costs due to chronic climate changes, such as rising temperatures. Costs related to combating drought include expenses for building water reclamation systems, using reclaimed water, and purchasing backup water sources. For acute climate change disasters like floods and strong winds, we have already designed prevention systems into our facilities and will not be calculating their financial impact.\n\nOur company has also estimated the cost of reputation damage from failing to meet net zero emission targets. However, there is no globally recognized approach to estimate such financial impact. The financial impact of a 1% revenue reduction was a consensus reached by experts after discussions and assessments.

In the past, we evaluated climate risks solely using the worst-case scenario, but the future of climate change is highly unpredictable. As such, we have opted to evaluate climate risks across several scenarios this year to help map out and communicate operations strategies internally and give comprehensive insights into climate trends over the mid-to-long term.\n\n2. Climate Scenario Selection\nIn terms of transition risks, there is now a global consensus that carbon pricing schemes are a necessary policy to achieve net zero emissions. We referenced a commonly used report, the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO), and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to conduct climate scenario analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing then serves as the basis for us to evaluate the impacts of carbon pricing schemes on our locations in different countries.\n\n3. In terms of physical risks, we referenced the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) published by IPCC in 2021 and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes in the future. We also adopted a scenario to derive GHG emissions under different social and economic landscapes. Our impact analysis on physical risks covers climate change evaluations across every region of the globe and provides detailed impact analysis to our locations and suppliers around the world through downscaling analysis."

Governance: Establish a clear line of authority and accountability for climate-related risks and opportunities within the organization. This may involve designating a senior executive as the chief sustainability officer or creating a climate risk committee.\n\nb. Identification: Regularly assess and monitor climate-related risks and opportunities through a systematic and rigorous process. This may include the use of scenario analysis, stress testing, and other tools to evaluate the potential impact of various climate-related events on the organization's operations, financial condition, and reputation.\n\nc. Risk assessment: Evaluate the likelihood and potential consequences of climate-related risks and opportunities, and prioritize actions based on their materiality and potential impact.\n\nd. Risk mitigation: Implement strategies to mitigate climate-related risks and capitalize on opportunities. This may involve investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency initiatives, or the development of climate-resilient infrastructure.\n\ne. Reporting: Regularly report on climate-related risks and opportunities to stakeholders, including investors, regulators, and the public. This may involve the use of the TCFD framework to provide transparent and comparable information on the organization's climate-related risks and opportunities, as well as its strategies for addressing these issues.\n\nBy following this approach, organizations can not only meet the requirements of the TCFD framework but also demonstrate their commitment to addressing climate-related risks and opportunities in a strategic and effective manner.",

In response to your inquiry, I will discuss the way management evaluates and manages climate-related risks and prospects.\n\n1. Management's approach to assessing and addressing climate-related risks and opportunities:\n\nTo begin with, it is essential for organizations to recognize and understand the climate-related risks and opportunities that may impact their business operations, strategy, and financial performance. This can be achieved through a comprehensive assessment of their climate-related risks and opportunities, which may include physical risks (e.g., extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and natural disasters), transition risks (e.g., regulatory changes, technological advancements, and shifts in market preferences), and reputational risks (e.g., negative publicity, stakeholder pressure, and brand damage).\n\nOnce identified, management should prioritize these risks and opportunities based on their potential materiality, likelihood, and time horizon. This prioritization will inform the organization's risk management strategy, which may include risk avoidance, risk reduction, risk transfer, or risk acceptance.\n\nMoreover, organizations can leverage climate-related data to inform their strategic decision-making process. For instance, they can use climate data to identify potential growth opportunities in emerging markets or industries that are less exposed to climate-related risks. Additionally, they can employ climate modeling to assess the potential impact of climate-related risks on their supply chain, infrastructure, and other critical assets.\n\nIn conclusion, the TCFD framework offers a valuable framework for organizations to disclose and manage climate-related risks and opportunities. By integrating climate-related data into their decision-making process, organizations can enhance their strategic agility, resilience, and long-term sustainability.",

These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use a substantial amount as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is interviewed to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption. We use a substantial amount as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a substantial amount as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, our reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be.

In response to the inquiries below, I will outline:\n\n1. The organization\u2019s procedures for recognizing and evaluating climate-related risks:\n   Organizations should establish a systematic approach to identifying and assessing climate-related risks. This may involve conducting a materiality assessment to determine which risks pose the greatest threat to the organization\u2019s financial stability and business operations. Climate-related risks can manifest in various forms, such as physical risks (e.g., extreme weather events) and transition risks (e.g., regulatory changes).\n\n2. The organization\u2019s procedures for addressing and mitigating climate-related risks:\n   Organizations must develop a strategy to manage climate-related risks. This may include implementing risk mitigation measures, such as investing in renewable energy sources or adopting energy efficiency practices. Additionally, organizations may need to engage in dialogue with stakeholders, including regulators, industry associations, and NGOs, to address climate-related risks collectively.\n\n3. The integration of the organization\u2019s climate-related risk identification, assessment, and management processes within its broader risk management framework:\n   Organizations should integrate climate-related risks into their overall risk management framework. This can be achieved by aligning climate-related risks with the organization\u2019s risk appetite and risk tolerance. Additionally, organizations may need to update their risk management policies, procedures, and systems to account for climate-related risks. By doing so, organizations can ensure that they are adequately prepared for the financial, operational, and reputational implications of climate-related risks.",

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business focuses on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. Our strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization.\n\nWe are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. In this year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a benchmark year. This program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nWe evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nOur company's Water Strategy is complementary to the physical risk assessment process. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. We analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers.

Strategic planning helps us consider potential risks before major business decisions, while management reporting enables us to monitor such risks more closely as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management. If deficiencies are detected, appropriate measures can be adopted for their elimination. This coordination of processes and procedures is intended to help ensure that the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board are fully informed about significant risks in a timely manner.\n\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-oriented, integrated into the organization, and addresses both risks and opportunities. It is based on globally accepted standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO Standard 31000, and is adapted to our requirements. The frameworks connect the risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system. They consider our strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of our business operations, the reliability of our financial reporting, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important.\n\nOur risk management process aims for early identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievement of our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing control measures.

The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed regarding potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational units mentioned above. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the hierarchical level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. In a first step, assuming responsibility for a specific risk or opportunity involves choosing one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies with respect to risks are avoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance of the relevant risk. Our general response strategy with respect to opportunities is to \"seize\" the relevant opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures have to be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates by engaging in hedging activities. Regarding our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and complemented by clearly defined approval processes, assists us in identifying and responding to project risks at an early stage, even before the bidding phase. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential cases of damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure to such risks and to avoid or minimize potential losses.\n\nWe address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries and adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary.\n\nThere are worldwide risks from the transmission of infectious agents from animals to humans, from humans to humans, and in other ways. Epidemic, pandemic, or other spread patterns such as bioterrorism threaten to cause high disease rates in different countries, regions, or continents. We constantly check information from reputable sources, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the American and European Centers for Disease Control, and the German Robert Koch Institute, to be able to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible."

This framework is fully aligned to our business strategy and our purpose of helping people to get the most out of life, accumulate wealth, and save for their goals. The key features of our ESG framework include its three strategic pillars, which have clear alignment with our business strategy. Within each of these, specific differentiating focus areas have been identified where our company can make a meaningful impact.\n\nWe believe that the new strategic ESG framework and the long-term goals to reduce carbon emissions and support an inclusive transition are an important way for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and fulfill our fiduciary obligations. It will help us manage risk over time, while also contributing to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Recognizing that transition risk represents the nearest-term and most impactful financial risk, we have conducted an initial analysis of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio. This analysis focused on investments where our company maintains control and exerts influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to the overall carbon footprint metrics of the asset book and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors. It also enables us to determine and monitor the most carbon-intensive companies held in the asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes of our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in various markets with varying levels of development. Some markets have diversified, service-led economies and mature financial markets, while others are more dependent on primary and energy-intensive industries. These emerging markets have a greater reliance on fossil fuels in their generation mix and less developed financial systems. The energy transition across the region is likely to proceed at a slower pace than for advanced economies. This point was highlighted by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of a Monetary Authority (MA), speaking at a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. Mr. Menon noted that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are committed to an objective to reduce carbon emissions in our investment portfolio, we are mindful of the need to implement the strategy in a way that acknowledges the nature of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition in a fair manner. Our support for an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We recognize the importance of coalition building in delivering an inclusive transition. As a member of a Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we work with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group we have co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to catalyze new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."

        "instruction": "Based on your profound knowledge of the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) framework, I will outline the optimal practices for enhancing transparency and accountability in climate-related financial reporting. I will primarily focus on the role of governance structures and strategic planning in addressing environmental challenges.\n\nFirstly, it is essential to recognize the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on an organization's business operations, strategic direction, and financial planning.\n\n1. Climate-related risks and opportunities can significantly influence an organization's financial performance and strategic objectives. For instance, extreme weather events, regulatory changes, and technological advancements can pose risks to an organization's assets, revenue streams, and supply chains. Conversely, they can also present opportunities for innovation, cost savings, and new markets.\n\n2. To effectively manage these risks and opportunities, organizations must integrate climate considerations into their governance structures and strategic planning processes. This can involve establishing a clear climate risk management policy, appointing a responsible executive or board member, and setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions or increasing renewable energy usage.\n\n3. Organizations should also assess and disclose the potential financial impact of climate-related risks and opportunities in their financial statements and reports. This can help investors and other stakeholders make informed decisions about the organization's financial stability and long-term sustainability.\n\n4. Effective climate risk management and reporting requires ongoing monitoring, assessment, and adaptation. Organizations should regularly review and update their climate risk management policies and strategies in response to changing market conditions, regulatory requirements, and stakeholder expectations.\n\n5. Transparent and accurate climate-related financial disclosures can help build trust and confidence with investors and other stakeholders, and can contribute to a more sustainable and resilient financial system.\n\n6. In conclusion, the TCFD framework provides a valuable framework for enhancing transparency and accountability in climate-related financial disclosures.

Due to challenges in data sourcing and processes, there have been impacts on certain climate disclosures.\n\nWe have established methods for identifying and assessing climate risks. Climate scenario analysis serves as a risk assessment tool, providing insights on the long-term effects of transition and physical risks across our corporate and retail portfolios, as well as our own operations. Our sustainable finance strategy supports sustainable infrastructure and energy systems, promotes decarbonisation efforts across the real economy, and enhances investor capital through sustainable investment.\n\nOur goal is to achieve net zero in our financed emissions by 2050 and in our own operations and supply chain by 2030. We aim to facilitate $750bn to $1tn of sustainable finance and investment for our customers in their transition to net zero and a sustainable future.\n\nOur assessment of climate risks covers three distinct time periods: short term (up to 2025), medium term (2026 to 2035), and long term (2036 to 2050). Transition or physical climate-related issues are assessed using enhanced questionnaires and scoring tools.\n\nWe support our customers in their transition through our sustainable finance and investment strategy. Our sustainable finance data dictionary includes a detailed definition of contributing activities.\n\nCertain perils, such as coastal, river, and surface water flooding, may drive potential credit losses in our retail portfolio. Approximately 20% of our financed properties are located in London, and most are protected by various flood protection measures.\n\nWe have identified six key sectors with the highest exposure to climate transition risk: automotive, chemicals, construction and building materials, metals and mining, oil and gas, and power and utilities. We have continued to improve our identification and assessment of climate risk within our retail mortgage portfolio, investing in physical risk data and enhancing our internal risk assessment capabilities and models.\n\nOpportunities include sustainable finance, sustainable investment, and sustainable infrastructure. For a detailed breakdown of our sustainable finance progress by geography, see the ESG Data Pack.\n\nWe report our exposure to high transition risk sectors in our wholesale portfolio. Since 2020, we have expanded our questionnaire to include our largest customers in the next highest climate transition risk sectors: agriculture, industrials, real estate, and transportation.\n\nAs a result of climate scenario analysis, our largest and most impacted sectors \u2013 power and utilities, construction and building materials, and chemicals \u2013 are subject to increased levels of transition risks. Our asset management division is increasingly considering both physical and transition risks and integrating ESG and climate analysis into the investment decision-making process.\n\nTransition to net zero represents one of our strategic pillars. We aim to be net zero in our operations and supply chain by 2030 and in our financed emissions by 2050. Scenario analysis supports our strategy by assessing our position under a range of climate scenarios and helping us plan for the future and meet growing regulatory requirements.\n\nWe continue to develop our climate scenario analysis exercises to have a more comprehensive understanding of climate headwinds, risks, and opportunities that will support our strategic planning and actions. We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of climate-related issues on financial planning, particularly the impact on financial performance and financial position. We expect to further enhance our disclosure and processes in relation to acquisitions/divestments in the medium term.\n\nClimate change poses a physical risk to the buildings we occupy as an organization, including offices, retail branches, and data centers. We use stress testing to evaluate the potential impact to our owned or leased premises. Our scenario stress test, conducted in 2022, analyzed how seven different climate change-related hazards could impact 500 of our critical and important buildings.\n\nOur Climate Solutions Partnership is a philanthropic initiative that aims to identify and remove barriers to scale for climate change solutions. We support start-up companies developing carbon-cutting technologies, nature-based solutions, renewable energy initiatives in Asia, and the WWF-led Asia Sustainable Palm Oil Links programme.\n\nDuring Board meetings, we balance discussions on the company's performance, emerging risks, and duties to shareholders while remaining conscious of responsibilities to support communities and help customers. In 2022, the Board approved an update to the thermal coal phase-out policy and the publication of an updated energy policy. We have committed to publishing our own climate transition plan in 2023."

Outline the effects of climate-related risks and prospects on the organization\u2019s operations, decision-making, and financial modeling.\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities can significantly influence an organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning in various ways. Here are some potential impacts:\n\na. Physical risks: Extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and other climate-related phenomena can directly affect an organization's assets and operations. For instance, a utility company may face increased maintenance costs due to more frequent storms, or an agricultural business may experience crop losses due to droughts.\n\nb. Transition risks: The shift towards a low-carbon economy can expose organizations to risks related to regulatory changes, technological advancements, and reputational damage. For example, a coal miner may face stranded assets if carbon pricing policies make coal-fired power generation uneconomical.\n\nc. Reputational risks: Climate change is a pressing issue, and organizations that fail to address it adequately may face negative publicity and loss of customer trust. Conversely, those that demonstrate strong climate action can gain a competitive advantage.\n\nd. Opportunities: Climate-related risks and opportunities can also present new business opportunities. For instance, a renewable energy company may benefit from growing demand for clean energy, or a business that offers climate-resilient solutions can capitalize on the need for adaptation.\n\ne. Financial planning: Climate-related risks and opportunities can impact an organization's financial planning in various ways, such as increased costs, revenue opportunities, and regulatory compliance requirements. It is essential for organizations to consider these factors when developing their financial plans.\n\nOverall, understanding the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on an organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning is crucial for effective decision-making and long-term sustainability.",

To begin, let's address the following queries:\n\n1. Delineate the climate-related risks and prospects that the organization has recognized over the short, medium, and long term.\n\nIn other words, as a TCFD expert, I will guide you on how to identify and address climate risks and opportunities that your organization faces in the short, medium, and long term. This includes recognizing potential threats, such as physical risks from extreme weather events or transition risks from regulatory changes, as well as opportunities, such as cost savings from energy efficiency or new business opportunities in the low-carbon economy. By providing transparent and comprehensive reporting on these risks and opportunities, organizations can enhance their resilience and competitiveness in the face of climate-related challenges.",
        "input": "",
        "output": "In compliance with the TCFD framework, members of our ESG Committee identify and evaluate climate change risks and response measures every two years on behalf of our company to uncover potential crises and opportunities. In 2022, we added one transition risk (relating to renewable energy regulations and procurement) and one opportunity (improving company reputation) and removed one physical risk (higher natural disaster insurance premium). The top three risks are net zero emissions, impact on company reputation, and uncertainties in the development of new energy saving/carbon reduction technologies. The top three opportunities are developing low-carbon products and services/increasing energy efficiency in customer products, driving low-carbon manufacturing, and improving company reputation.\n\nTransition risks, such as Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) commitments and company reputation, were previously considered short-term and mid-term risks, but have now been changed to mid-term and long-term risks, respectively. Opportunities, such as increasing fabric energy efficiency and promoting low-carbon green manufacturing, were modified from short-term to mid-term risks."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Our company conducts financial impact analysis on the top three risks and opportunities related to climate and transition, formulating strategies in line with TCFD recommendations. Financial impact analysis of climaterelated risks primarily focuses on market and technology-related costs to reduce carbon emissions, aligning with our Net Zero Emissions by 2050 goal. This includes expenses on energy conservation or carbon reduction facilities, more expensive renewable energy or RECs, carbon credits, and additional costs due to uncertainties in the development of new energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies.\n\nPhysical risks mainly focus on growing electricity costs due to chronic climate changes, such as rising temperatures. Costs related to combating drought include expenses for building water reclamation systems, using reclaimed water, and purchasing backup water sources. For acute climate change disasters like floods and strong winds, we have already designed prevention systems into our facilities and will not be calculating their financial impact.\n\nOur company has also estimated the cost of reputation damage from failing to meet net zero emission targets. However, there is no globally recognized approach to estimate such financial impact. The financial impact of a 1% revenue reduction was a consensus reached by experts after discussions and assessments. The estimated financial impact from climate opportunities includes reduced costs from increased energy and water use efficiency and diverse water sources, as well as additional income from providing low-carbon products and services such as advanced manufacturing processes, Power Management ICs (PMICs), and ultralow power (ULP) ICs.\n\nAnalysis results indicate that developing low-carbon products and services presents the greatest opportunity for positive financial impacts, as demands for such products continue to grow."

        "output": "1. In compliance with TCFD recommendations, our company has evaluated the impact of various greenhouse gas (GHG) emission controls on our operations and the supply chain for certain transition and physical risks. We have considered the outcomes when determining the resiliency of strategies and have also referred to the latest physical science basis, published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to develop our own climate scenarios. In addition, we have also included potential growth in carbon emissions from expanding our business and new facilities as well as existing carbon reduction actions into general evaluations to analyze the potential financial impacts of climate risks. In the past, we evaluated climate risks solely using the worst-case scenario, but the future of climate change is highly unpredictable. As such, we have opted to evaluate climate risks across several scenarios this year to help map out and communicate operations strategies internally and give comprehensive insights into climate trends over the mid-to-long term.\n\n2. Climate Scenario Selection\nIn terms of transition risks, there is now a global consensus that carbon pricing schemes are a necessary policy to achieve net zero emissions. We referenced a commonly used report, the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO), and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to conduct climate scenario analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing then serves as the basis for us to evaluate the impacts of carbon pricing schemes on our locations in different countries.\n\n3. In terms of physical risks, we referenced the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) published by IPCC in 2021 and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes in the future. We also adopted a scenario to derive GHG emissions under different social and economic landscapes. Our impact analysis on physical risks covers climate change evaluations across every region of the globe and provides detailed impact analysis to our locations and suppliers around the world through downscaling analysis."

In response to the increasing carbon costs associated with global low-carbon transitions, we have initiated an internal carbon pricing scheme. This carbon pricing scheme takes into account factors such as regulations, fines, market pricing, and costs of carbon reduction. This scheme incorporates carbon costs into the impact valuations of our daily reduction measures and influences our investment decisions regarding new facilities. For instance, in 2022, we implemented 684 energy conservation measures across eight categories under our energy conservation program, saving approximately 700 GWh in energy that year. Evaluations using our internal carbon pricing scheme indicate that the potential external carbon costs from carbon emission reductions amount to around NT$530 million. We strive to minimize our carbon footprint and contribute to a sustainable future.

This discussion will focus on the significance of governance, strategic alignment, and risk management practices.\n\nFirst, let's address the climate-related risks and opportunities that the organization has recognized over various time horizons:\n\n1. Short term: What are the immediate risks and opportunities that the business faces due to climate-related events or trends? For instance, extreme weather conditions, regulatory changes, or shifts in market demand could impact the organization's financial performance in the near term.\n2. Medium term: What are the mid-term risks and opportunities that the company may encounter as a result of climate-related factors? These could include technological advancements, changing customer preferences, or evolving regulatory requirements that could influence the organization's competitive landscape and financial position in the medium term.\n3. Long term: What are the long-term risks and opportunities that the business may face due to climate-related issues? These could include the transition to a low-carbon economy, emerging technologies, or geopolitical shifts that could significantly impact the organization's strategic direction and financial prospects in the long term.\n\nBy carefully evaluating and reporting on these climate-related risks and opportunities, organizations can demonstrate their commitment to transparency and sustainability, which is increasingly important to investors, regulators, and other stakeholders.",

For climate scenario analysis, we can run 30-year scenarios for both Physical and Transition Risk. Some elements of our Physical Risk scenario analysis can also extend to 2100.\n\nMethods used to identify material risks and opportunities: We utilize a range of tools and methodologies to assess Transition and Physical Climate Risk, which we apply to our clients, portfolios, and our own operations. These include scenario analysis, location-based hazard and risk scores, temperature alignment scores, and Munich Re's NATHAN tool (acute physical risk impact assessments). In addition, we engage with our corporate clients to understand their transition and physical risks, as well as their plans to prepare for climate change. In 2022, we continued to enhance our understanding of climate-related risks and significantly strengthened our stress testing and scenario analysis abilities for a range of management scenarios that are more plausible.\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities recognized: We have assessed the impact of Climate Risk on our business using scenario analysis over a 30-year time horizon, which has enabled us to identify and mitigate climate risks which may manifest. Sustainability and climate change have moved from being predominantly risk-based initiatives to becoming a value driver. This gives us an opportunity to deploy our market and industry knowledge to advise our clients on their individual sustainability journeys. Sustainable finance is an opportunity to both defend our existing business from Transition Risk and to fund our clients' transition from a high-carbon present to a low-carbon future. Through supporting clients on their net zero journeys and providing further finance to clients as they adapt to be less carbon intensive and emitting over time, we help mitigate their, and our, Transition Risk. Our aim to achieve Sustainable Finance income of $1 billion by 2025 and to mobilize $300 billion of Sustainable Finance by 2030 are measures of this success. We do not fully disclose impacts on financial planning and performance (including proportions of income, costs, and balance sheet related to climate-related opportunities), detailed Climate Risk exposures for all sectors and geographies, or physical risk metrics. Data limitations, and our plans to mitigate these, are discussed in greater detail in the report.\n\nSignificant concentrations of credit exposure to carbon-related assets: We have disclosed our exposures to high-carbon sectors, which includes the expected credit losses on these balances as well as the maturity profiles associated with them. Our exposure to high-carbon sectors makes up 14.4% of our loan balances. We aim to become net zero in our financed emissions by 2050, with interim 2030 targets for our highest emitting sectors. In 2022, we made progress towards this goal and set out to measure, manage, and reduce emissions starting with our most carbon-intensive sectors, in line with our net zero roadmap.
