        "answer": "Our company's Direct Operations:\nRisk management in our organization involves all functions, including assessing risks related to financial and market performance, operational performance, emergency preparedness and response, environment, health and safety compliance, and regulatory impacts. We prioritize risks based on their impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being part of this process.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is interviewed to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, our reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

We have reviewed potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. We have considered raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management discusses which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success. We also consult external stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. ISO 14001 defines an environmental aspect as an element of an organization's activities, products, or services that has or may have an impact on the environment. Our significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system. Each environmental aspect, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, is ranked from 0 through 4 based on criteria like severity, magnitude, probability, frequency, controllability, duration, employee concerns, community concerns, boundaries, business impact, and regulatory. The highest scores identify our significant impacts, which we focus on in more detail in our environmental management systems.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our suppliers of raw materials. As a global company, we rely on various suppliers for raw materials, some of which may be subject to supply constraints due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

        "input": "Answer the following questions: \n1. Managing climate-related risk and opportunities\n",
        "answer": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the U.S., Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our Siemens Water Tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

For example, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nThe collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the US, Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our water strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our Siemens Water Tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low, due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

Key components of these systems include enterprise-wide processes for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning helps us identify potential risks prior to major business decisions, while management reporting enables us to monitor risks more closely as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly assess the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management, and any deficiencies can be addressed through appropriate measures.\n\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-oriented, and is integrated into our organization. It addresses both risks and opportunities. Our approach is based on globally accepted standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO 31000, and is adapted to our company's requirements. The frameworks connect our risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system.\n\nOur risk management process aims for early identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially affect our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues in a timely manner.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on impact and likelihood, considering different perspectives, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizations mentioned. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. Our response strategies include avoidance, transfer, reduction, acceptance, and seizing opportunities. For each risk or opportunity, responsibility involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures are specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nOur company addresses various risks, including those related to economic activity and customer demand, project risks, and risks from the transmission of infectious agents. We closely monitor macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries to address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand. We maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure and avoid or minimize potential losses. We constantly check information from relevant institutions to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible."

Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the hierarchical level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. In a first step, assuming responsibility for a specific risk or opportunity involves choosing one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies with respect to risks are avoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance of the relevant risk. Our general response strategy with respect to opportunities is to \"seize\" the relevant opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures have to be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates by engaging in hedging activities. Regarding our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and complemented by clearly defined approval processes, assists us in identifying and responding to project risks at an early stage, even before the bidding phase. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential cases of damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure to such risks and to avoid or minimize potential losses.\n\nWe address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries and adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary.\n\nThere are worldwide risks from the transmission of infectious agents from animals to humans, from humans to humans, and in other ways. Epidemic, pandemic, or other spread patterns such as bioterrorism threaten to cause high disease rates in different countries, regions, or continents. We constantly check information from the World Health Organization (WHO), the American and European Centers for Disease Control, the German Robert Koch Institute, and other institutions to be able to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible."

One of the Group ESG Committee's responsibilities is to oversee our progress towards fulfilling our commitment to report against the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In 2020, the Group ESG Committee reported to the Board through the Nomination & Governance Committee.\n\nThe Board recognizes that the next 12 to 18 months are critical for the implementation of our ESG Strategic Framework and related matters, such as the development and embedding of our purpose and values, diversity and inclusion (D&I) priorities, and employee engagement activities. In early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight during this period.\n\nOur policies and procedures for managing ESG issues are outlined in our Group Governance Manual (GGM). The GGM is subject to an annual formal content review, taking into consideration internal and external factors. Any instances of GGM non-compliance identified through annual attestations are assessed by policy owners and reported to the Group Audit Committee.\n\nOur company believes that our new strategic ESG framework and long-term goals to decarbonize our investment portfolio and support an inclusive transition are essential for meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary obligations. This approach will reduce our exposure to asset risk, including transition risk, over time, while also contributing to global decarbonization efforts. Our Risk function conducted an initial transition risk analysis on insurance assets managed in segregated portfolios by our asset managers. This analysis focused on investments where we maintain direct control and exert influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to our overall carbon footprint metrics and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded. It also enables the identification and monitoring of the most carbon-intensive companies held in our asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of our listed equity and corporate bond asset classes.\n\nThe Board's oversight of climate change risk has been significantly strengthened. In 2020, ESG was overseen by the Board through the Nomination & Governance Committee. In early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established until May 2022 to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight of ESG matters (including climate change). A Board Risk Committee workshop was held to evaluate the climate change risks facing our organization, discuss transition and physical risk concepts, and review potential Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)."

        "answer": "Following our ESG review, we have developed a new ESG Strategic Framework (the 'framework'). This framework is fully aligned to our business strategy and our purpose of helping people to get the most out of life, accumulate wealth, and save for their goals. The key features of our ESG framework include its three strategic pillars, which have clear alignment with our business strategy. Within each of these, specific differentiating focus areas have been identified where we believe our company can make a meaningful impact.\n\nWe believe that the new strategic ESG framework and the long-term goals to reduce carbon emissions and support an inclusive transition are an important way for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and fulfill our fiduciary obligations. It will help us manage risk over time, while also contributing to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Recognizing that transition risk represents the nearest-term and most impactful financial risk, we have conducted an initial analysis of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio. This analysis focused on investments where our company maintains control and exerts influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to the overall carbon footprint metrics of the asset book and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors. It also enables us to determine and monitor the most carbon-intensive companies held in the asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes of our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in markets with varying levels of development. Some markets have diversified, service-led economies and mature financial markets, while others are more dependent on primary and energy-intensive industries. These emerging markets have a greater reliance on fossil fuels in their generation mix and less developed financial systems. The energy transition across the region is likely to proceed at a slower pace than for advanced economies. This point was highlighted by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). Speaking at a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020, Mr. Menon noted that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are committed to an objective to reduce carbon emissions in our investment portfolio, we are mindful of the need to implement the strategy in a way that acknowledges the nature of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition in a fair manner. Our support for an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We recognize the importance of coalition building in delivering an inclusive transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we work with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group our company has co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to catalyze new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."

        "answer": "Over the next three years, we will work to strengthen management of climate risk across our organization. We will approach this as a company-wide cross-functional initiative, with participation from our asset owner and asset manager business units, risk, actuarial, and government relations teams.\n\nScenario analysis will be an important area of focus as we plan to integrate it into our mainstream risk management processes during 2021 and to begin reporting findings within management information at the company and business unit levels. As we continue to explore how climate risk impacts our business in the long term, we aim to operationalize and increase the use of scenario testing. We plan to voluntarily run scenario tests emerging from regulators, such as exploratory climate risk scenarios for financial institutions in 2021.\n\nMany organizations have set targets in alignment with global climate agreements. We are in the process of assessing similar targets in respect of the carbon emissions from our investments, given their importance within our overall emissions profile, and our commitment to decarbonizing our investment portfolio.\n\nIn the interim, we continue to increase our level of ambition in relation to our own emissions footprint. This year we have set new and stretching targets for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, with the aim of becoming net carbon neutral across these two scopes by the end of 2030. More information on the environmental impact of our direct operations is available in the Environmental Impact section.\n\nDuring 2021, we will continue to scale up our engagement strategy with key policy and political stakeholders around major climate conferences, with a focus on financial sector issues to support the just transition and sustainable finance priorities, particularly in emerging markets. We recognize that the implementation of our strategic ESG framework can generate opportunities for our organization. Some of these opportunities will come through our efforts to take early mitigating action against the climate risks we identify, including incorporating transition risk into investment decisions to reduce the risk of being exposed to stranded assets. Others will come through supporting an inclusive transition. The infrastructure and capital expenditure required to enable the transition represents attractive investment opportunities in many cases. For example, there is a role for institutions to both develop new products and invest in structures and mechanisms that enable a managed withdrawal from reliance on coal-powered electricity within developing economies. In response to this, we have developed several responsible investment products that channel our customers\u2019 savings towards ESG-themed investments, such as the Asia Sustainable Bond Fund recently launched by Eastspring. More information on our ESG-related investment activity is available in the Responsible Investment section.\n\nA review is underway to assess suitable targets in respect of the carbon emissions from our investment portfolio. We are also exploring further environmental/climate risk opportunities, such as the development of investment, insurance, and digital products to support climate risk management."

        "answer": "Processes used to determine material risks and opportunities: Our company has developed capabilities to execute climate stress testing and scenario analysis to improve our understanding of risk exposures for risk management and business decision making. Due to challenges in data sourcing and processes, there have been impacts on certain climate disclosures.\n\nClimate scenario analysis is used as a risk assessment tool to provide insights on the long-term effects of transition and physical risks across our corporate and retail banking portfolios, as well as our own operations. Our sustainable finance ambition enables sustainable infrastructure and energy systems, promotes decarbonisation efforts across the real economy, and enhances investor capital through sustainable investment.\n\nWe aim to achieve net zero in our financed emissions by 2050 and in our own operations and supply chain by 2030. We aim to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn of sustainable finance and investment for our customers in their transition to net zero and a sustainable future.\n\nOur assessment of climate risks covers three distinct time periods: short term (up to 2025), medium term (2026 to 2035), and long term (2036 to 2050). Transition or physical climate-related issues identified are assessed using enhanced questionnaires and scoring tools.\n\nWe support our customers in their transition through our sustainable finance and investment ambition. Our sustainable finance data dictionary includes a detailed definition of contributing activities.\n\nCertain perils, such as coastal, river, and surface water flooding, drive potential credit losses in our retail portfolio. Around 20% of our financed properties are in London, and most are protected by the Thames Barrier.\n\nWe identified six key sectors with the highest exposure to climate transition risk: automotive, chemicals, construction and building materials, metals and mining, oil and gas, and power and utilities. We continued to improve our identification and assessment of climate risk within our retail mortgage portfolio, with increased investments in physical risk data and enhancements to our internal risk assessment capabilities and models.\n\nOpportunities include sustainable finance, sustainable investment, and sustainable infrastructure. For a detailed breakdown of our sustainable finance progress by geography, see the ESG Data Pack.\n\nWe report our exposure to high transition risk sectors in our wholesale portfolio. Since 2020, we have rolled out the questionnaire to include our largest customers in the next highest climate transition risk sectors: agriculture, industrials, real estate, and transportation.\n\nAs a result of climate scenario analysis, our largest and most impacted sectors \u2013 power and utilities, construction and building materials, and chemicals \u2013 are subject to increased levels of transition risks. Our asset management division is increasingly considering both physical and transition risks and integrating ESG and climate analysis into the investment decision-making process.\n\nTransition to net zero represents one of our strategic pillars. We aim to be net zero in our operations and supply chain by 2030 and in our financed emissions by 2050. Scenario analysis supports our strategy by assessing our position under a range of climate scenarios and helping us plan for the future and meet growing regulatory requirements.\n\nWe continue to develop our climate scenario analysis exercises to have a more comprehensive understanding of climate headwinds, risks, and opportunities that will support our strategic planning and actions. We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of climate-related issues on financial planning, particularly the impact on financial performance and financial position. We expect to further enhance our disclosure and processes in relation to acquisitions/divestments in the medium term.\n\nClimate change poses a physical risk to the buildings we occupy as an organization, including offices, retail branches, and data centers. We use stress testing to evaluate the potential impact to our owned or leased premises. Our scenario stress test, conducted in 2022, analyzed how seven different climate change-related hazards could impact 500 of our critical and important buildings.\n\nOur Climate Solutions Partnership is a philanthropic initiative that aims to identify and remove barriers to scale for climate change solutions. We support start-up companies developing carbon-cutting technologies, nature-based solutions, renewable energy initiatives in Asia, and the WWF-led Asia Sustainable Palm Oil Links programme.\n\nDuring Board meetings, we balance discussions on the company's performance, emerging risks, and duties to shareholders while remaining conscious of responsibilities to support communities and help customers. In 2022, the Board approved an update to the thermal coal phase-out policy and the publication of an updated energy policy. We have committed to publishing our own climate transition plan in 2023."

It helps to build our awareness of climate change, plan for the future and meet our growing regulatory requirements. \u2013 In 2022, we conducted our first internal climate scenario analysis exercise where we used four scenarios to represent the range of potential outcomes for global climate change. The analysis considered the key regions where we operate and assessed the impact on our balance sheet between the 2022 and 2050 time period. Key drivers of performance and how they were taken into account \u2013 Climate scenario analysis enables us to model how different potential climate pathways may impact our customers and portfolios, particularly in terms of credit losses. Under the Current Commitments scenario, we anticipate moderate levels of losses related to transition risks. However, the rise in global warming will lead to increasing levels of physical risk losses in later years.\n\nScenarios used and how they factored in government policies \u2013 The scenario assumptions for our climate stress testing exercise include varying levels of governmental climate policy changes, macroeconomic factors, and technological developments. However, these scenarios depend on the development of technologies that are still uncertain, such as global hydrogen production to decarbonize aviation and shipping. For details of the assumptions, see the ESG Data Pack.\n\nHow our strategies may change and adapt \u2013 The nature of the scenarios, our evolving capabilities, and the limitations of the analysis result in indicative outcomes of climate change headwinds, although they are not a direct forecast. \u2013 Developments in climate science, data, methodology, and scenario analysis techniques will help us refine our approach further. We therefore expect this view of risk to evolve over time. \u2013 We intend to continue to strengthen our capabilities for climate scenario analysis and use the results for decision making, particularly in respect of strategy, by utilizing the range of scenario analysis outcomes to shape our strategy across business and regions. \u2013 We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of transition and physical risk quantitatively, due to transitional challenges including data limitations and evolving science and methodologies."

Process - We have integrated climate risk into our existing risk framework, and incorporated it into the policies and controls for the relevant risks where appropriate. We recognize the need for enhanced capabilities and new sources of data.\n\nWe consider greenwashing to be an emerging risk that is likely to increase over time, as we develop capabilities and offerings to help our clients transition to a low-carbon economy. We also acknowledge that green finance taxonomies are not consistent globally, and evolving taxonomies and practices could result in revisions in our sustainable finance reporting going forward.\n\nWe use stress testing and scenario analysis to assess how these climate risks will impact our customers, business, and infrastructure. Integration into policies and procedures - In 2022, we incorporated climate considerations into our mortgage origination process for our retail mortgage business and new money request process for our key wholesale businesses. We also continued to enhance our climate risk scoring tool, which will enable us to assess our customers\u2019 exposures to climate risk.

        "answer": "Scenario analysis - Under the definition from the TCFD Recommendations, our credit exposure (EXP) in carbon-related sectors amounts to 7.3% of our total credit exposure. Our company's transition risk assessment focuses on the sectors of electric utilities and oil, gas & coal in Japan. The analysis period extends until 2050, although the International Energy Agency (IEA) scenario only goes up to 2040. The approximate increase in costs under dynamic and static scenarios are \u00a5120 billion and \u00a5310 billion, respectively. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios considered are 8.5 (4\u00b0C) and 2.6 (2\u00b0C).\n\nIn our analysis of potential impacts on our clients' businesses, we utilized two scenarios: a static scenario, which assumes no transformation of the existing business structure, and a dynamic scenario, under which the business structure undergoes transformation. The details of our analysis focused on credit costs through 2050.\n\nWe employed a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the rates at which typhoons and other storms cause wind and water-related building loss or damage. We then analyzed the potential direct (collateral value) and indirect (business stagnation) impacts on our company's credit costs from the loss or damage of mortgaged real estate (buildings) in Japan. This analysis targeted middle-market firms and SMEs in Japan. The impact on mortgage lending value was limited, while the impact of business stagnation was \u00a552 billion at most under both 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C scenarios."

        "answer": "Our company conducts financial impact analysis on the top three physical risks, transition risks, and climate opportunities to formulate strategies in line with TCFD recommendations. Financial impact analysis of climaterelated risks primarily focuses on marketand technology-related costs to reduce carbon emissions, aligning with our Net Zero Emissions by 2050 goal. This includes expenses on energy conservation or carbon reduction facilities, more expensive renewable energy or RECs, carbon credits, and additional costs due to uncertainties in the development of new energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies.\n\nPhysical risks mainly focus on growing electricity costs due to chronic climate changes, such as rising temperatures. Costs related to combating drought include expenses for building water reclamation systems, using reclaimed water, and purchasing backup water sources. For acute climate change disasters like floods and strong winds, we have already designed prevention systems into our facilities and will not be calculating their financial impact.\n\nOur company has also estimated the cost of reputation damage from failing to meet net zero emission targets, though there is no globally recognized approach to estimate such financial impact. The financial impact of a 1% revenue reduction was a consensus reached by experts after discussions and assessments. The estimated financial impact from climate opportunities includes reduced costs from increased energy and water use efficiency and diverse water sources, as well as additional income from providing low-carbon products and services such as 7nm or more advanced processes, Power Management ICs (PMICs), and ultralow power (ULP) ICs.\n\nAnalysis results indicate that developing low-carbon products and services presents the greatest opportunity for positive financial impacts, as demands for low-carbon products of advanced manufacturing processes continue to grow."

        "answer": "In compliance with TCFD recommendations, our company has evaluated the impact of various greenhouse gas (GHG) emission controls on our operations and the supply chain for certain transition and physical risks. We have considered the outcomes when determining the resiliency of strategies and have also referred to the latest physical science basis, published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to develop our own climate scenarios. In addition, we have also included potential growth in carbon emissions from expanding our operations and new facilities as well as existing carbon reduction actions into general evaluations to analyze the potential financial impacts of climate risks. In the past, we evaluated climate risks solely using the worst-case scenario, but the future of climate change is highly unpredictable. As such, we have opted to evaluate climate risks across several scenarios this year to help map out and communicate operations strategies internally and give comprehensive insights into climate trends over the mid-to-long term.\n\nClimate Scenario Selection\n\nIn terms of transition risks, there is now a global consensus that carbon pricing schemes are a necessary policy to achieve net zero emissions. We referenced the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO), an IEA report commonly used by companies around the world, and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to conduct climate scenario analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing then serves as the basis for us to evaluate the impacts of carbon pricing schemes on our locations in different countries.\n\nIn terms of physical risks, we referenced the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) published by IPCC in 2021 and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes in the future. We also adopted the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) to derive GHG emissions under different social and economic landscapes. Our impact analysis on physical risks covers climate change evaluations across every region of the globe and provides detailed impact analysis to our locations and suppliers around the world through downscaling analysis."

We aim to achieve this starting in 2030, with more stringent targets for thermal coal emissions set for 2024. Our progress can be found in the Financed emission section.\n\u2022 Regarding climate-related opportunities, we have established a $1 billion Sustainable Finance income target and a $300 billion mobilization of Sustainable Finance targets, with deadlines extending to 2025 and 2030, respectively.\n\u2022 During the year, we revised the measurement of our Oil and gas sector emissions from income-based carbon intensity to absolute financed emissions. This change was made to provide a more accurate representation of the sector's emission profile and establish a carbon budget intended to decrease over time.\n\u2022 In 2022, we broadened the scope of our financed emissions calculations and, in this report, we announce three new sectoral targets covering transportation. By 2030, we aim to reduce emissions in the transportation sector:\n  \u2013 34% reduction in aviation (production intensity)\n  \u2013 Reduce our alignment delta in shipping from +2.6% to 0%\n  \u2013 49% reduction in automotive manufacturers (production intensity)\n\nDescription of methodologies used to calculate targets and measures:\n\u2022 The methodologies used to calculate baseline emissions are detailed in the Our Clients \u2013 reducing our financed emissions section.\n\nOther key performance indicators used:\n\u2022 In 2021, we established Sustainability Aspirations, which include an interim target to aim for net zero in our operations by 2030 and in our financed emissions by 2050. In 2022, we advanced our target for reaching net zero in our operations by 2030 to 2025."
