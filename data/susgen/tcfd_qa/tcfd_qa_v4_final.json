Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being part of this process.\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks for our organization. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is interviewed to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, our reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

        "output": "Our company's Approach to Enterprise Risk Management:\nRisk management is a crucial process in our organization, encompassing all functions. We identify and assess risks related to financial and market performance, operational efficiency, emergency preparedness and response, environmental compliance, and health and safety, among other areas. We prioritize risks based on their potential impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers, as well as regulatory requirements. Our Enterprise Risk Management program includes managing key enterprise risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments evaluate business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are assessed as part of our financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have reviewed potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. We have considered raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management discusses which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success. We also consult external stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. ISO 14001 defines an environmental aspect as an element of an organization's activities, products, or services that has or may have an impact on the environment. Our significant environmental impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system. Each environmental aspect, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, is ranked from 0 through 4 based on criteria like severity, magnitude, probability, frequency, controllability, duration, employee concerns, community concerns, boundaries, business impact, and regulatory. The highest scores identify our significant impacts, which we focus on in more detail in our environmental management systems.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our suppliers of raw materials. As a global organization, we rely on various suppliers for raw materials, some of which may be subject to supply constraints due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact.

Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner.

        "output": "Our company does not perceive any significant risk from climate change that would materially affect us. Instead, we view the shift towards a low carbon economy as an opportunity. In our fiscal year 2019, we managed to reduce 637 (million metric ton) CO2 at customer sites through our environmental initiatives. Based on a favorable business case, we aimed to decrease the carbon footprint of our own operations by half by 2020 compared to 2014 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. We integrate climate change risks into our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process, addressing areas such as legal, market, regulatory, and physical risks. We classify these risks into one of the four dimensions \u2013 Strategic, Operations, Financial, and Compliance. An illustrative risk within the Compliance dimension is the F-gas regulation (EU) 517 / 2014, which encompasses the reduction of SF6. Our company is subject to this regulation, with 24 sites currently employing SF6. The reduction of SF6 is one facet of our efforts to become carbon neutral by 2030. We accomplished a reduction of nearly 6% compared to the preceding year and 54% since 2014."

        "output": "Our company does not see any significant transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our Business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in a water-stressed country has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the rainy season, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

        "output": "Our company has established and overseen a collection of risk management and control systems to identify and respond to potential threats to our business continuity. Central components of these systems consist of enterprise-wide procedures for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning enables us to recognize potential risks prior to significant business decisions, while management reporting facilitates closer monitoring of risks as our business advances. Our internal auditors regularly evaluate the sufficiency and efficiency of our risk management, and any shortcomings can be remedied through suitable measures.\n\nOur risk management strategy is all-encompassing, dynamic, and management-focused, and is embedded within our organization. It addresses both risks and opportunities. Our strategy is grounded in globally recognized frameworks, such as the COSO Framework and ISO 31000, and is customized to our company's specifications. The frameworks link our risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system.\n\nOur risk management process targets early recognition and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially impact our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is usually three years, and we employ a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities that remain after the implementation of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a systematic manner, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting typically follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues promptly.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on impact and probability, taking into account various viewpoints, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is complemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down approach ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at various management levels and are incorporated into the subsequent reporting process, if deemed relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are categorized within and for each of the departments mentioned. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity.

        "output": "Our company has established and coordinated a set of risk management and control systems to identify and address developments that may threaten our business continuity. These systems consist of enterprise-wide processes for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning enables us to assess potential risks prior to major business decisions, while management reporting allows us to closely monitor these risks as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management, and any deficiencies are addressed through appropriate measures. This coordination of processes and procedures aims to keep the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board informed about significant risks in a timely manner.\n\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-focused, integrated into the organization, and covers both risks and opportunities. It is based on globally recognized standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO Standard 31000, and is customized to our specific needs. The frameworks connect the risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system. They consider our strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of our business operations, the reliability of our financial reporting, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important.\n\nOur risk management process aims for early identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially impact the achievement of our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities that remain after the implementation of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a structured manner, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues in a timely manner.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on their impact and likelihood, considering different impact perspectives, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if deemed relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each organizational unit. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. The first step in assuming responsibility for a risk or opportunity involves choosing one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies for risks include avoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance. Our general response strategy for opportunities is to \"seize\" the opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures must be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe have developed a range of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates through hedging activities. Regarding our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and clearly defined approval processes, helps us identify and respond to project risks at an early stage, even before the bidding phase. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure to such risks and to avoid or minimize potential losses.\n\nWe address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries and adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary.\n\nThere are global risks from the transmission of infectious agents from animals to humans, from humans to humans, and in other ways. Epidemics, pandemics, or other spread patterns, such as bioterrorism, threaten to cause high disease rates in different countries, regions, or continents. We continuously monitor information from the World Health Organization (WHO), the American and European Centers for Disease Control, the German Robert Koch Institute, and other institutions to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible."

Introduction\n\nAs a TCFD specialist, I'd like to emphasize the importance of the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) framework in today's business environment. The TCFD framework is an essential tool for organizations to effectively understand, assess, and manage climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nII. The Role of TCFD\n\nThe TCFD was established by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in 2015 to address the financial risks posed by climate change. The framework provides a set of recommendations for companies to disclose climate-related information in a consistent, transparent, and comparable manner.\n\nIII. Benefits of TCFD\n\nAdopting the TCFD recommendations can bring numerous benefits to organizations. These include:\n\n1. Enhanced risk management: By identifying and assessing climate-related risks and opportunities, organizations can better manage their exposure to climate-related financial risks.\n2. Improved investor relations: TCFD-aligned disclosures can help companies engage more effectively with investors, as they provide clear and consistent information on climate-related risks and opportunities.\n3. Regulatory compliance: Many jurisdictions are implementing regulations requiring climate-related disclosures, and TCFD-aligned disclosures can help organizations meet these requirements.\n4. Reputational benefits: Companies that demonstrate a commitment to transparency and disclosure around climate-related risks and opportunities can enhance their reputation and build trust with stakeholders.\n\nIV. Implementing TCFD\n\nImplementing the TCFD recommendations involves several steps:\n\n1. Governance: Establishing a governance structure to oversee climate-related risks and opportunities, and ensuring that the board and senior management are engaged and informed.\n2. Scoping: Identifying the material climate-related risks and opportunities that are relevant to the organization.\n3. Metrics and Targets: Developing metrics and targets to measure and report on climate-related performance.\n4. Reporting: Providing clear and transparent disclosures on climate-related risks and opportunities in the organization's annual report or other public filings.\n\nV. Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, as a TCFD specialist, I strongly believe that the TCFD framework is a crucial tool for organizations to effectively manage climate-related risks and opportunities. By adopting the TCFD recommendations, organizations can enhance their risk management, improve investor relations, ensure regulatory compliance, and build trust with stakeholders.",

These risks are evaluated as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts.

As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our policies and procedures, including our Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy, help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner.

These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. Additionally, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have reviewed potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. We have considered raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management discusses which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success. We also consult external stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. ISO 14001 defines an environmental aspect as an element of an organization's activities, products, or services that has or may have an impact on the environment. Our significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system. Each environmental aspect, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, is ranked from 0 through 4 based on criteria like severity, magnitude, probability, frequency, controllability, duration, employee concerns, community concerns, boundaries, business impact, and regulatory. The highest scores identify our significant impacts, which we focus on in more detail in our environmental management systems.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with global efforts to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our suppliers of raw materials. As a global organization, we rely on various suppliers for raw materials, some of which may be subject to supply constraints due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the production of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nWe assess upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nWe assess downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward certain business areas due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

We prioritize risks based on their impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being part of this process.\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is consulted to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with global climate targets to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In situations where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the production of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our policies, supplier codes of conduct, purchase order terms and conditions, and responsible sourcing policies help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, our reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward certain business areas due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a benchmark year. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new project that drives the selection process for new sites and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in a certain country has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the rainy season, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

We are dedicated to offering innovative technologies to facilitate the transformation of the energy value chain over the next few decades. To accomplish this, we have created comprehensive multi-modal simulation tools and compared the results with external research studies, such as IRENA, Fraunhofer, IHS, Agora Energiewende, and IEA.\n\nRegarding our internal operations, we have conducted scenario analysis as a stress test on our carbon neutral program to ensure its resilience to higher energy or CO2-prices. Our experts applied high-price scenarios using IHS Autonomy, IEA Sustainable Development Scenario, and the Greenpeace Energy Revolution scenario to identify potential risks to our CO2-reduction plan. By utilizing predictions on energy prices from these scenarios and a forecast for CO2 prices from the High-Level Commission on Carbon-Pricing, we were able to evaluate necessary adjustments and confirm the program's resilience.\n\nFor our business, climate-related scenario analysis enables us to anticipate potential consequences from regulatory changes, R&D, and customer trends and requirements. In fiscal 2020, we performed forward-looking scenario analysis in accordance with the TCFD recommendation. Besides IHS scenarios, we applied the IEA SDS scenarios, focusing on indicators such as renewable uptake, decentralization, energy efficiency demand, and CO2 prices for 2020-2040. The analysis did not influence our strategy but strongly confirmed it. The results showed that our portfolio is resilient to climate change, and the majority of our portfolio benefits from energy transformation, including Virtual Power Plants (VPP), Decentralized Energy Systems (DES), future grids, Digital Grids (DG), and storage."

Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the hierarchical level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. In a first step, assuming responsibility for a specific risk or opportunity involves choosing one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies with respect to risks are avoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance of the relevant risk. Our general response strategy with respect to opportunities is to \"seize\" the relevant opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures have to be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates by engaging in hedging activities. Regarding our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and complemented by clearly defined approval processes, assists us in identifying and responding to project risks at an early stage, even before the bidding phase. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential cases of damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure to such risks and to avoid or minimize potential losses.\n\nWe address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries and adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary.\n\nOur company constantly checks information from reliable sources to identify and respond to potential risks related to the transmission of infectious agents from animals to humans, from humans to humans, and in other ways. Epidemic, pandemic, or other spread patterns such as bioterrorism threaten to cause high disease rates in different countries, regions, or continents. We are committed to ensuring the health and safety of our employees, customers, and stakeholders, and we take all necessary measures to mitigate the risks associated with infectious diseases and bioterrorism."

This is illustrated in a table at the end of this section of the report. Initially categorized as emerging risks, the ESG risks related to our business, which include climate risk, have recently been upgraded to Principal Risk status. Recently, we have engaged a dedicated climate risk consultancy to further refine our understanding of the nature and materiality of the risks posed by climate change to our business.\n\nWe recognize that the implementation of our strategic ESG framework can generate opportunities for our company. Some of these opportunities will come through our efforts to take early mitigating action against the climate risks we identify, including incorporating transition risk into investment decisions to reduce the risk of being exposed to stranded assets.

        "output": "After conducting a thorough ESG review, our company has established a new Strategic Framework (the 'framework') for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) matters. This framework aligns with our business strategy and our mission to help individuals maximize their potential, build wealth, and achieve their savings goals. The framework consists of three strategic pillars, each with a clear connection to our business strategy. In each pillar, we have identified specific focus areas where our company can make a significant impact.\n\nWe are convinced that our new ESG framework and our long-term goals to decrease carbon emissions and promote an inclusive transition are essential for meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary duties. This approach will enable us to manage risk over the long term while contributing to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Given that transition risk represents the most immediate and impactful financial risk, we have initiated an analysis of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio. This assessment focused on investments where our company holds significant influence and control over the investment process. Preliminary reports were generated using climate-related data and metrics provided by a proprietary vendor tool. This analysis allows us to categorize the contributions of various sectors to the overall carbon footprint metrics of the asset book and pinpoint the most carbon-intensive sectors. It also enables us to identify and monitor the most carbon-heavy companies in our investment portfolio. We have also calculated the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) for the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes in our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in markets with varying degrees of development. Some markets boast diversified, service-led economies and mature financial markets, while others rely more on primary and energy-intensive industries. In emerging markets, the energy transition is likely to progress more slowly than in advanced economies. This was emphasized by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), during a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. Mr. Menon stated that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily reliant on fossil fuels for their energy needs, and it is unrealistic to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy overnight.'\n\nFor our company, this implies that while we are committed to reducing carbon emissions in our investment portfolio, we recognize the need to implement this strategy in a manner that acknowledges the unique characteristics of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition equitably. Our commitment to an inclusive transition aims to strike a balance between our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We understand the importance of coalition building in driving an inclusive transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we collaborate with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale up domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group our company has co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to generate new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."

Due to challenges in data sourcing and processes, there have been impacts on certain climate disclosures.\n\nClimate scenario analysis is used as a risk assessment tool to provide insights on the long-term effects of transition and physical risks across our corporate and retail banking portfolios, as well as our own operations. Our sustainable finance initiative enables sustainable infrastructure and energy systems, promotes decarbonisation efforts across the real economy, and enhances investor capital through sustainable investment.\n\nWe aim to achieve net zero in our financed emissions by 2050 and in our own operations and supply chain by 2030. We aim to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn of sustainable finance and investment for our customers in their transition to net zero and a sustainable future.\n\nOur assessment of climate risks covers three distinct time periods: short term (up to 2025), medium term (2026 to 2035), and long term (2036 to 2050). Transition or physical climate-related issues identified are assessed using enhanced questionnaires and scoring tools.\n\nWe support our customers in their transition through our sustainable finance and investment initiative. Our sustainable finance data dictionary includes a detailed definition of contributing activities.\n\nCertain perils, such as coastal, river, and surface water flooding, drive potential credit losses in our retail portfolio. Around 20% of our financed properties are in a major city, and most are protected by a flood barrier.\n\nWe identified six key sectors with the highest exposure to climate transition risk: automotive, chemicals, construction and building materials, metals and mining, oil and gas, and power and utilities. We continued to improve our identification and assessment of climate risk within our retail mortgage portfolio, with increased investments in physical risk data and enhancements to our internal risk assessment capabilities and models.\n\nOpportunities include sustainable finance, sustainable investment, and sustainable infrastructure. For a detailed breakdown of our sustainable finance progress by region, see the ESG Data Pack.\n\nWe report our exposure to high transition risk sectors in our wholesale portfolio. Since 2020, we have rolled out the questionnaire to include our largest customers in the next highest climate transition risk sectors: agriculture, industrials, real estate, and transportation.\n\nAs a result of climate scenario analysis, our largest and most impacted sectors \u2013 power and utilities, construction and building materials, and chemicals \u2013 are subject to increased levels of transition risks. Our asset management division is increasingly considering both physical and transition risks and integrating ESG and climate analysis into the investment decision-making process.\n\nTransition to net zero represents one of our strategic priorities. We aim to be net zero in our operations and supply chain by 2030 and in our financed emissions by 2050. Scenario analysis supports our strategy by assessing our position under a range of climate scenarios and helping us plan for the future and meet growing regulatory requirements.\n\nWe continue to develop our climate scenario analysis exercises to have a more comprehensive understanding of climate headwinds, risks, and opportunities that will support our strategic planning and actions. We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of climate-related issues on financial planning, particularly the impact on financial performance and financial position. We expect to further enhance our disclosure and processes in relation to acquisitions/divestments in the medium term.\n\nClimate change poses a physical risk to the buildings we occupy as an organization, including offices, retail branches, and data centers. We use stress testing to evaluate the potential impact to our owned or leased premises. Our scenario stress test, conducted in 2022, analyzed how seven different climate change-related hazards could impact 500 of our critical and important buildings.\n\nOur Climate Solutions Partnership is a philanthropic initiative that aims to identify and remove barriers to scale for climate change solutions. We support start-up companies developing carbon-cutting technologies, nature-based solutions, renewable energy initiatives, and the WWF-led Asia Sustainable Palm Oil Links programme.\n\nDuring Board meetings, we balance discussions on the company's performance, emerging risks, and duties to shareholders while remaining conscious of responsibilities to support communities and help customers. In 2022, the Board approved an update to the thermal coal phase-out policy and the publication of an updated energy policy. We have committed to publishing our own climate transition plan in 2023."

It enhances our understanding of climate change, enables us to plan for the future, and assists us in meeting growing regulatory requirements.\n\nIn 2022, our company conducted its initial internal climate scenario analysis exercise, employing four scenarios to represent the spectrum of potential climate change outcomes. The analysis focused on the primary regions where we operate and evaluated the impact on our balance sheet between the 2022 and 2050 timeframe. Key performance drivers and their consideration:\n\nClimate scenario analysis allows our company to model how different climate pathways might influence our customers and portfolios, particularly concerning credit losses. Under the Current Commitments scenario, we anticipate moderate credit losses due to transition risks. However, the escalating global warming will result in increasing physical risk losses in later years.\n\nAssumptions of scenarios and their relation to government policies: The assumptions for our climate stress testing exercise encompass varying levels of governmental climate policy changes, macroeconomic factors, and technological developments. However, these scenarios hinge on the development of technologies that are still uncertain, such as global hydrogen production to decarbonize aviation and shipping. For more information on the assumptions, please refer to the ESG Data Pack.\n\nPossible adjustments and adaptations of our strategies: The nature of the scenarios, our evolving capabilities, and the limitations of the analysis result in indicative outcomes of climate change headwinds, although they do not represent a direct forecast.\n\nAdvancements in climate science, data, methodology, and scenario analysis techniques will enable our company to refine its approach further. Consequently, our perspective on risk is expected to evolve over time.\n\nOur company intends to continue enhancing its capabilities for climate scenario analysis and employ the results for decision-making, primarily in relation to strategy, by utilizing the range of scenario analysis outcomes to shape our strategy across business units and regions.\n\nAt present, our company does not fully disclose the quantitative impacts of transition and physical risks, due to challenges including data limitations and evolving science and methodologies."

Process - We have integrated climate risk into our existing risk framework, and incorporated it into the policies and controls for the relevant risks where appropriate. We recognize the need for enhanced capabilities and new sources of data.\n\nWe consider greenwashing to be an emerging risk that is likely to increase over time, as we develop capabilities and offerings to help our clients transition to a low-carbon economy. We also acknowledge that green finance taxonomies are not consistent globally, and evolving taxonomies and practices could result in revisions in our sustainable finance reporting going forward.\n\nWe use stress testing and scenario analysis to assess how these climate risks will impact our customers, business, and infrastructure. Integration into policies and procedures - In 2022, we incorporated climate considerations into our mortgage origination process for our retail mortgage business and new money request process for our key wholesale businesses. We also continued to enhance our climate risk scoring tool, which will enable us to assess our customers\u2019 exposures to climate risk. We published our updated energy policy, covering various sectors, and updated our thermal coal phase-out policy.\n\nWe are integrating climate risk into the policies, processes, and controls across many areas of our organization, and we will continue to update these as our climate risk management capabilities mature over time. Consider climate-related risks in traditional banking industry risk categories (supplementary guidance for banks) - In 2022, we expanded our scope to consider climate risk impacts on our other risk areas (including treasury risk and traded risk) in our risk framework. We also analyzed in our internal scenario analysis exercise how climate risks impact how we manage other risks within our organization, including credit risk, and on an exploratory basis: market, operational, liquidity, insurance, and pension risks.\n\nAt our company, we are committed to managing climate risk in a comprehensive and proactive manner. We recognize the importance of addressing the physical and transition risks associated with climate change, and we are continually enhancing our capabilities to assess and manage these risks. We also understand the need for transparency and consistency in our reporting and disclosures related to climate risk, and we will continue to engage with stakeholders to build trust and confidence in our approach.\n\nGreenwashing is an emerging risk that we take seriously, and we are committed to ensuring that our offerings and communications are transparent and accurate. We acknowledge that the taxonomies and practices related to sustainable finance are evolving, and we will continue to adapt our reporting and disclosures to reflect these changes.\n\nThrough the use of stress testing and scenario analysis, we are able to assess the potential impact of climate risks on our customers, business, and infrastructure. We are also integrating climate risk into our policies, processes, and controls across many areas of our organization, and we will continue to update these as our capabilities and understanding of climate risk evolve.\n\nIn addition to the five priority risk areas mentioned earlier, we are also considering the impact of climate risk on other traditional banking industry risk categories, including treasury risk, traded risk, credit risk, market risk, operational risk, liquidity risk, insurance risk, and pension risk.

This includes expenses on energy conservation or carbon reduction facilities, more expensive renewable energy or RECs, carbon credits, and additional costs due to uncertainties in the development of new energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies.\n\nPhysical risks mainly focus on growing electricity costs due to chronic climate changes, such as rising temperatures. Costs related to combating drought include expenses for building water reclamation systems, using reclaimed water, and purchasing backup water sources. For acute climate change disasters like floods and strong winds, we have already designed prevention systems into our facilities and will not be calculating their financial impact.\n\nOur company has also estimated the cost of reputation damage from failing to meet net zero emission targets. However, there is no globally recognized approach to estimate such financial impact, and these calculations are subject to uncertainty. The financial impact of a 1% revenue reduction was a consensus reached by experts after discussions and assessments.\n\nThe financial impact of climate opportunities includes reduced costs from increased energy and water use efficiency and diverse water sources, as well as additional income from providing low-carbon products and services. These may include advanced manufacturing processes, Power Management ICs (PMICs), and ultralow power (ULP) ICs.\n\nAnalysis results indicate that developing low-carbon products and services presents the greatest opportunity for positive financial impacts, as demands for such products continue to grow."

We have examined the consequences of these risks when formulating our strategies and have also referred to the most recent physical science findings, published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to establish our own climate scenarios. Furthermore, we have incorporated potential increases in carbon emissions from expanding our operations and new facilities, as well as existing carbon reduction measures, into our evaluations to assess the potential financial implications of climate risks. Previously, we assessed climate risks based on the worst-case scenario alone. However, given the uncertainty surrounding future climate change, we have chosen to evaluate climate risks across multiple scenarios this year to help inform our internal decision-making and provide a comprehensive understanding of climate trends over the mid-to-long term.\n\nClimate Scenario Selection\nRegarding transition risks, there is a growing consensus that carbon pricing schemes will be essential for achieving net zero emissions. We have consulted the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO), a widely used IEA report, and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to conduct our climate scenario analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing serves as the foundation for us to assess the impacts of carbon pricing schemes on our operations in various countries.\n\nIn terms of physical risks, we have relied on the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) published by the IPCC in 2021 and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes. We have also adopted the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) to determine GHG emissions under various social and economic conditions.

        "output": "Our company's Approach to Managing Risks:\nRisk management in our organization encompasses all functions, including identifying risks related to financial and market performance, operational efficiency, emergency preparedness and response, environmental compliance, and regulatory impacts. We prioritize risks based on their potential impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being an integral part of this process.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments evaluate business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks for our organization. These risks are evaluated as part of our financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for substantial financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is consulted to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where our organization depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for substantial financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for substantial financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, our reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

Introduction\n\nAs a TCFD specialist, I cannot stress enough the importance of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework in today's business landscape. This framework, developed by the Financial Stability Board, is a voluntary and consistent reporting standard designed to help organizations understand, assess, and disclose climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nII. Climate-related Risks and Opportunities\n\nThe TCFD framework is essential for understanding and addressing climate-related risks and opportunities. Climate risks can materialize in various forms, such as physical risks (e.g., extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and natural disasters) and transition risks (e.g., regulatory changes, technological advancements, and shifts in market preferences).\n\nIII. TCFD Recommendations\n\nThe TCFD recommendations cover four key areas: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. By implementing these recommendations, organizations can improve their understanding of climate-related risks and opportunities and enhance their ability to manage these factors effectively.\n\nIV. Benefits of TCFD Compliance\n\nCompliance with the TCFD framework offers numerous benefits, including improved risk management, enhanced investor confidence, and increased transparency. Furthermore, many investors and regulators are increasingly demanding TCFD-compliant disclosures, making it a crucial aspect of corporate sustainability and long-term success.\n\nV. Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, as a TCFD specialist, I strongly advocate for the adoption and implementation of the TCFD framework by organizations. By addressing climate-related risks and opportunities, organizations can not only mitigate potential financial losses but also seize new opportunities and contribute to a more sustainable future.",

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our Business Services (SI) division, for instance, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For example, we have been providing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to reduce our emissions by half compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the US, Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the US, Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our water strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal water tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low, due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For example, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure.

This framework aligns with our business strategy and our mission to help individuals maximize their potential, build wealth, and achieve their financial goals. The framework consists of three strategic pillars, each with a clear connection to our business strategy. In each pillar, we have identified focus areas where our company can make a significant impact.\n\nWe are confident that our new ESG framework and our commitment to reducing carbon emissions and supporting a fair transition are essential steps for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and discharge our fiduciary duties. This approach will enable us to manage risk over the long term while contributing to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. We have initiated an analysis of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio, focusing on investments where we have control and influence over the investment process. Preliminary reports have been generated using climate-related data and metrics provided by a vendor tool. This analysis allows us to identify the sectors contributing to the carbon footprint of our asset book and pinpoint the most carbon-intensive companies. We have also calculated the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) for the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes of our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in markets with varying levels of development. Some markets have advanced, service-oriented economies and well-established financial markets, while others rely more on primary industries and energy-intensive sectors. In emerging markets, the energy transition is likely to progress more slowly than in advanced economies. This was emphasized by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of a Southeast Asian country (MAS), during a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. Mr. Menon stated that 'Emerging economies are at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to basic necessities like electricity, modern sanitation, and clean water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most emerging economies are still heavily reliant on fossil fuels for their energy needs, and it is unrealistic to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy overnight.'\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are dedicated to reducing carbon emissions in our investment portfolio, we recognize the need to implement this strategy in a manner that acknowledges the unique challenges of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition equitably. Our commitment to an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities to all our stakeholders. We understand the importance of collaboration in driving an inclusive transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we collaborate with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in Southeast Asia, to scale up domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group our company has co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to generate new ideas for scaling up investments to further the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."

This framework is fully aligned to our business strategy and our purpose of helping people get the most out of life by making healthcare accessible and affordable, helping them accumulate wealth through growing their assets, and empowering our customers to save for their goals.\n\nWe have identified three strategic pillars within our ESG framework, which have clear alignment with our business strategy. Within each of these, specific differentiating focus areas have been identified where we believe our company can make a meaningful impact. We will place greater focus on these differentiators.\n\nOur new strategic ESG framework and the long-term goals to decarbonise our investment portfolio and support an inclusive transition are an important way for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and fulfill our fiduciary obligations.

We acknowledge that implementing our strategic ESG framework can generate opportunities for our organization. Some of these opportunities will arise from our efforts to take early mitigating action against the climate risks we identify, including incorporating transition risk into investment decisions to minimize the risk of holding stranded assets. Others will come through supporting an inclusive transition. The infrastructure and capital expenditure required to facilitate the transition presents attractive investment opportunities in many cases. For instance, institutions can both develop new products and invest in structures and mechanisms that enable a managed withdrawal from reliance on coal-powered electricity within developing economies. In response to this, our company has developed several responsible investment products that direct our customers' savings towards ESG-themed investments, such as the Asia Sustainable Bond Fund recently launched by Eastspring. More information on our ESG-related investment activity can be found in the Responsible Investment section.\n\nA review is underway to determine suitable targets regarding the carbon emissions from our investment portfolio. We are also exploring additional environmental/climate risk opportunities, such as the development of investment, insurance, and digital products to support climate risk management."

Due to challenges in data sourcing and processes, there have been impacts on certain climate disclosures.\n\nClimate scenario analysis is used as a risk assessment tool to provide insights on the long-term effects of transition and physical risks across our corporate and retail banking portfolios, as well as our own operations. Our sustainable finance ambition enables sustainable infrastructure and energy systems, promotes decarbonisation efforts across the real economy, and enhances investor capital through sustainable investment.\n\nWe aim to achieve net zero in our financed emissions by 2050 and in our own operations and supply chain by 2030. We aim to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn of sustainable finance and investment for our customers in their transition to net zero and a sustainable future.\n\nOur assessment of climate risks covers three distinct time periods: short term (up to 2025), medium term (2026 to 2035), and long term (2036 to 2050). Transition or physical climate-related issues identified are assessed using enhanced questionnaires and scoring tools.\n\nWe support our customers in their transition through our sustainable finance and investment ambition. Our sustainable finance data dictionary includes a detailed definition of contributing activities.\n\nCertain perils, such as coastal, river, and surface water flooding, drive potential credit losses in our retail portfolio. Around 20% of our financed properties are in London, and most are protected by the Thames Barrier.\n\nWe identified six key sectors with the highest exposure to climate transition risk: automotive, chemicals, construction and building materials, metals and mining, oil and gas, and power and utilities. We continue to improve our identification and assessment of climate risk within our retail mortgage portfolio, with increased investments in physical risk data and enhancements to our internal risk assessment capabilities and models.\n\nOpportunities include sustainable finance, sustainable investment, and sustainable infrastructure. For a detailed breakdown of our sustainable finance progress by geography, see the ESG Data Pack.\n\nWe report our exposure to high transition risk sectors in our wholesale portfolio. Since 2020, we have rolled out the questionnaire to include our largest customers in the next highest climate transition risk sectors: agriculture, industrials, real estate, and transportation.\n\nAs a result of climate scenario analysis, our largest and most impacted sectors \u2013 power and utilities, construction and building materials, and chemicals \u2013 are subject to increased levels of transition risks. Our asset management division is increasingly considering both physical and transition risks and integrating ESG and climate analysis into the investment decision-making process.\n\nTransition to net zero represents one of our strategic pillars. We aim to be net zero in our operations and supply chain by 2030 and in our financed emissions by 2050. Scenario analysis supports our strategy by assessing our position under a range of climate scenarios and helping us plan for the future and meet growing regulatory requirements.\n\nWe continue to develop our climate scenario analysis exercises to have a more comprehensive understanding of climate headwinds, risks, and opportunities that will support our strategic planning and actions. We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of climate-related issues on financial planning, particularly the impact on financial performance and financial position. We expect to further enhance our disclosure and processes in relation to acquisitions/divestments in the medium term.\n\nClimate change poses a physical risk to the buildings we occupy as an organization, including offices, retail branches, and data centers. We use stress testing to evaluate the potential impact to our owned or leased premises. Our scenario stress test, conducted in 2022, analyzed how seven different climate change-related hazards could impact 500 of our critical and important buildings.\n\nOur Climate Solutions Partnership is a philanthropic initiative that aims to identify and remove barriers to scale for climate change solutions. We support start-up companies developing carbon-cutting technologies, nature-based solutions, renewable energy initiatives in Asia, and the WWF-led Asia Sustainable Palm Oil Links programme.\n\nDuring Board meetings, we balance discussions on the company's performance, emerging risks, and duties to shareholders while remaining conscious of responsibilities to support communities and help customers.

It enhances our awareness of climate change, enables us to prepare for the future, and assists us in meeting growing regulatory requirements. \u2013 In 2022, we conducted our initial climate scenario analysis exercise, employing four scenarios to represent the spectrum of potential climate change outcomes. The analysis focused on the key regions where our company operates and evaluated the impact on our balance sheet between the 2022 and 2050 timeframe. Key performance drivers and their consideration \u2013 Climate scenario analysis allows our company to model the potential impact of different climate pathways on our customers and investments, with a particular focus on credit losses. Under the Current Commitments scenario, we anticipate moderate levels of losses related to transition risks. However, physical risk losses will increase in later years due to rising global warming.\nAssumptions behind scenarios and government policies \u2013 The assumptions for our climate stress testing exercise include varying levels of governmental climate policy changes, macroeconomic factors, and technological developments.

The financial analysis of climate-related risks primarily concentrates on market and technology-related costs to minimize carbon emissions, in line with our Net Zero Emissions by 2050 goal. This encompasses expenses on energy conservation or carbon reduction facilities, pricier renewable energy or RECs, carbon credits, and additional costs due to uncertainties in the development of new energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies.\n\nPhysical risks primarily focus on escalating electricity costs due to chronic climate changes, such as increasing temperatures. Costs related to combating drought include expenses for constructing water reclamation systems, utilizing reclaimed water, and purchasing backup water sources. For acute climate change disasters like floods and strong winds, we have already integrated prevention systems into our facilities and will not be calculating their financial impact.\n\nOur company has also estimated the cost of reputation damage from failing to meet net zero emission targets. However, there is no globally recognized methodology to quantify such financial impact. The financial impact of a 1% revenue reduction was a consensus reached by experts after discussions and assessments. The financial impact from climate opportunities includes reduced costs from increased energy and water use efficiency and diverse water sources, as well as additional income from providing low-carbon products and services such as 7nm or more advanced processes, Power Management ICs (PMICs), and ultralow power (ULP) ICs.\n\nAnalysis results suggest that developing low-carbon products and services presents the greatest opportunity for positive financial impacts, as demands for low-carbon products and advanced manufacturing processes continue to grow."

We have considered the outcomes when determining the resiliency of strategies and have also referred to the latest physical science basis, published by generic organizations similar to the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to develop our own climate scenarios. In addition, we have also included potential growth in carbon emissions from expanding our operations and new facilities as well as existing carbon reduction actions into general evaluations to analyze the potential financial impacts of climate risks. In the past, we evaluated climate risks solely using the worst-case scenario, but the future of climate change is highly unpredictable. As such, we have opted to evaluate climate risks across several scenarios this year to help map out and communicate operations strategies internally and give comprehensive insights into climate trends over the mid-to-long term.\n\nClimate Scenario Selection\n\nIn terms of transition risks, there is now a global consensus that carbon pricing schemes are a necessary policy to achieve net zero emissions. We referenced a commonly used report by a global energy organization, similar to the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO) published by the IEA, and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to conduct climate scenario analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing then serves as the basis for us to evaluate the impacts of carbon pricing schemes on our locations in different countries.\n\nIn terms of physical risks, we referenced the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) published by a generic scientific body similar to the IPCC in 2021 and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes in the future. We also adopted a generic scenario framework, such as the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP), to derive GHG emissions under different social and economic landscapes.

In 2022, we continued to enhance our understanding of climate-related risks and significantly strengthened our stress testing and scenario analysis abilities for a range of management scenarios that are more plausible.\n\nClimate-related risk and opportunities identified: We have assessed the impact of Climate Risk on our business using scenario analysis over a 30-year time horizon, which has enabled us to identify and mitigate climate risks which may manifest. Sustainability and climate change have moved from being predominantly risk-based initiatives to becoming a value driver. This gives us an opportunity to deploy our market and industry knowledge to advise our clients on their individual sustainability journeys. Sustainable finance is an opportunity to both defend our existing business from Transition Risk and to fund our clients' transition from a high-carbon present to a low-carbon future. Through supporting clients on their net zero journeys and providing further finance to clients as they adapt to be less carbon intensive and emitting over time, we help mitigate their, and our, Transition Risk. Our aim to achieve Sustainable Finance income of $1 billion by 2025 and to mobilize $300 billion of Sustainable Finance by 2030 are measures of this success. We do not fully disclose impacts on financial planning and performance (including proportions of income, costs, and balance sheet related to climate-related opportunities), detailed Climate Risk exposures for all sectors and geographies, or physical risk metrics. Data limitations, and our plans to mitigate these, are discussed in greater detail in the report.\n\nSignificant concentrations of credit exposure to carbon-related assets: We have disclosed our exposures to high-carbon sectors, which includes the expected credit losses on these balances as well as the maturity profiles associated with them. Our exposure to high-carbon sectors makes up 14.4% of our loan balances. We aim to become net zero in our financed emissions by 2050, with interim 2030 targets for our highest emitting sectors. In 2022, we made progress towards this goal and set out to measure, manage, and reduce emissions starting with our most carbon-intensive sectors, in line with our net zero roadmap.

        "output": "Our company's Approach to Managing Risks:\nRisk management in our organization encompasses all functions, including identifying risks related to financial and market performance, operational efficiency, emergency preparedness and response, environmental compliance, and regulatory impacts. We prioritize risks based on their potential impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being an integral part of this process.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments evaluate domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are evaluated as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is consulted to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In situations where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For instance, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where feasible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, our reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

We have reviewed potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. We have considered raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts that could result from global climate-related impacts. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management discusses which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success. We also consult external stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us in focusing on specific areas. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. ISO 14001 defines an environmental aspect as an element of an organization's activities, products, or services that has or may have an impact on the environment. Our significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system. Each environmental aspect, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, is ranked from 0 through 4 based on criteria like severity, magnitude, probability, frequency, controllability, duration, employee concerns, community concerns, boundaries, business impact, and regulatory. The highest scores identify our significant impacts, which we focus on in more detail in our environmental management systems.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with global climate targets to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our suppliers of raw materials. As a global organization, we rely on various suppliers for raw materials, some of which may be subject to supply constraints due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the production of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nWe assess upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nWe assess downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward certain business areas due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance.

As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner.

However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\nWe assess downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

        "input": "Answer the following questions: \n1. Managing climate-related risk and opportunities\n",
        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the U.S., Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers.

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business sector has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. Our strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For example, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a previous year. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nThe collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our water strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in a certain country has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers.

The framework consists of three strategic pillars, each with a clear connection to our business strategy. In each pillar, we have identified focus areas where our company can make a significant impact.\n\nWe are confident that our new ESG strategic framework and our long-term goals to decrease carbon emissions and promote an inclusive transition are essential for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and discharge our fiduciary duties. This framework will enable us to manage risk over the long term while contributing to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Given that transition risk represents the most immediate and impactful financial risk, we have initiated an analysis of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio. This analysis focused on investments where our company holds significant influence over the investment process. Preliminary reports were generated using climate-related data and metrics provided through a vendor tool. This process allows us to identify the carbon contributions of various sectors and determine the most carbon-intensive companies in our investment portfolio. We have also calculated the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) for the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes in our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in markets with varying levels of development. Some markets boast diversified, service-led economies and mature financial markets, while others rely more on primary and energy-intensive industries. Emerging markets have a greater dependence on fossil fuels for their energy generation and less developed financial systems. The energy transition in these regions is expected to progress at a slower pace than in advanced economies. This was emphasized by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), during a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. Mr. Menon stated that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs, and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nFor our company, this implies that while we are committed to reducing carbon emissions in our investment portfolio, we recognize the importance of implementing this strategy in a manner that acknowledges the unique characteristics of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition equitably. Our commitment to an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We understand the significance of coalition building in driving an inclusive transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we collaborate with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale up domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition.

We plan to voluntarily conduct scenario tests issued by regulators, such as the Bank of England\u2019s exploratory climate risk scenario for banks and insurers in 2021.\n\nMany organizations have established targets in line with global climate agreements. Our company is currently evaluating comparable targets regarding the carbon emissions from our investments, given their significance within our overall emissions profile, and our dedication to decarbonizing our investment portfolio.\n\nIn the interim, we remain committed to raising the bar in relation to our own emissions footprint. This year, we have established new and challenging targets for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, with the goal of achieving net carbon neutrality across these two scopes by the end of 2030. More information on the environmental impact of our direct operations can be found on page 46.\n\nDuring 2021, we will continue to expand our engagement strategy with key policy and political stakeholders around major climate conferences, focusing on financial sector issues to support the just transition and sustainable finance priorities, particularly in emerging markets. We also acknowledge that implementing our strategic ESG framework can generate opportunities for our company. Some of these opportunities will stem from our proactive actions against the climate risks we identify, including integrating transition risk into investment decisions to minimize the risk of holding stranded assets. Others will arise through supporting a fair transition. The infrastructure and capital expenditure required to facilitate the transition presents attractive investment opportunities in numerous cases. For instance, institutions can both create new products and invest in structures and mechanisms that enable a phased reduction of dependence on coal-powered electricity within developing economies. In response to this, our company has developed several responsible investment products that direct our customers\u2019 savings towards ESG-themed investments. More information on our ESG-related investment activities can be found in the Responsible Investment section on page 34.\n\nA review is underway to establish suitable targets regarding the carbon emissions from our investment portfolio. We are also investigating additional environmental/climate risk opportunities, such as the development of investment, insurance, and digital products to address climate risk."

Due to challenges in data sourcing and processes, there have been impacts on certain climate disclosures.\n\nClimate scenario analysis is used as a risk assessment tool to provide insights on the long-term effects of transition and physical risks across our corporate and retail banking portfolios, as well as our own operations. Our sustainable finance initiative enables sustainable infrastructure and energy systems, promotes decarbonisation efforts across the real economy, and enhances investor capital through sustainable investment.\n\nWe aim to achieve net zero in our financed emissions by 2050 and in our own operations and supply chain by 2030. We aim to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn of sustainable finance and investment for our customers in their transition to net zero and a sustainable future.\n\nOur assessment of climate risks covers three distinct time periods: short term (up to 2025), medium term (2026 to 2035), and long term (2036 to 2050). Transition or physical climate-related issues identified are assessed using enhanced questionnaires and scoring tools.\n\nWe support our customers in their transition through our sustainable finance and investment initiative. Our sustainable finance data dictionary includes a detailed definition of contributing activities.\n\nCertain perils, such as coastal, river, and surface water flooding, drive potential credit losses in our retail portfolio. Around 20% of our financed properties are in a major city, and most are protected by a flood barrier.\n\nWe identified six key sectors with the highest exposure to climate transition risk: automotive, chemicals, construction and building materials, metals and mining, oil and gas, and power and utilities. We continued to improve our identification and assessment of climate risk within our retail mortgage portfolio, with increased investments in physical risk data and enhancements to our internal risk assessment capabilities and models.\n\nOpportunities include sustainable finance, sustainable investment, and sustainable infrastructure. For a detailed breakdown of our sustainable finance progress by geography, see the ESG Data Pack.\n\nWe report our exposure to high transition risk sectors in our wholesale portfolio. Since 2020, we have rolled out the questionnaire to include our largest customers in the next highest climate transition risk sectors: agriculture, industrials, real estate, and transportation.\n\nAs a result of climate scenario analysis, our largest and most impacted sectors \u2013 power and utilities, construction and building materials, and chemicals \u2013 are subject to increased levels of transition risks. Our asset management division is increasingly considering both physical and transition risks and integrating ESG and climate analysis into the investment decision-making process.\n\nTransition to net zero represents one of our strategic pillars. We aim to be net zero in our operations and supply chain by 2030 and in our financed emissions by 2050. Scenario analysis supports our strategy by assessing our position under a range of climate scenarios and helping us plan for the future and meet growing regulatory requirements.\n\nWe continue to develop our climate scenario analysis exercises to have a more comprehensive understanding of climate headwinds, risks, and opportunities that will support our strategic planning and actions. We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of climate-related issues on financial planning, particularly the impact on financial performance and financial position. We expect to further enhance our disclosure and processes in relation to acquisitions/divestments in the medium term.\n\nClimate change poses a physical risk to the buildings we occupy as an organization, including offices, retail branches, and data centers. We use stress testing to evaluate the potential impact to our owned or leased premises. Our scenario stress test, conducted in 2022, analyzed how seven different climate change-related hazards could impact 500 of our critical and important buildings.\n\nOur Climate Solutions Partnership is a philanthropic initiative that aims to identify and remove barriers to scale for climate change solutions. We support start-up companies developing carbon-cutting technologies, nature-based solutions, renewable energy initiatives, and the WWF-led Asia Sustainable Palm Oil Links programme.\n\nDuring Board meetings, we balance discussions on the company's performance, emerging risks, and duties to shareholders while remaining conscious of responsibilities to support communities and help customers. In 2022, the Board approved an update to the thermal coal phase-out policy and the publication of an updated energy policy. We have committed to publishing our own climate transition plan in 2023."

It enhances our awareness of climate change, enables us to prepare for the future, and assists us in meeting our growing regulatory requirements. \u2013 In 2022, we conducted our initial internal climate scenario analysis exercise, employing four scenarios to represent the spectrum of potential climate change outcomes. The analysis focused on the key regions where our company operates and assessed the impact on our balance sheet between the 2022 and 2050 time frame. Key performance drivers and their consideration \u2013 Climate scenario analysis allows our company to model the potential impact of different climate pathways on our customers and portfolios, particularly concerning credit losses. Under the Current Commitments scenario, we anticipate moderate levels of losses related to transition risks. However, physical risk losses are expected to increase in later years due to the rise in global warming.\n\nScenarios employed and their implications for government policies \u2013 The assumptions for our climate stress testing exercise encompass varying levels of governmental climate policy changes, macroeconomic factors, and technological developments. However, the success of these scenarios hinges on the development of technologies that are still uncertain, such as global hydrogen production to decarbonize aviation and shipping. For more information on the assumptions, please refer to our ESG Data Pack.\n\nPossible adjustments and adaptations to our strategies \u2013 The nature of the scenarios, our evolving capabilities, and the limitations of the analysis result in indicative outcomes of climate change headwinds, although they do not represent a definitive forecast. \u2013 Advancements in climate science, data, methodology, and scenario analysis techniques will help us refine our approach further. Consequently, our perspective on risk is expected to evolve over time. \u2013 Our company intends to continue enhancing our capabilities for climate scenario analysis and employ the results for decision-making, primarily in relation to strategy. We plan to utilize the range of scenario analysis outcomes to shape our strategy across business units and regions. \u2013 At present, we do not fully disclose the quantitative impacts of transition and physical risks due to transitional challenges, including data limitations and evolving science and methodologies."

Our transition risk assessment concentrates on the sectors of electric utilities and oil, gas & coal in Japan. The analysis timeframe spans until 2050, although the International Energy Agency (IEA) scenario only extends to 2040. The estimated cost increases under dynamic and static scenarios are approximately \u00a5120 billion and \u00a5310 billion, respectively. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios we considered are 8.5 (4\u00b0C) and 2.6 (2\u00b0C).\n\nIn evaluating potential impacts on our clients' businesses, we applied two scenarios: a static scenario, which assumes no change in the existing business structure, and a dynamic scenario, under which the business structure adapts to the transformation. Our analysis primarily focused on credit costs through 2050.\n\nWe utilized a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the rates at which typhoons and other storms result in wind and water-related building loss or damage. We then analyzed the potential direct (collateral value) and indirect (business stagnation) impacts on our company's credit costs from the loss or damage of mortgaged real estate (buildings) in Japan. This analysis targeted middle-market firms and SMEs in Japan. The impact on mortgage lending value was minimal, while the impact of business stagnation was \u00a552 billion at most under both 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C scenarios."

This includes expenses on energy conservation or carbon reduction facilities, more expensive renewable energy or RECs, carbon credits, and additional costs due to uncertainties in the development of new energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies.\n\nPhysical risks mainly focus on growing electricity costs due to chronic climate changes, such as rising temperatures. Costs related to combating drought include expenses for building water reclamation systems, using reclaimed water, and purchasing backup water sources. For acute climate change disasters like floods and strong winds, we have already designed prevention systems into our facilities and will not be calculating their financial impact.\n\nOur company has also estimated the cost of reputation damage from failing to meet net zero emission targets. However, there is no globally recognized approach to estimate such financial impact, and these calculations are subject to uncertainty. The financial impact of a 1% revenue reduction was a consensus reached by experts after discussions and assessments.\n\nThe financial impact of climate opportunities includes reduced costs from increased energy and water use efficiency and diverse water sources, as well as additional income from providing low-carbon products and services. These may include advanced manufacturing processes, Power Management ICs (PMICs), and ultralow power (ULP) ICs.\n\nAnalysis results indicate that developing low-carbon products and services presents the greatest opportunity for positive financial impacts, as demands for such products continue to grow."

Furthermore, we have incorporated the potential increase in carbon emissions from expanding our operations and new facilities, as well as existing carbon reduction measures, into our evaluations to examine the potential financial consequences of climate risks. Previously, we assessed climate risks based on the worst-case scenario alone. However, the future of climate change is uncertain, and as a result, we have chosen to evaluate climate risks under multiple scenarios this year to help shape and communicate internal strategies, as well as to offer a comprehensive understanding of climate trends over the medium-to-long term.\n\nClimate Scenario Selection\nRegarding transition risks, there is now a global agreement that carbon pricing mechanisms are essential for achieving net zero emissions. We consulted the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO), an IEA report widely used by companies worldwide, and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to conduct climate risk analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing serves as the foundation for us to evaluate the effects of carbon pricing schemes on our operations in various countries.\n\nIn terms of physical risks, we consulted the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) published by IPCC in 2021 and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes in the future. We also adopted the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) to derive GHG emissions under different social and economic contexts.

For climate scenario analysis, we can run 30-year scenarios for both Physical and Transition Risk. Some elements of our Physical Risk scenario analysis can also extend to the end of the century.\n\nProcesses used to determine material risks and opportunities: We utilize a range of tools and methodologies to assess Transition and Physical Climate Risk for our clients, portfolios, and our own operations. These include scenario analysis, location-based hazard and risk scores, temperature alignment scores, and third-party risk assessment tools (acute physical risk impact assessments). In addition, we engage with our corporate clients to understand their transition and physical risks, as well as their plans to prepare for climate change. In 2022, we continued to enhance our understanding of climate-related risks and significantly strengthened our stress testing and scenario analysis abilities for a range of management scenarios that are more plausible.\n\nClimate-related risk and opportunities identified: We have assessed the impact of Climate Risk on our business using scenario analysis over a 30-year time horizon, which has enabled us to identify and mitigate climate risks which may manifest. Sustainability and climate change have moved from being predominantly risk-based initiatives to becoming a value driver. This gives us an opportunity to deploy our market and industry knowledge to advise our clients on their individual sustainability journeys. Sustainable finance is an opportunity to both defend our existing business from Transition Risk and to fund our clients' transition from a high-carbon present to a low-carbon future. Through supporting clients on their net zero journeys and providing further finance to clients as they adapt to be less carbon intensive and emitting over time, we help mitigate their, and our, Transition Risk. Our aim to achieve Sustainable Finance income of $1 billion by 2025 and to mobilize $300 billion of Sustainable Finance by 2030 are measures of this success. We do not fully disclose impacts on financial planning and performance (including proportions of income, costs, and balance sheet related to climate-related opportunities), detailed Climate Risk exposures for all sectors and geographies, or physical risk metrics. Data limitations, and our plans to mitigate these, are discussed in greater detail in the report.\n\nSignificant concentrations of credit exposure to carbon-related assets: We have disclosed our exposures to high-carbon sectors, which includes the expected credit losses on these balances as well as the maturity profiles associated with them. Our exposure to high-carbon sectors makes up 14.4% of our loan balances. We aim to become net zero in our financed emissions by 2050, with interim 2030 targets for our highest emitting sectors. In 2022, we made progress towards this goal and set out to measure, manage, and reduce emissions starting with our most carbon-intensive sectors, in line with our net zero roadmap."

Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being part of this process.\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is consulted to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with global climate agreements to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In situations where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the production of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For instance, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where feasible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, our reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. ISO 14001 defines an environmental aspect as an element of an organization's activities, products, or services that has or may have an impact on the environment. Our significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system. Each environmental aspect, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, is ranked from 0 through 4 based on criteria like severity, magnitude, probability, frequency, controllability, duration, employee concerns, community concerns, boundaries, business impact, and regulatory. The highest scores identify our significant impacts, which we focus on in more detail in our environmental management systems.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our suppliers of raw materials. As a global organization, we rely on various suppliers for raw materials, some of which may be subject to supply constraints due to climate change. In instances where we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the production of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruptions. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the impact climate change could have on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a $1 million USD threshold to determine potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nWe assess downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward our semiconductor business due to the anticipated increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies that use our products (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)."

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a benchmark year. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area.

We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs.

Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis.

The frameworks link our risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system.\n\nOur risk management process targets the early identification and assessment of risks and opportunities that could materially impact our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is generally three years, and we employ a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities that remain after the implementation of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a systematic manner, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting typically follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to expeditiously address critical issues.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on impact and probability, taking into account various viewpoints, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down aspect ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at various management levels and are incorporated into the subsequent reporting process, if deemed relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are consolidated within and for each of the departments mentioned. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. Our response strategies encompass avoidance, transfer, reduction, acceptance, and capitalizing on opportunities. For each risk or opportunity, responsibility entails the development, initiation, and monitoring of suitable response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures are specifically designed to enable effective risk management.\n\nOur company manages various risks, including those related to economic conditions and customer demand, project risks, and risks from the transmission of infectious agents. We closely monitor macroeconomic trends and developments in relevant industries to address the risk of economic instability and shifting customer demand.

Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. The first step in assuming responsibility for a risk or opportunity involves selecting one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies for risks include avoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance. Our general response strategy for opportunities is to \"seize\" the opportunity. In the second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures must be tailored to enable effective risk management.\n\nWe have developed various response measures with distinct characteristics. For instance, we mitigate the risk of currency and interest rate fluctuations through hedging activities. In managing our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, provisional acceptances during project execution, and clearly defined approval processes helps us identify and respond to project risks early, even before the bidding phase. Additionally, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential damage and liability risks to minimize our exposure to such risks and avoid or mitigate potential losses.\n\nWe address the risk of economic activity and customer demand fluctuations by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries and adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures as necessary.\n\nGlobal risks include the transmission of infectious agents from animals to humans, from humans to humans, and in other ways. Epidemics, pandemics, or other spread patterns, such as bioterrorism, pose a threat to causing high disease rates in different countries, regions, or continents. We continually monitor information from the World Health Organization (WHO), the American and European Centers for Disease Control, the German Robert Koch Institute, and other institutions to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible."

This framework aligns with our business strategy and our mission to help individuals maximize their potential, build wealth, and achieve their financial goals. The framework consists of three strategic pillars, each with a clear connection to our business strategy. Within these pillars, specific focus areas have been identified where our company can make a significant impact.\n\nWe are confident that this new ESG framework and our long-term goals to decrease carbon emissions and promote an inclusive transition will meet stakeholder expectations and uphold our fiduciary responsibilities. The framework will enable us to manage risk over the long term and contribute to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Acknowledging that transition risk poses the most immediate and impactful financial risk, we have assessed the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio. This analysis focused on investments where our company holds significant influence. Preliminary reports were generated using climate-related data and metrics from a proprietary vendor tool. This process allows for a sector-by-sector breakdown of carbon footprint metrics and identification of the most carbon-intensive companies in our investment portfolio. We have also calculated the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) for the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes in our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in markets with varying levels of development. Some markets boast diversified, service-led economies and advanced financial systems, while others rely heavily on primary and energy-intensive industries. In emerging markets, the energy transition is likely to progress more slowly than in advanced economies. This was emphasized by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), during a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. Mr. Menon stated that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs, and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are dedicated to reducing carbon emissions in our investment portfolio, we recognize the importance of implementing this strategy in a manner that acknowledges the unique challenges of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition equitably. Our commitment to an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities to all stakeholders. We understand the significance of collaboration in driving an inclusive transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we collaborate with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group our company has co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to generate new ideas for scaling up investments to further the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."

Due to challenges in data sourcing and processes, there have been impacts on certain climate disclosures.\n\nClimate scenario analysis is used as a risk assessment tool to provide insights on the long-term effects of transition and physical risks across our corporate and retail portfolios, as well as our own operations. Our sustainable finance ambition enables sustainable infrastructure and energy systems, promotes decarbonisation efforts across the real economy, and enhances investor capital through sustainable investment.\n\nWe aim to achieve net zero in our financed emissions by 2050 and in our own operations and supply chain by 2030. We aim to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn of sustainable finance and investment for our customers in their transition to net zero and a sustainable future.\n\nOur assessment of climate risks covers three distinct time periods: short term (up to 2025), medium term (2026 to 2035), and long term (2036 to 2050). Transition or physical climate-related issues identified are assessed using enhanced questionnaires and scoring tools.\n\nWe support our customers in their transition through our sustainable finance and investment ambition. Our sustainable finance data dictionary includes a detailed definition of contributing activities.\n\nCertain perils, such as coastal, river, and surface water flooding, drive potential credit losses in our retail portfolio. Around 20% of our financed properties are in London, and most are protected by the Thames Barrier.\n\nWe identified six key sectors with the highest exposure to climate transition risk: automotive, chemicals, construction and building materials, metals and mining, oil and gas, and power and utilities. We continued to improve our identification and assessment of climate risk within our retail mortgage portfolio, with increased investments in physical risk data and enhancements to our internal risk assessment capabilities and models.\n\nOpportunities include sustainable finance, sustainable investment, and sustainable infrastructure. For a detailed breakdown of our sustainable finance progress by geography, see the ESG Data Pack.\n\nWe report our exposure to high transition risk sectors in our wholesale portfolio. Since 2020, we have rolled out the questionnaire to include our largest customers in the next highest climate transition risk sectors: agriculture, industrials, real estate, and transportation.\n\nAs a result of climate scenario analysis, our largest and most impacted sectors \u2013 power and utilities, construction and building materials, and chemicals \u2013 are subject to increased levels of transition risks. Our asset management division is increasingly considering both physical and transition risks and integrating ESG and climate analysis into the investment decision-making process.\n\nTransition to net zero represents one of our strategic pillars. We aim to be net zero in our operations and supply chain by 2030 and in our financed emissions by 2050. Scenario analysis supports our strategy by assessing our position under a range of climate scenarios and helping us plan for the future and meet growing regulatory requirements.\n\nWe continue to develop our climate scenario analysis exercises to have a more comprehensive understanding of climate headwinds, risks, and opportunities that will support our strategic planning and actions. We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of climate-related issues on financial planning, particularly the impact on financial performance and financial position. We expect to further enhance our disclosure and processes in relation to acquisitions/divestments in the medium term.\n\nClimate change poses a physical risk to the buildings we occupy as an organization, including offices, retail branches, and data centers. We use stress testing to evaluate the potential impact to our owned or leased premises. Our scenario stress test, conducted in 2022, analyzed how seven different climate change-related hazards could impact 500 of our critical and important buildings.\n\nOur Climate Solutions Partnership is a philanthropic initiative that aims to identify and remove barriers to scale for climate change solutions. We support start-up companies developing carbon-cutting technologies, nature-based solutions, renewable energy initiatives in Asia, and the WWF-led Asia Sustainable Palm Oil Links programme.\n\nDuring Board meetings, we balance discussions on the company's performance, emerging risks, and duties to shareholders while remaining conscious of responsibilities to support communities and help customers. In 2022, the Board approved an update to the thermal coal phase-out policy and the publication of an updated energy policy. We have committed to publishing our own climate transition plan in 2023.

It enhances our awareness of climate change, helps us prepare for the future, and meets our growing regulatory requirements. In 2022, we conducted our initial internal climate scenario analysis exercise, employing four scenarios to represent the potential outcomes of global climate change. Our analysis focused on the key regions where our company operates and evaluated the impact on our balance sheet between the 2022 and 2050 timeframe.\nKey performance drivers and their consideration:\nClimate scenario analysis allows our company to model how different climate pathways might impact our customers and portfolios, particularly in terms of credit losses. Under the Current Commitments scenario, we anticipate moderate levels of losses related to transition risks. However, physical risk losses are expected to rise in later years due to the increase in global warming.\nGovernment policies and their role in scenarios:\nThe assumptions for our climate stress testing exercise include varying levels of governmental climate policy changes, macroeconomic factors, and technological developments. However, the success of these scenarios hinges on the development of uncertain technologies, such as global hydrogen production for decarbonizing aviation and shipping. For more information on the assumptions, please refer to our ESG Data Pack.\nAdapting strategies in response to climate scenarios:\nThe nature of the scenarios, our evolving capabilities, and the limitations of the analysis result in indicative outcomes of climate change headwinds, although they are not a definitive forecast. Our company intends to continue enhancing our capabilities for climate scenario analysis and use the results for decision-making, particularly in relation to strategy. By utilizing the range of scenario analysis outcomes, we aim to shape our strategy across business units and regions.\nCurrent limitations in disclosing climate impacts:\nOur company does not yet fully disclose the quantitative impacts of transition and physical risks due to challenges including data limitations and evolving science and methodologies."

Our analysis primarily focused on credit costs through 2050.\n\nWe utilized a Monte Carlo simulation to ascertain the rates at which typhoons and other storms cause wind and water-related building loss or damage. Subsequently, we analyzed the potential direct (collateral value) and indirect (business stagnation) impacts on our company's credit costs from the loss or damage of mortgaged real estate (buildings) in Japan.

This encompasses expenses related to energy conservation or carbon reduction facilities, pricier renewable energy or RECs, carbon credits, and additional costs due to uncertainties surrounding the development of new energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies.\n\nPhysical risks primarily concern themselves with escalating electricity costs due to climate changes, such as increasing temperatures. Costs associated with mitigating drought involve expenses for constructing water reclamation systems, utilizing reclaimed water, and procuring backup water sources. For extreme climate change events like floods and strong winds, we have already integrated prevention systems into our facilities and will not be calculating their financial impact.\n\nOur company has also assessed the potential cost of reputational damage resulting from failing to meet net zero emission targets. However, there is no universally accepted methodology for estimating such financial impact. The financial impact of a 1% revenue reduction was a consensus reached by experts following discussions and evaluations. The financial impact from climate opportunities includes cost savings from enhanced energy and water use efficiency and diverse water sources, as well as additional revenue from offering low-carbon products and services such as 7nm or more advanced processes, Power Management ICs (PMICs), and ultralow power (ULP) ICs.\n\nThe findings from our analysis suggest that the development of low-carbon products and services presents the most significant opportunity for positive financial impacts, as the demand for low-carbon products and advanced manufacturing processes continues to expand."

In addition, we have also included potential growth in carbon emissions from expanding our business and new facilities as well as existing carbon reduction actions into general evaluations to analyze the potential financial impacts of climate risks. In the past, we evaluated climate risks solely using the worst-case scenario, but the future of climate change is highly unpredictable. As such, we have opted to evaluate climate risks across several scenarios this year to help map out and communicate operations strategies internally and give comprehensive insights into climate trends over the mid-to-long term.\n\nClimate Scenario Selection\nIn terms of transition risks, there is now a global consensus that carbon pricing schemes are a necessary policy to achieve net zero emissions. We have referred to the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO), an IEA report commonly used by companies, and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to conduct climate scenario analysis on future carbon pricing.

For climate scenario analysis, we can run 30-year scenarios for both Physical and Transition Risk. Some elements of our Physical Risk scenario analysis can also extend to the end of the century.\n\nProcesses used to determine material risks and opportunities: We utilize a range of tools and methodologies to assess Transition and Physical Climate Risk for our clients, portfolios, and our own operations. These include scenario analysis, location-based hazard and risk scores, temperature alignment scores, and Munich Re's NATHAN tool (acute physical risk impact assessments). In addition, we engage with our corporate clients to understand their transition and physical risks, as well as their plans to prepare for climate change. In 2022, we continued to enhance our understanding of climate-related risks and significantly strengthened our stress testing and scenario analysis abilities for a range of management scenarios that are more plausible.\n\nClimate-related risk and opportunities identified: We have assessed the impact of Climate Risk on our business using scenario analysis over a 30-year time horizon, which has enabled us to identify and mitigate climate risks which may manifest. Sustainability and climate change have moved from being predominantly risk-based initiatives to becoming a value driver. This gives us an opportunity to deploy our market and industry knowledge to advise our clients on their individual sustainability journeys. Sustainable finance is an opportunity to both defend our existing business from Transition Risk and to fund our clients' transition from a high-carbon present to a low-carbon future. Through supporting clients on their net zero journeys and providing further finance to clients as they adapt to be less carbon intensive and emitting over time, we help mitigate their, and our, Transition Risk.

Outline the manner in which climate-related risks and prospects influence an organization's business functions, strategic objectives, and financial forecasting.\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities can significantly impact an organization's operations, strategic trajectory, and financial planning in various ways.\n\nFirst, climate-related risks can materialize as physical risks, such as extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and natural disasters, which can disrupt supply chains, damage infrastructure, and result in production losses. These risks can also manifest as transition risks, arising from regulatory changes, technological advancements, and shifts in market preferences, which can impact an organization's competitiveness and profitability.\n\nSecond, climate-related opportunities can present themselves as new markets, innovative technologies, and regulatory incentives that can create revenue streams, reduce costs, and enhance an organization's reputation. For instance, the transition to a low-carbon economy can create opportunities for businesses that offer green products and services, while regulatory initiatives, such as carbon pricing, can provide financial incentives for organizations to reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nThird, climate-related risks and opportunities can influence an organization's strategic direction by altering market dynamics, regulatory requirements, and stakeholder expectations. For example, a shift towards a low-carbon economy can necessitate changes in an organization's business model, product offerings, and partnerships, while stakeholder expectations regarding climate action can impact an organization's reputation and brand value.\n\nFourth, climate-related risks and opportunities can impact an organization's financial planning by requiring new investments, cost savings, and revenue streams. For instance, organizations may need to invest in renewable energy infrastructure, energy efficiency measures, and climate risk assessments to mitigate climate-related risks and capitalize on climate-related opportunities. Similarly, organizations may be able to save costs by reducing energy consumption, optimizing supply chains, and implementing circular business models.\n\nIn conclusion, climate-related risks and opportunities can have far-reaching implications for an organization's business operations, strategic direction, and financial planning. Understanding these implications is crucial for organizations to effectively manage climate risks, seize climate opportunities, and contribute to a sustainable future.",

We prioritize risks based on their impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being part of this process.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use a substantial amount as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is interviewed to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption. We use a substantial amount as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\n\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use a substantial amount as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, our reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences.

Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business focuses on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. Our strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization.\n\nWe are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. In this year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a benchmark year. This program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nWe evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nOur company's Water Strategy is complementary to the physical risk assessment process. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. We analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations.

One of the Group ESG Committee's responsibilities is to oversee our progress towards fulfilling our commitment to report against the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In 2020, the Group ESG Committee reported to the Board through the Nomination & Governance Committee.\n\nOur policies and procedures for managing ESG issues are outlined in our Group Governance Manual (GGM). The GGM is subject to an annual formal content review, taking into consideration internal and external factors. Any instances of GGM non-compliance identified through annual attestations are assessed by policy owners and reported to the Group Audit Committee.\n\nOur company is committed to implementing our new strategic ESG framework and long-term goals to decarbonize our investment portfolio and support an inclusive transition. This approach is essential for meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary obligations. This approach will reduce our exposure to asset risk, including transition risk, over time, while also contributing to global decarbonization efforts. Our Risk function conducted an initial transition risk analysis on insurance assets managed in segregated portfolios by our asset managers. This analysis focused on investments where we maintain direct control and exert influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to our overall carbon footprint metrics and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded. It also enables the identification and monitoring of the most carbon-intensive companies held in our asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of our listed equity and corporate bond asset classes.\n\nOur Board's oversight of climate change risk has been significantly strengthened. In 2020, ESG was overseen by the Board through the Nomination & Governance Committee. In early 2021, a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group was established to ensure appropriate Board engagement and oversight of ESG matters (including climate change). A Board Risk Committee workshop was held to evaluate the climate change risks facing our organization, discuss transition and physical risk concepts, and review potential Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)."

This framework is fully aligned to our business strategy and our purpose of helping people to get the most out of life, accumulate wealth, and save for their goals. The key features of our ESG framework include its three strategic pillars, which have clear alignment with our business strategy. Within each of these, specific differentiating focus areas have been identified where our company can make a meaningful impact.\n\nWe believe that the new strategic ESG framework and the long-term goals to reduce carbon emissions and support an inclusive transition are an important way for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and fulfill our fiduciary obligations. It will help us manage risk over time, while also contributing to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Recognizing that transition risk represents the nearest-term and most impactful financial risk, we have conducted an initial analysis of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio. This analysis focused on investments where our company maintains control and exerts influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to the overall carbon footprint metrics of the asset book and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors. It also enables us to determine and monitor the most carbon-intensive companies held in the asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes of our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in markets with varying levels of development. Some markets have diversified, service-led economies and mature financial markets, while others are more dependent on primary and energy-intensive industries. These emerging markets have a greater reliance on fossil fuels in their generation mix and less developed financial systems. The energy transition across the region is likely to proceed at a slower pace than for advanced economies. This point was highlighted by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of a Central Bank (CB), speaking at a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. Mr. Menon noted that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are committed to an objective to reduce carbon emissions in our investment portfolio, we are mindful of the need to implement the strategy in a way that acknowledges the nature of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition in a fair manner. Our support for an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We recognize the importance of coalition building in delivering an inclusive transition. As a member of a Sustainable Development Partnership (SDP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we work with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group we have co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to catalyze new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."

I will primarily focus on the role of governance structures and strategic planning in addressing environmental challenges.\n\nQuestion 1:\nClimate-related risks and opportunities can significantly impact an organization's business operations, strategic direction, and financial planning in several ways. First, they can influence the organization's risk profile, as extreme weather events, regulatory changes, and shifting market trends can lead to increased costs, operational disruptions, and reputational damage. Second, they can affect the organization's strategic direction, as companies may need to adapt to new market conditions, regulatory requirements, and customer preferences related to climate change. Lastly, they can impact financial planning, as organizations may need to allocate resources to mitigate climate risks, invest in low-carbon technologies, and respond to changing market dynamics.\n\nTherefore, it is crucial for organizations to disclose their climate-related risks and opportunities transparently and accurately to stakeholders, enabling them to make informed decisions about the organization's financial stability and long-term sustainability.

        "instruction": "Using your proficiency in the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) framework, let me propose a comprehensive strategy for creating resilient disclosures. These disclosures should not only adhere to TCFD guidelines but also bolster an organization's approach to managing climate-related risks and seizing opportunities.\n\nTo begin, it is essential to acknowledge the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on an organization's core business operations, strategic objectives, and financial projections.\n\n1. Identify the ways in which climate-related risks and opportunities shape the organization's business activities. This may include assessing the potential physical risks, such as extreme weather events or sea-level rise, as well as transitional risks, such as regulatory changes or shifts in market preferences.\n2. Evaluate how these risks and opportunities align with the organization's strategic goals. For instance, does the organization's strategy include plans to mitigate or adapt to climate-related risks? Are there opportunities to capitalize on emerging low-carbon technologies or markets?\n3. Integrate climate-related considerations into the organization's financial forecasts. This may involve quantifying the financial impact of climate-related risks and opportunities, such as the cost of adapting to physical risks or the revenue potential of new low-carbon business opportunities.\n\nBy following this detailed approach, organizations can develop robust disclosures that not only meet TCFD guidelines but also provide valuable insights into their climate-related risks and opportunities, enhancing their overall strategic response.",

        "output": "After implementing the instructions, the text becomes:\n\nFollowing our ESG review, we have developed a new ESG Strategic Framework (the 'framework'). This framework is fully aligned to our business strategy and our purpose of helping people to get the most out of life, accumulate wealth, and save for their goals. The key features of our ESG framework are its three strategic pillars, which have clear alignment with our business strategy. Within each of these, specific differentiating focus areas have been identified where we believe our company can make a meaningful impact.\n\nWe believe that the new strategic ESG framework and the long-term goals to decarbonise our investment portfolio and support an inclusive transition are an important way for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and fulfill our fiduciary obligations. It will reduce our exposure to asset risk, including transition risk, over time, while also contributing to global decarbonisation efforts. Recognising that transition risk represents the nearest-term and most impactful financial risk, we have conducted an initial transition risk analysis on our investment assets. This analysis focused on investments where our company maintains direct control and exerts influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to the overall carbon footprint metrics of our investment portfolio and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded. It also enables us to determine and monitor the most carbon-intensive companies held in our investment portfolio. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of our listed equity and corporate bond asset classes.\n\nOur company operates in various markets, including highly developed economies with diversified, service-led economies and mature financial markets, and emerging markets that are more dependent on primary and energy-intensive industries. These emerging markets have a greater reliance on fossil fuels in their generation mix and less developed financial systems. The energy transition across the region is likely to proceed at a slower pace than for advanced economies. This point was highlighted by a senior official from a central bank in the region. Speaking at a financial conference, he noted that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are committed to an objective to decarbonise our investment portfolio, we are mindful of the need to implement the strategy in a way that acknowledges the nature of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition in a fair manner. Our support for an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We recognise the importance of coalition building in delivering an inclusive transition. As a member of a partnership coordinated by a global organization, we work with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition.

In response to your inquiry, I will:\n\n1. Disclose the organization's Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions encompassing Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if relevant, Scope 3, outlining the associated risks related to these emissions.\n\nIn essence, organizations need to adopt a more holistic and forward-thinking approach to climate risk management. This involves not only measuring and reporting their GHG emissions in accordance with the TCFD framework but also setting ambitious targets to reduce these emissions and align with a low-carbon future.\n\nTo begin, it is crucial for organizations to accurately quantify and disclose their Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if applicable, Scope 3 GHG emissions. Scope 1 emissions represent direct emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the organization. Scope 2 emissions stem from the purchase of electricity, heat, or steam. Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions from sources not owned or controlled by the reporting organization but result from the organization's activities.\n\nBy acknowledging and addressing these emissions, organizations can identify and mitigate the associated risks, such as regulatory compliance, reputational damage, and potential physical risks to their operations. Moreover, by setting ambitious targets to reduce these emissions, organizations can demonstrate their commitment to climate action and position themselves as leaders in their industries.\n\nIn conclusion, the TCFD framework provides a robust and globally recognized framework for organizations to disclose climate-related financial information.

        "instruction": "As an expert in the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) framework, I will offer a comprehensive guide on how to effectively assess and communicate climate-related risks and prospects for an organization. I will focus on the significance of governance, strategic alignment, and risk management practices in this context.\n\nFirst, let me address the influence of climate-related risks and opportunities on an organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning. Climate-related risks and opportunities can significantly impact an organization's operations, strategic direction, and financial projections. These risks and opportunities may stem from various sources, such as regulatory requirements, physical risks, transition risks, and reputational risks.\n\nPhysical risks refer to the direct consequences of climate change on an organization's assets and operations. For instance, a company with significant exposure to coastal regions may face risks from sea-level rise, storm surges, or other extreme weather events. Transition risks, on the other hand, relate to the potential financial impact of policies and regulatory measures aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A company heavily reliant on fossil fuels, for example, may face significant financial consequences if stricter regulations are enacted or if alternative energy sources become more economically viable.\n\nReputational risks are also a concern for organizations when it comes to climate-related issues. Consumers, investors, and other stakeholders are increasingly demanding greater transparency and action from companies regarding their climate-related risks and opportunities. Failure to address these concerns can result in negative publicity, loss of market share, and damage to the organization's reputation.\n\nStrategic alignment is crucial in managing climate-related risks and opportunities. Organizations need to ensure that their business strategies are consistent with the low-carbon economy and the transition to a sustainable future. This may involve investing in renewable energy, developing low-carbon products or services, or implementing energy efficiency measures.\n\nEffective risk management practices are essential in addressing climate-related risks and opportunities. Organizations should identify, assess, and prioritize these risks and opportunities, and develop strategies to mitigate, adapt, or capitalize on them. This may involve implementing risk management policies and procedures, conducting climate risk assessments, and engaging with stakeholders on climate-related issues.\n\nIn conclusion, climate-related risks and opportunities can have a profound impact on an organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning. Effective evaluation and reporting on these risks and opportunities require a strong understanding of governance, strategic alignment, and risk management practices. By addressing these factors, organizations can better manage climate-related risks and opportunities and position themselves for success in a low-carbon economy.",

Detail the organization's procedures for recognizing and evaluating climate-related risks.\n\nTo begin, organizations should establish a clear understanding of their climate-related risks by implementing the following steps:\n\na. Identify: Conduct a comprehensive assessment of the organization's operations, supply chain, and business model to recognize climate-related risks. This may include physical risks such as extreme weather events, transition risks related to regulatory changes, and reputational risks associated with climate issues.\n\nb. Assess: Evaluate the potential impact, likelihood, and time horizon of identified climate-related risks. This information will be crucial in setting targets and establishing metrics to manage and report on these risks.\n\nc. Prioritize: Rank climate-related risks based on their potential impact on the organization's financial performance and strategic objectives. This prioritization will inform the selection of key performance indicators (KPIs) and targets for reporting climate impacts.\n\nd. Monitor: Continuously monitor and update the organization's climate-related risk assessment to ensure that disclosures remain accurate and relevant. This may involve the use of scenario analysis and stress testing to evaluate the potential financial implications of different climate scenarios.\n\n2. Establish a clear reporting framework for climate-related metrics and targets.\n\nTo effectively communicate climate-related risks and opportunities to stakeholders, organizations should establish a clear reporting framework for climate-related metrics and targets. This may include:\n\na. Aligning with TCFD recommendations: Organizations should consider the TCFD's recommendations when selecting and reporting climate-related metrics and targets. This will help ensure that disclosures are consistent with industry best practices and are easily comparable across organizations.\n\nb. Setting science-based targets: Organizations should consider setting science-based targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction in line with the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This will demonstrate the organization's commitment to addressing climate risks and contributing to a low-carbon economy.\n\nc. Establishing KPIs and targets: Organizations should establish key performance indicators (KPIs) and targets for climate-related metrics, such as greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, and water usage. These KPIs and targets should be aligned with the organization's strategic objectives and should be regularly reported to stakeholders.\n\nd. Ensuring data quality and transparency: Organizations should ensure that the data used to report climate-related metrics and targets is accurate, reliable, and transparent. This may involve the use of external verification or assurance services to validate reported data.\n\n3. Implement processes for managing and reporting on climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nTo effectively manage and report on climate-related risks and opportunities, organizations should implement the following processes:\n\na. Integrate climate considerations into decision-making: Climate considerations should be integrated into the organization's decision-making processes at all levels, from strategic planning to day-to-day operations.\n\nb. Establish a climate risk management function: Organizations should establish a climate risk management function responsible for managing and reporting on climate-related risks and opportunities. This function may be part of the organization's risk management, sustainability, or investor relations team.\n\nc. Engage stakeholders: Organizations should engage stakeholders, including investors, regulators, and industry peers, in the reporting and management of climate-related risks and opportunities. This may involve the use of industry initiatives, such as the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project), to facilitate stakeholder engagement and reporting.\n\nd. Continuously improve: Organizations should continuously improve their approach to managing and reporting on climate-related risks and opportunities. This may involve the use of scenario analysis, stress testing, and other tools to evaluate the potential financial implications of different climate scenarios and inform strategic decision-making.",

These risks can materially affect an organization's financial performance, reputation, and long-term sustainability.\n\nFor instance, a company operating in a region prone to extreme weather events may face increased insurance premiums or production disruptions due to climate-related hazards. Alternatively, a business may benefit from the adoption of renewable energy sources or the development of climate-resilient infrastructure.\n\nTo effectively manage climate-related risks and opportunities, organizations should integrate climate considerations into their governance structures, strategic planning processes, and risk management frameworks. This may involve establishing a dedicated climate risk management function, setting climate-related targets and metrics, and engaging with stakeholders on climate-related issues.\n\nMoreover, organizations should ensure that their climate-related disclosures are transparent, consistent, and comparable to enable investors and other stakeholders to make informed decisions. This can be achieved by following the TCFD recommendations, which provide a globally recognized framework for climate-related financial reporting.\n\nIn conclusion, advanced methodologies for climate-related disclosures involve recognizing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities, integrating climate considerations into governance, strategy, and risk management, and ensuring transparent, consistent, and comparable disclosures. By adopting these approaches, organizations can enhance their resilience to climate-related risks, seize opportunities in the transition to a low-carbon economy, and contribute to a more sustainable financial system.",

This includes expenses on energy conservation or carbon reduction facilities, more expensive renewable energy or RECs, carbon credits, and additional costs due to uncertainties in the development of new energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies.\n\nPhysical risks mainly focus on growing electricity costs due to chronic climate changes, such as rising temperatures. Costs related to combating drought include expenses for building water reclamation systems, using reclaimed water, and purchasing backup water sources. For acute climate change disasters like floods and strong winds, we have already designed prevention systems into our facilities and will not be calculating their financial impact.\n\nOur company has also estimated the cost of reputation damage from failing to meet net zero emission targets. However, there is no globally recognized approach to estimate such financial impact. The financial impact of a 1% revenue reduction was a consensus reached by experts after discussions and assessments.

For climate scenario analysis, we can run 30-year scenarios for both Physical and Transition Risk. Some elements of our Physical Risk scenario analysis can also extend to 2100.\n\nMethods used to identify material risks and opportunities: We utilize a range of tools and methodologies to assess Transition and Physical Climate Risk, which we apply to our clients, portfolios, and our own operations. These include scenario analysis, location-based hazard and risk scores, temperature alignment scores, and Munich Re's NATHAN tool (acute physical risk impact assessments). In addition, we engage with our corporate clients to understand their transition and physical risks, as well as their plans to prepare for climate change. In 2022, we continued to enhance our understanding of climate-related risks and significantly strengthened our stress testing and scenario analysis abilities for a range of management scenarios that are more plausible.\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities: We have assessed the impact of Climate Risk on our business using scenario analysis over a 30-year time horizon, which has enabled us to identify and mitigate climate risks which may manifest. Sustainability and climate change have moved from being predominantly risk-based initiatives to becoming a value driver. This gives us an opportunity to deploy our market and industry knowledge to advise our clients on their individual sustainability journeys. Sustainable finance is an opportunity to both defend our existing business from Transition Risk and to fund our clients' transition from a high-carbon present to a low-carbon future. Through supporting clients on their net zero journeys and providing further finance to clients as they adapt to be less carbon intensive and emitting over time, we help mitigate their, and our, Transition Risk. Our aim to achieve Sustainable Finance income of $1 billion by 2025 and to mobilize $300 billion of Sustainable Finance by 2030 are measures of this success.

I will address the following inquiries:\n\n1. Illustrate the robustness of an organization's strategy in the face of various climate-related situations, such as a 2\u00b0C or lower scenario.\n\nTo begin, let's delve into the intricacies of climate risk and its impact on an organization's strategy. In order to ensure a resilient strategy, it is crucial for companies to consider the potential consequences of diverse climate-related scenarios. One such scenario is the 2\u00b0C or lower scenario, which signifies a global temperature rise of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels or less. This scenario is significant because it is the threshold beyond which the worst effects of climate change are expected to occur.\n\nTo assess the resilience of an organization's strategy in this context, several steps can be taken:\n\na. Identify and assess climate-related risks: This involves understanding the specific risks that the organization faces due to climate change, such as physical risks (e.g., extreme weather events) and transitional risks (e.g., regulatory changes, technological disruptions).\n\nb. Develop climate-resilient strategies: Once risks have been identified, organizations can develop strategies to mitigate or adapt to these risks. This may include implementing renewable energy initiatives, improving energy efficiency, or investing in climate-resilient infrastructure.\n\nc. Monitor and report on climate-related risks and strategies: Regularly tracking and reporting on climate-related risks and strategies is essential for maintaining transparency and accountability. This information can be disclosed in TCFD reports, which provide stakeholders with valuable insights into an organization's climate risk management.\n\nBy employing these methodologies, organizations can ensure that their strategies are not only resilient to current climate conditions but also prepared for a future in which climate risks become more pronounced.",

We prioritize risks based on their impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being part of this process.\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are evaluated as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is consulted to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are engaged to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, our reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be.

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a benchmark year. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nTogether with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in a certain country has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

This year, we managed to reduce our emissions by half compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nTogether with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate on a yearly basis 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the US, Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our company's Siemens Water Tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nIn addition to our own operations, natural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

Central components of these mechanisms include enterprise-wide procedures for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning enables us to recognize potential risks prior to significant business decisions, while management reporting facilitates closer monitoring of risks as our business advances. Our internal auditors regularly evaluate the sufficiency and efficiency of our risk management, and any shortcomings can be remedied through suitable measures.\n\nOur risk management strategy is all-encompassing, dynamic, and management-focused, and is embedded within our organization. It encompasses both risks and opportunities. Our strategy adheres to globally recognized standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO 31000, and is customized to our company's specifications. The frameworks link our risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system.\n\nOur risk management process aims for early recognition and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially impact our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The timeframe is generally three years, and we employ a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities that remain following the implementation of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a systematic manner, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting typically follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues promptly.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on impact and probability, taking into account various viewpoints, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down component ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at various management levels and are incorporated into the subsequent reporting process, if deemed relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are assessed for potential cumulative effects and are consolidated within and for each of the departments mentioned. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. Our response strategies include avoidance, transfer, reduction, acceptance, and capitalizing on opportunities. For each risk or opportunity, responsibility entails the development, initiation, and monitoring of suitable response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures are specifically designed to facilitate effective risk management.\n\nOur company manages various risks, including those related to economic conditions and customer demand, project risks, and risks from the transmission of infectious agents. We closely monitor macroeconomic trends and developments in relevant industries to address the risk of economic instability and fluctuating customer demand. We maintain adequate insurance coverage for potential damage and liability risks to minimize our exposure and mitigate potential losses. We continually gather information from relevant sources to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related countermeasures as early as possible."

Our internal auditors regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management. If deficiencies are detected, appropriate measures can be adopted for their elimination. This coordination of processes and procedures is intended to help ensure that our Managing Board and Supervisory Board are fully informed about significant risks in a timely manner.\n\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-oriented, integrated into the organization, and addresses both risks and opportunities. It is based on globally accepted standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO Standard 31000, and is adapted to our requirements. The frameworks connect the risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system. They consider our strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of our business operations, the reliability of our financial reporting, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important.\n\nOur risk management process aims for early identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievement of our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing control measures.

The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed regarding potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational units mentioned above. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the hierarchical level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. In a first step, assuming responsibility for a specific risk or opportunity involves choosing one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies with respect to risks are avoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance of the relevant risk. Our general response strategy with respect to opportunities is to \"seize\" the relevant opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures have to be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates by engaging in hedging activities. Regarding our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and complemented by clearly defined approval processes, assists us in identifying and responding to project risks at an early stage, even before the bidding phase. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential cases of damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure to such risks and to avoid or minimize potential losses.\n\nWe address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries and adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary.\n\nOur company constantly checks information from reputable sources, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the American and European Centers for Disease Control, and the German Robert Koch Institute, to be able to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible.

We prioritize risks based on their potential impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being part of this process.\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess domestic and international business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are evaluated as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company employs a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is consulted to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with global climate targets to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our policies and procedures, including a Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Sourcing Policy, help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use $1 million USD as a benchmark for significant financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, our reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences. We assess market trends and technology advancements to suggest what our business focus should be. For example, we have shifted our strategic focus toward energy-efficient technologies that use our products due to the anticipated increased adoption of these technologies in response to climate change."

        "input": "Answer the following questions: \n1. Managing climate-related risk and opportunities\n",
        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business SI, for example, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. SI strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For instance, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nWith respect to our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. This year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to 2014. Among other benefits, this program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the U.S., Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tools with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

        "output": "After conducting a thorough ESG review, our company has formulated a new Strategic Framework (the 'framework') for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) matters. This framework aligns with our business strategy and our mission to help individuals maximize their potential, build wealth, and achieve their savings goals. The framework consists of three strategic pillars, each of which aligns with our business strategy. In each pillar, we have identified specific focus areas where our company can make a significant impact.\n\nOur company is dedicated to meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling our fiduciary duties through the new ESG framework and our long-term goals to decrease carbon emissions and support a fair transition. This approach will enable us to manage risk over the long term while contributing to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. We recognize that transition risk poses the most immediate and impactful financial risk and have initiated an analysis of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio. This analysis focused on investments where our company holds significant influence. Preliminary reports were generated using climate-related data and metrics supplied by a proprietary vendor tool. This process allows for a sector-by-sector breakdown of carbon footprint metrics and identification of the most carbon-intensive companies in our investment portfolio. Additionally, we have determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) for the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes in our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in markets with varying levels of development. Some markets boast diversified, service-led economies and mature financial markets, while others rely more heavily on primary and energy-intensive industries. Emerging markets have a greater dependence on fossil fuels for their energy generation and less developed financial systems. The energy transition in these regions is expected to progress more slowly than in advanced economies. This was emphasized by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), during a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. Mr. Menon stated, 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs, and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nOur commitment to reducing carbon emissions in our investment portfolio is balanced with an understanding of the unique challenges posed by the markets in which we operate. We aim to implement our strategy in a manner that acknowledges these realities and shares the financial and social burden of the transition fairly. Our support for an inclusive transition includes collaboration with various stakeholders. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we work with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale up domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group our company has co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to generate new ideas for scaling up investments to further the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."

Due to challenges in data sourcing and processes, there have been impacts on certain climate disclosures.\n\nClimate scenario analysis is used as a risk assessment tool to provide insights on the long-term effects of transition and physical risks across our corporate and retail banking portfolios, as well as our own operations. Our sustainable finance ambition enables sustainable infrastructure and energy systems, promotes decarbonisation efforts across the real economy, and enhances investor capital through sustainable investment.\n\nWe aim to achieve net zero in our financed emissions by 2050 and in our own operations and supply chain by 2030. We aim to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn of sustainable finance and investment for our customers in their transition to net zero and a sustainable future.\n\nOur assessment of climate risks covers three distinct time periods: short term (up to 2025), medium term (2026 to 2035), and long term (2036 to 2050). Transition or physical climate-related issues identified are assessed using enhanced questionnaires and scoring tools.\n\nWe support our customers in their transition through our sustainable finance and investment ambition. Our sustainable finance data dictionary includes a detailed definition of contributing activities.\n\nCertain perils, such as coastal, river, and surface water flooding, drive potential credit losses in our retail portfolio. Around 20% of our financed properties are in London, and most are protected by the Thames Barrier.\n\nWe identified six key sectors with the highest exposure to climate transition risk: automotive, chemicals, construction and building materials, metals and mining, oil and gas, and power and utilities. We continued to improve our identification and assessment of climate risk within our retail mortgage portfolio, with increased investments in physical risk data and enhancements to our internal risk assessment capabilities and models.\n\nOpportunities include sustainable finance, sustainable investment, and sustainable infrastructure. For a detailed breakdown of our sustainable finance progress by geography, see the ESG Data Pack.\n\nWe report our exposure to high transition risk sectors in our wholesale portfolio. Since 2020, we have rolled out the questionnaire to include our largest customers in the next highest climate transition risk sectors: agriculture, industrials, real estate, and transportation.\n\nAs a result of climate scenario analysis, our largest and most impacted sectors \u2013 power and utilities, construction and building materials, and chemicals \u2013 are subject to increased levels of transition risks. Our asset management division is increasingly considering both physical and transition risks and integrating ESG and climate analysis into the investment decision-making process.\n\nTransition to net zero represents one of our strategic pillars. We aim to be net zero in our operations and supply chain by 2030 and in our financed emissions by 2050. Scenario analysis supports our strategy by assessing our position under a range of climate scenarios and helping us plan for the future and meet growing regulatory requirements.\n\nWe continue to develop our climate scenario analysis exercises to have a more comprehensive understanding of climate headwinds, risks, and opportunities that will support our strategic planning and actions. We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of climate-related issues on financial planning, particularly the impact on financial performance and financial position. We expect to further enhance our disclosure and processes in relation to acquisitions/divestments in the medium term.\n\nClimate change poses a physical risk to the buildings we occupy as an organization, including offices, retail branches, and data centers. We use stress testing to evaluate the potential impact to our owned or leased premises. Our scenario stress test, conducted in 2022, analyzed how seven different climate change-related hazards could impact 500 of our critical and important buildings.\n\nOur Climate Solutions Partnership is a philanthropic initiative that aims to identify and remove barriers to scale for climate change solutions. We support start-up companies developing carbon-cutting technologies, nature-based solutions, renewable energy initiatives in Asia, and the WWF-led Asia Sustainable Palm Oil Links programme.\n\nDuring Board meetings, we balance discussions on the company's performance, emerging risks, and duties to shareholders while remaining conscious of responsibilities to support communities and help customers. In 2022, the Board approved an update to the thermal coal phase-out policy and the publication of an updated energy policy. We have committed to publishing our own climate transition plan in 2023.

        "output": "Text with placeholders:\nOur company's approach to climate scenario analysis:\nClimate scenario analysis is a crucial tool for our company, supporting our strategy by assessing our position under various climate scenarios. It enhances our awareness of climate change, helps us plan for the future, and meets our growing regulatory requirements. In 2022, we conducted our first internal climate scenario analysis exercise, employing four scenarios to represent the potential outcomes for global climate change. This analysis focused on the key regions where our company operates and evaluated the impact on our balance sheet between the 2022 and 2050 time period.\nKey drivers of performance and their consideration:\nClimate scenario analysis enables our company to model how different potential climate pathways may impact our customers and portfolios, particularly in terms of credit losses. Under the Current Commitments scenario, we anticipate moderate levels of losses related to transition risks. However, the rise in global warming will lead to increasing levels of physical risk losses in later years.\nScenarios employed and their relation to government policies:\nThe scenario assumptions for our climate stress testing exercise include varying levels of governmental climate policy changes, macroeconomic factors, and technological developments. However, these scenarios depend on the development of technologies that are still uncertain, such as global hydrogen production to decarbonize aviation and shipping. For more information on the assumptions, please refer to our ESG Data Pack.\nPossible adjustments to our strategies:\nThe nature of the scenarios, our evolving capabilities, and the limitations of the analysis result in indicative outcomes of climate change headwinds, although they are not a definitive forecast. Developments in climate science, data, methodology, and scenario analysis techniques will help us refine our approach further. Therefore, we anticipate this view of risk to evolve over time. Our company intends to continue strengthening our capabilities for climate scenario analysis and using the results for decision-making, particularly in respect to strategy, by utilizing the range of scenario analysis outcomes to shape our strategy across business and regions. Our company does not currently fully disclose the impacts of transition and physical risk quantitatively due to transitional challenges, including data limitations and evolving science and methodologies."

        "output": "Our initial approach to managing climate risk involved understanding the physical and transition impacts across five priority risk areas: wholesale credit risk, retail credit risk, reputational risk, resilience risk, and regulatory compliance risk. Process - We have integrated climate risk into our existing risk framework, and incorporated it into the policies and controls for the relevant risks where appropriate. We recognize the need for enhanced capabilities and new sources of data.\n\nWe consider greenwashing to be an emerging risk that is likely to increase over time, as we develop capabilities and offerings to help our clients transition to a low-carbon economy. We also acknowledge that green finance taxonomies are not consistent globally, and evolving taxonomies and practices could result in revisions in our sustainable finance reporting going forward.\n\nWe use stress testing and scenario analysis to assess how these climate risks will impact our customers, business, and infrastructure. Integration into policies and procedures - In 2022, we incorporated climate considerations into our mortgage origination process for our retail mortgage business and new money request process for our key wholesale businesses. We also continued to enhance our climate risk scoring tool, which will enable us to assess our customers\u2019 exposures to climate risk. We published our updated energy policy, covering various sectors, and updated our thermal coal phase-out policy.\n\nWe are integrating climate risk into the policies, processes, and controls across many areas of our organization, and we will continue to update these as our climate risk management capabilities mature over time. Consider climate-related risks in traditional banking industry risk categories (supplementary guidance for banks) - In 2022, we expanded our scope to consider climate risk impacts on our other risk areas (including treasury risk and traded risk) in our risk framework. We also analyzed in our internal scenario analysis exercise how climate risks impact how we manage other risks within our organization, including credit risk, and on an exploratory basis: market, operational, liquidity, insurance, and pension risks.\n\nAt our company, we understand that climate risk is a critical issue that requires a comprehensive and integrated approach.

The analysis timeframe spans until 2050, although the International Energy Agency (IEA) scenario only extends to 2040. The estimated cost increases under dynamic and static scenarios are approximately \u00a5120 billion and \u00a5310 billion, respectively. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios we considered are 8.5 (4\u00b0C) and 2.6 (2\u00b0C).\n\nIn assessing potential impacts on our clients' businesses, we applied two scenarios: a static scenario, which assumes no change in the existing business structure, and a dynamic scenario, under which the business structure adapts to the transformation. Our analysis primarily focused on credit costs through 2050.\n\nWe utilized a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the frequencies at which typhoons and other storms cause wind and water-related building loss or damage. We then analyzed the potential direct (collateral value) and indirect (business stagnation) impacts on our company's credit costs from the loss or damage of mortgaged real estate (buildings) in Japan. This analysis targeted middle-market firms and SMEs in Japan. The impact on mortgage lending value was minimal, while the impact of business stagnation was \u00a552 billion at most under both 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C scenarios."

The three most significant risks we face are achieving net zero emissions, potential impact on company reputation, and uncertainties surrounding the development of new energy-saving and carbon-reduction technologies. The three most promising opportunities include the creation and expansion of low-carbon products and services, increasing energy efficiency in customer products, and enhancing our company's reputation.\n\nTransition risks, such as Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) and company reputation, were previously categorized as short-term and mid-term risks, but have now been reclassified as mid-term and long-term risks, respectively. Opportunities, including increasing fabric energy efficiency and promoting low-carbon green manufacturing, were previously considered short-term opportunities but have been revised to mid-term opportunities."

Financial impact analysis of climaterelated risks primarily focuses on market and technology-related costs to reduce carbon emissions, aligning with our Net Zero Emissions by 2050 goal. This includes expenses on energy conservation or carbon reduction facilities, more expensive renewable energy or RECs, carbon credits, and additional costs due to uncertainties in the development of new energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies.\n\nPhysical risks mainly focus on growing electricity costs due to chronic climate changes, such as rising temperatures. Costs related to combating drought include expenses for building water reclamation systems, using reclaimed water, and purchasing backup water sources. For acute climate change disasters like floods and strong winds, we have already designed prevention systems into our facilities and will not be calculating their financial impact.\n\nOur company has also estimated the cost of reputation damage from failing to meet net zero emission targets. However, there is no globally recognized approach to estimate such financial impact, and these calculations are subject to uncertainty. The financial impact of a 1% revenue reduction was a consensus reached by experts after discussions and assessments.\n\nThe financial impact of climate opportunities includes reduced costs from increased energy and water use efficiency and diverse water sources, as well as additional income from providing low-carbon products and services. These may include advanced manufacturing processes, Power Management ICs (PMICs), and ultralow power (ULP) ICs.\n\nAnalysis results indicate that developing low-carbon products and services presents the greatest opportunity for positive financial impacts, as demands for such products continue to grow."

We have considered the outcomes when determining the resiliency of strategies and have also referred to the latest physical science basis, published by reputable organizations such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to develop our own climate scenarios. In addition, we have also included potential growth in carbon emissions from expanding our operations and new facilities as well as existing carbon reduction actions into general evaluations to analyze the potential financial impacts of climate risks. In the past, we evaluated climate risks solely using the worst-case scenario, but the future of climate change is highly unpredictable. As such, we have opted to evaluate climate risks across several scenarios this year to help map out and communicate operations strategies internally and give comprehensive insights into climate trends over the mid-to-long term.\n\nClimate Scenario Selection\nIn terms of transition risks, there is now a global consensus that carbon pricing schemes are a necessary policy to achieve net zero emissions. We have referred to widely used reports, such as the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO) published by the IEA, and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to conduct climate scenario analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing then serves as the basis for us to evaluate the impacts of carbon pricing schemes on our locations in different countries.\n\nIn terms of physical risks, we have referred to the latest reports published by reputable organizations such as the IPCC and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes in the future. We have also adopted the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) to derive GHG emissions under different social and economic landscapes. Our impact analysis on physical risks covers climate change evaluations across every region of the globe and provides detailed impact analysis to our locations and suppliers around the world through downscaling analysis."

We prioritize risks based on their impact on our business, employees, communities, and customers. Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being part of this process.\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is interviewed to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year of 2019. We also have a long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to further reduce our climate impact and support limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and transitioning to a net-zero carbon economy.\nUpstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on the suppliers of our raw materials. As we rely on global suppliers for raw materials, their locations may be subject to various supply constraints, including those due to climate change. In instances where our company depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services, and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change-related risks could affect us. For example, chronic drought or flooding could increase instability in regions of the world that supply critical raw materials, causing business interruption. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses upstream risks by calculating our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Procurement department manages both physical and transitional risks and opportunities in our supply chain. Our dedicated staff, Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy help us manage potential supply chain risks, including those associated with climate change. Where possible, we seek to obtain goods and services from local suppliers in the locations where we conduct business, which helps reduce our risk of business interruptions when climate-related issues may arise and lowers transportation emission impacts.\nDownstream:\nDuring our climate-related risk assessments, we consider the potential impact of climate change on our business downstream. We believe climate change presents a potential opportunity for us because our products are specifically designed to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions compared to incumbent technologies. However, climate-related events could cause delays in product distribution, resulting in commercial risks associated with delivering our products in a timely manner. We use $1 million USD as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\nOur company assesses downstream risks by calculating our downstream scope 3 GHG emissions, which helps us better understand our impact. Our Corporate Sales and Marketing department manages our climate-related transitional risks and opportunities, including those related to our product sales, our reputation, market projections, and consumer preferences.

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal year 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our Business Unit, for instance, has been established with a priority focus on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. Our Business Unit strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization. For example, we have been guaranteeing energy performance contracts since 1995 and have to date enabled our customers to save 13 million tons of CO2.\n\nRegarding our own operations, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. In the current year, we managed to reduce our emissions by half compared to 2014. This program not only reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations but also upstream through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures. The collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment due to a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity, most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nTogether with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis was based on RMS (Risk Management Solution) data. This analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in the U.S., Philippines, or Japan are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our company's Water Strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal Siemens Water Tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in India has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nRegarding potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new project that drives the selection process for new sites and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nThe collected data and information allow us to identify geographical areas where we pay special attention at our sites in terms of risks from changes to physical climate parameters. For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in a certain year as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in a later year and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area. In 2020, we further enhanced our processes for physical risk assessment, as we are faced with a more competitive insurance market with less overall insurer capacity most likely driven by increasing overall impacts of natural disasters.\n\nJointly with our insurer and our risk management partner, we evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see flood risks mainly in certain regions, whereas some sites in other regions are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nThis process is complementary to the implementation of our water strategy. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal year 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites in a certain country has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the rainy season, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater levels during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low, due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, we analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. Due to proven risk indicators such as natural disasters, COVID-19-related lockdown areas, and financial alert data, which will be supported through AI-driven data analytics, we preventively managed several risk cases (e.g., COVID-19, natural disasters) to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

Central components of these mechanisms include enterprise-wide procedures for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning enables us to recognize potential risks prior to significant business moves, while management reporting allows us to closely monitor risks as our business advances. Our internal auditors routinely evaluate the sufficiency and efficiency of our risk management, and any shortcomings can be remedied through suitable measures.\n\nOur risk management strategy is all-encompassing, collaborative, and focused on management, and is embedded within our organization. It encompasses both risks and opportunities. Our strategy is grounded in globally recognized standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO 31000, and is customized to our company's specifications. The frameworks link our risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system.\n\nOur risk management process strives for early recognition and assessment of risks and opportunities that could materially impact our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is generally three years, and we employ a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities that remain after the implementation of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a systematic manner, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting typically follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues in a timely fashion.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on impact and probability, taking into account various viewpoints, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down component ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at various management levels and are incorporated into the subsequent reporting process, if deemed relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are categorized within and for each of the departments mentioned. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. Our response strategies include avoidance, transfer, reduction, acceptance, and capitalizing on opportunities. For each risk or opportunity, responsibility entails the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures are specifically designed to enable effective risk management.\n\nOur company manages various risks, including those related to economic conditions and customer demand, project risks, and risks from the transmission of infectious agents. We closely monitor macroeconomic trends and developments in relevant industries to address the risk of economic instability and fluctuating customer demand. We maintain adequate insurance coverage for potential damage and liability risks to minimize our exposure and mitigate potential losses.

Our internal auditors regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management. If deficiencies are detected, appropriate measures can be adopted for their elimination. This coordination of processes and procedures is intended to help ensure that the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board are fully informed about significant risks in a timely manner.\n\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-oriented, integrated into the organization, and addresses both risks and opportunities. It is based on globally accepted standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO Standard 31000, and is adapted to our requirements. The frameworks connect the risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system.

Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the hierarchical level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. In a first step, assuming responsibility for a specific risk or opportunity involves choosing one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies with respect to risks are avoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance of the relevant risk. Our general response strategy with respect to opportunities is to \"seize\" the relevant opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures have to be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates by engaging in hedging activities. Regarding our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and complemented by clearly defined approval processes, assists us in identifying and responding to project risks at an early stage, even before the bidding phase. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential cases of damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure to such risks and to avoid or minimize potential losses.\n\nWe address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries and adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary.\n\nOur company constantly checks information from reputable sources, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the American and European Centers for Disease Control, and the German Robert Koch Institute, to be able to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible."

Within these pillars, we have identified focus areas where our company can make a significant impact.\n\nWe are confident that our new ESG strategic framework and our long-term goals to decrease carbon emissions and support a fair transition are essential for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and discharge our fiduciary duties. This framework will enable us to manage risk over time and contribute to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Given that transition risk represents the most immediate and impactful financial risk, we have assessed the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio. Our analysis focused on investments where our company holds significant influence and control over the investment process. Preliminary reports were generated using climate-related data and metrics provided by a proprietary vendor tool. This analysis provides a sector-by-sector breakdown of the carbon footprint metrics of our asset book and pinpoints the most carbon-intensive sectors. It also allows us to identify and monitor the most carbon-heavy companies in our asset book. We have also calculated the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) for the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes in our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in markets with varying levels of development. Some markets boast diversified, service-oriented economies and sophisticated financial systems, while others rely heavily on primary industries and energy-intensive sectors. In emerging markets, the energy transition is likely to progress at a slower pace than in advanced economies. This was emphasized by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), during a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. Mr. Menon stated that 'Emerging markets are at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to basic necessities like electricity, modern sanitation, and clean water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most emerging economies remain heavily reliant on fossil fuels for their energy needs, and it is unrealistic to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy overnight.'\n\nFor our company, this implies that while we are dedicated to reducing carbon emissions in our investment portfolio, we recognize the importance of implementing this strategy in a manner that acknowledges the unique characteristics of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition equitably. Our commitment to a fair transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We understand the significance of coalition building in driving a fair transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we collaborate with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale up domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group our company has co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to generate new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."

This will be a company-wide, cross-functional initiative involving participation from our asset owner and asset manager business units, risk, actuarial, and government relations teams.\n\nScenario analysis will be a key area of focus as we plan to integrate it into our mainstream risk management processes during 2021 and begin reporting findings within management information at the company and business unit levels. As we continue to examine how climate risk affects our business in the long term, we aim to implement and expand the use of scenario testing. We plan to voluntarily conduct scenario tests emerging from regulators, such as exploratory climate risk scenarios for financial institutions in 2021.\n\nMany organizations have established targets in alignment with global climate agreements. Our company is in the process of evaluating similar targets regarding the carbon emissions from our investments, given their significance within our overall emissions profile, and our commitment to decarbonizing our investment portfolio.\n\nIn the interim, we continue to raise the bar in relation to our own emissions footprint. This year, we have set new and challenging targets for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, with the goal of achieving net carbon neutrality across these two scopes by the end of 2030. More information on the environmental impact of our direct operations can be found in the Environmental Impact section.\n\nDuring 2021, we will continue to intensify our engagement strategy with key policy and political stakeholders around major climate conferences, with a focus on financial sector issues to support the just transition and sustainable finance priorities, particularly in emerging markets. We recognize that implementing our strategic ESG framework can generate opportunities for our company. Some of these opportunities will come through our efforts to take early mitigating action against the climate risks we identify, including incorporating transition risk into investment decisions to reduce the risk of being exposed to stranded assets. Others will come through supporting an inclusive transition. The infrastructure and capital expenditure required to enable the transition presents attractive investment opportunities in many cases.

Due to challenges in data sourcing and processes, there have been impacts on certain climate disclosures.\n\nClimate scenario analysis is used as a risk assessment tool to provide insights on the long-term effects of transition and physical risks across our corporate and retail portfolios, as well as our own operations. Our sustainable finance ambition enables sustainable infrastructure and energy systems, promotes decarbonisation efforts across the real economy, and enhances investor capital through sustainable investment.\n\nWe aim to achieve net zero in our financed emissions by 2050 and in our own operations and supply chain by 2030. We aim to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn of sustainable finance and investment for our customers in their transition to net zero and a sustainable future.\n\nOur assessment of climate risks covers three distinct time periods: short term (up to 2025), medium term (2026 to 2035), and long term (2036 to 2050). Transition or physical climate-related issues identified are assessed using enhanced questionnaires and scoring tools.\n\nWe support our customers in their transition through our sustainable finance and investment ambition. Our sustainable finance data dictionary includes a detailed definition of contributing activities.\n\nCertain perils, such as coastal, river, and surface water flooding, drive potential credit losses in our retail portfolio. Around 20% of our financed properties are in a major city, and most are protected by a flood barrier.\n\nWe identified six key sectors with the highest exposure to climate transition risk: automotive, chemicals, construction and building materials, metals and mining, oil and gas, and power and utilities. We continued to improve our identification and assessment of climate risk within our retail mortgage portfolio, with increased investments in physical risk data and enhancements to our internal risk assessment capabilities and models.\n\nOpportunities include sustainable finance, sustainable investment, and sustainable infrastructure. For a detailed breakdown of our sustainable finance progress by region, see the ESG Data Pack.\n\nWe report our exposure to high transition risk sectors in our wholesale portfolio. Since 2020, we have rolled out the questionnaire to include our largest customers in the next highest climate transition risk sectors: agriculture, industrials, real estate, and transportation.\n\nAs a result of climate scenario analysis, our largest and most impacted sectors \u2013 power and utilities, construction and building materials, and chemicals \u2013 are subject to increased levels of transition risks. Our asset management division is increasingly considering both physical and transition risks and integrating ESG and climate analysis into the investment decision-making process.\n\nTransition to net zero represents one of our strategic priorities. We aim to be net zero in our operations and supply chain by 2030 and in our financed emissions by 2050. Scenario analysis supports our strategy by assessing our position under a range of climate scenarios and helping us plan for the future and meet growing regulatory requirements.\n\nWe continue to develop our climate scenario analysis exercises to have a more comprehensive understanding of climate headwinds, risks, and opportunities that will support our strategic planning and actions. We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of climate-related issues on financial planning, particularly the impact on financial performance and financial position. We expect to further enhance our disclosure and processes in relation to acquisitions/divestments in the medium term.\n\nClimate change poses a physical risk to the buildings we occupy as an organization, including offices, retail branches, and data centers. We use stress testing to evaluate the potential impact to our owned or leased premises. Our scenario stress test, conducted in 2022, analyzed how seven different climate change-related hazards could impact 500 of our critical and important buildings.\n\nOur Climate Solutions Partnership is a philanthropic initiative that aims to identify and remove barriers to scale for climate change solutions. We support start-up companies developing carbon-cutting technologies, nature-based solutions, renewable energy initiatives, and the WWF-led Asia Sustainable Palm Oil Links programme.\n\nDuring Board meetings, we balance discussions on the company's performance, emerging risks, and duties to shareholders while remaining conscious of responsibilities to support communities and help customers. In 2022, the Board approved an update to the thermal coal phase-out policy and the publication of an updated energy policy. We have committed to publishing our own climate transition plan in 2023."

It enhances our understanding of climate change, enables us to plan for the future, and helps us meet our growing regulatory requirements. In 2022, we conducted our initial internal climate scenario analysis exercise, employing four scenarios to represent the spectrum of potential climate change outcomes. This analysis focused on the key regions where our company operates and evaluated the impact on our balance sheet between the 2022 and 2050 timeframe.\n\nKey performance drivers and their consideration: Climate scenario analysis allows us to model how different potential climate pathways may influence our customer base and investment portfolios, primarily in terms of credit losses. Under the Current Commitments scenario, we anticipate moderate levels of losses related to transition risks. However, the rise in global warming will result in increasing levels of physical risk losses in later years.\n\nGovernment policies and their role in scenarios: The assumptions for our climate stress testing exercise encompass varying levels of governmental climate policy changes, macroeconomic factors, and technological developments. However, these scenarios hinge on the development of technologies that are still uncertain, such as global hydrogen production to decarbonize aviation and shipping. For more information on the assumptions, please refer to our ESG Data Pack.\n\nAdapting strategies in response to climate scenarios: The nature of the scenarios, our evolving capabilities, and the limitations of the analysis result in indicative outcomes of climate change headwinds, although they do not represent a direct forecast. Developments in climate science, data, methodology, and scenario analysis techniques will help us refine our approach further. Consequently, we anticipate this perspective on risk to evolve over time. Our company intends to continue enhancing our capabilities for climate scenario analysis and employ the results for decision-making, particularly in relation to strategy, by utilizing the range of scenario analysis outcomes to shape our strategy across business units and regions. Currently, we do not fully disclose the impacts of transition and physical risk quantitatively due to transitional challenges, including data limitations and evolving science and methodologies."

The analysis timeframe spans until 2050, although the International Energy Agency (IEA) scenario concludes in 2040. The estimated cost increases under dynamic and static scenarios are \u00a5120 billion and \u00a5310 billion, respectively. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios we considered are 8.5 (4\u00b0C) and 2.6 (2\u00b0C).\n\nIn examining potential effects on our clients' businesses, we applied two scenarios: a static scenario, which assumes no change in the existing business structure, and a dynamic scenario, under which the business structure adapts to the transformation. Our analysis primarily focused on credit costs through 2050.\n\nWe utilized a Monte Carlo simulation to ascertain the rates at which typhoons and other storms result in wind and water-related building loss or damage. Subsequently, we analyzed the potential direct (collateral value) and indirect (business stagnation) impacts on our company's credit costs from the loss or damage of mortgaged real estate (buildings) in Japan. This analysis targeted middle-market firms and SMEs in Japan. The impact on mortgage lending value was minimal, while the impact of business stagnation was \u00a552 billion at most under both 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C scenarios."

Financial impact analysis of climate-related risks primarily focuses on market and technology-related costs to help us reduce carbon emissions, in line with our Net Zero Emissions by 2050 goal. This includes expenses on energy conservation or carbon reduction facilities, more expensive renewable energy or RECs, carbon credits, and additional costs due to uncertainties in the development of new energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies.\n\nPhysical risks mainly focus on growing electricity costs due to chronic climate changes, such as rising temperatures. Costs related to combating drought include expenses for building water reclamation systems, using reclaimed water, and purchasing backup water sources. For acute climate change disasters like floods and strong winds, we have already designed prevention systems into our facilities and will not be calculating their financial impact.\n\nOur company has also estimated the cost of reputation damage from failing to meet net zero emission targets. However, there is no globally recognized approach to estimate such financial impact. The financial impact of a 1% revenue reduction was a consensus reached by experts after discussions and assessments. The estimated financial impact from climate opportunities includes reduced costs from increased energy and water use efficiency and diverse water sources, as well as additional income from providing low-carbon products and services such as advanced semiconductor processes, Power Management ICs (PMICs), and ultralow power (ULP) ICs.\n\nAnalysis results indicate that developing low-carbon products and services presents the greatest opportunity for positive financial impacts, as demands for such products and services continue to grow."

Furthermore, we have integrated potential increases in carbon emissions from expanding our operations and new facilities, as well as existing carbon reduction measures, into our evaluations to examine the potential financial consequences of climate risks. Previously, we assessed climate risks solely based on the worst-case scenario; however, the future of climate change is uncertain. Consequently, we have elected to evaluate climate risks under multiple scenarios this year to help design and communicate internal strategies and offer a comprehensive understanding of climate tendencies over the medium-to-long term.\n\nClimate Scenario Selection\nRegarding transition risks, there is a global agreement that carbon pricing mechanisms are essential for achieving net zero emissions. We consulted the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO), an IEA report widely utilized by companies worldwide, and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to perform climate risk analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing serves as the foundation for us to evaluate the implications of carbon pricing schemes on our facilities in various countries.\n\nIn terms of physical risks, we consulted the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) published by IPCC in 2021 and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes in the future. We also adopted the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) to derive GHG emissions under diverse social and economic contexts.

In response to your inquiry, I will discuss the way management evaluates and manages climate-related risks and prospects.\n\n1. Management's approach to assessing and addressing climate-related risks and opportunities:\n\nTo begin with, it is essential for organizations to recognize and understand the climate-related risks and opportunities that may impact their business operations, strategy, and financial performance. This can be achieved through a comprehensive assessment of their climate-related risks and opportunities, which may include physical risks (e.g., extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and natural disasters), transition risks (e.g., regulatory changes, technological advancements, and shifts in market preferences), and reputational risks (e.g., negative publicity, stakeholder pressure, and brand damage).\n\nOnce identified, management should prioritize these risks and opportunities based on their potential materiality, likelihood, and time horizon. This prioritization will inform the organization's risk management strategy, which may include risk avoidance, risk reduction, risk transfer, or risk acceptance.\n\nMoreover, organizations can leverage climate-related data to inform their strategic decision-making process. For instance, they can use climate data to identify potential growth opportunities in emerging markets or industries that are less exposed to climate-related risks. Additionally, they can employ climate modeling to assess the potential impact of climate-related risks on their supply chain, infrastructure, and other critical assets.\n\nIn conclusion, the TCFD framework offers a valuable framework for organizations to disclose and manage climate-related risks and opportunities. By integrating climate-related data into their decision-making process, organizations can enhance their strategic agility, resilience, and long-term sustainability.",

Our Enterprise Risk Management program identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and manages key enterprise risks, with climate-related risks and opportunities being part of this process.\n\nOur Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, and Investor Relations departments identify and assess business risks, financial risks, market risks, and environmental compliance risks. These risks are reviewed as part of financial disclosure requirements. In addition, departments such as Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Sales and Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Investor Relations assess specific physical and transitional risks and opportunities due to climate change. We have evaluated potential physical climate change risks to major facilities, including sea level rise flooding, susceptibility to and preparation for high intensity storms, increased rainfall, drought, and water stress and availability. Both company-level and asset-level physical and transitional risks have been considered, as well as raw material sourcing issues and distribution channel impacts. We use a substantial amount as a threshold for substantive financial impact when determining potential impacts due to climate change.\n\nOur company uses a materiality assessment to review and prioritize sustainability topics, including corporate governance, products, environmental protection (including climate change), social responsibility, and economic performance. Our top management is interviewed to discuss which aspects are most relevant for our company's future success, and external stakeholders are consulted to understand their perspectives. The results from the materiality assessment guide us toward which areas to focus on in the future. Our Environment, Health & Safety department is responsible for maintaining our ISO 14001 certifications. Our ISO 14001 environmental management systems involve assessing environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations, including those impacted by climate change. Significant impacts for each site covered under an ISO 14001 certification are determined using a ranking system.\n\nWe have established corporate-wide goals to manage climate-related risks. Our sustainability goals include a climate change-related target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to a base year.

In response to the inquiries below, I will outline:\n\n1. The organization\u2019s procedures for recognizing and evaluating climate-related risks:\n   Organizations should establish a systematic approach to identifying and assessing climate-related risks. This may involve conducting a materiality assessment to determine which risks pose the greatest threat to the organization\u2019s financial stability and business operations. Climate-related risks can manifest in various forms, such as physical risks (e.g., extreme weather events) and transition risks (e.g., regulatory changes).\n\n2. The organization\u2019s procedures for addressing and mitigating climate-related risks:\n   Organizations must develop a strategy to manage climate-related risks. This may include implementing risk mitigation measures, such as investing in renewable energy sources or adopting energy efficiency practices. Additionally, organizations may need to engage in dialogue with stakeholders, including regulators, industry associations, and NGOs, to address climate-related risks collectively.\n\n3. The integration of the organization\u2019s climate-related risk identification, assessment, and management processes within its broader risk management framework:\n   Organizations should integrate climate-related risks into their overall risk management framework. This can be achieved by aligning climate-related risks with the organization\u2019s risk appetite and risk tolerance. Additionally, organizations may need to update their risk management policies, procedures, and systems to account for climate-related risks. By doing so, organizations can ensure that they are adequately prepared for the financial, operational, and reputational implications of climate-related risks.",

This Annex outlines our disclosure to these recommendations with respective references, where more information can be found. Our climate action governance is overseen by a board-level committee. All strategic sustainability activities are managed by our Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), who is a member of our executive team and chairs our Sustainability Board (SSB). The SSB is the central steering committee for the strategic development of sustainability in our organization. It decides on important sustainability issues and prepares recommendations for our executive team, such as the decision to become carbon neutral by 2030. In this respect, the SSB is responsible for our strategic response to climate change issues along the value chain, including setting targets, KPIs, and reviewing climate change risk and opportunities. For this reporting year, climate change was on the agenda of every SSB meeting, covering topics such as progress in our CO2-Neutral Program or scope 3 emissions within our supply chain.\n\nOur Department of Sustainability supports the CSO in the performance of tasks. The Sustainability Director reports to the CSO and is a member of the SSB. The Department of Sustainability is responsible for observing sustainability trends, analyzing potential impacts on our organization, and preparing decisions for initiatives and pilot projects. This includes defining our climate strategy and managing the CO2 neutral program. The heads of our business units are responsible for strategically considering sustainability issues, including climate change aspects, along the whole value chain within their business activities. This means systematically integrating both sustainability-related business opportunities and business risks in decisions, strategies, processes, and systems, and appointing respective Sustainability Managers. This person maintains a close dialogue with their colleagues and the Department of Sustainability and forms a network of sustainability experts.\n\nSpecialist functions, such as the environmental, health and safety (EHS) department, are responsible for the company-wide implementation of sustainability-related topics in their areas of responsibility. For example, the EHS department performs local climate risk assessments based on the emergency response process or manages greenhouse gas emissions within our own operations. Meanwhile, the Supply Chain Management department supports our business units in managing climate risk within the supply chain. This ensures the full and correct implementation of all climate-related measures and initiatives."

        "output": "Our company does not see any substantial transitional or physical risks from climate change that have a material impact on us, but rather view the transition toward a low carbon economy as an opportunity. Climate change and its mitigation are significant issues for our stakeholders. We enable our customers to lower their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by providing low carbon and energy-efficient products, solutions, and services. Our Environmental Portfolio (EP) helps our customers to mitigate their CO2 footprint, reduce energy costs, and improve profitability through higher productivity. In fiscal 2020, we managed to reduce 150 million metric tons of CO2 at customer sites. Our business focuses on decentralization, decarbonization, and energy efficiency in buildings and cities. Our strategy addresses the ongoing challenges and seizes the opportunities of new technologies around the grid edge with products and solutions for decentralized energy systems, photovoltaic inverters, energy storage, smart and sustainable buildings, and electro mobility, enabled by digitalization.\n\nWe are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. In this year, we managed to halve our emissions compared to a benchmark year. This program reduces potential carbon taxational risk on our operations. Through our dedicated decarbonization program within the supply chain, we also reduce this risk upstream.\n\nWith respect to potential physical risks, we continuously evaluate and monitor changes in climate parameters based on global studies, weather statistics, and trends based on international experience of insurance companies. We do not consider those risks to lead to substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expense as they allow for mitigation. In addition, we perform local risk assessments and develop protection concepts if needed. Furthermore, our insurance department provides natural hazard risks analysis for each new building project that drives the selection process for new site areas and influences technical, organizational, and physical protection measures.\n\nWe evaluate 80% of our insured value with respect to fire safety but also natural catastrophes, such as storms, floods, hurricanes, on a yearly basis. The analysis revealed that major sites were exposed. We see floods exposure mainly in Europe, whereas some sites in other countries are exposed to storms or hurricanes. For these identified sites, a more detailed risk analysis was performed, and results were provided to our insurer to adjust payment conditions. In addition, and in alignment with our overall EHS emergency response management system, we provided measures to be taken by the identified sites, such as installation of flood barriers, thickening of roofs. The requirements for risk mitigation measures are continuously enhanced and consider risk changes.\n\nOur company's Water Strategy is complementary to the physical risk assessment process. Based on our global binding EHS regulation, every environmentally relevant site must perform a risk assessment. This includes the evaluation of water-related climate change risks, such as their water stress level, exposure to flooding, droughts, and general water availability. For this assessment, we use Aqueduct (WRI) and IPCC data to predict changes in precipitation. This assessment is verified by our internal tool with each site responsible for performing a bottom-up analysis. In fiscal 2020, we had analyzed 97% of locations.\n\nOne example for an acute physical risk could be from drought in water-stressed areas. One of our sites has established a comprehensive water management system with active collection of rainwater during the monsoon, which is fed back into the ground to increase necessary groundwater level during the dry season instead of letting it run off through sewers. In addition, the site benefits, as it is more independent from the public water supply.\n\nNatural disasters could potentially interrupt our supply chain. However, supply chain risks are low due to our diversified supplier base, worldwide operations, and a limited number of our company's facilities concentrated in any particular region, including those regions more likely to be affected by natural disasters. We analyze potential supply chain disruptions both within our supplier selection and qualification process as well as in the phase of continuous supply chain operations. Based on external real-time data from service provider risk methods, which indicates risk alerts in any region worldwide, our businesses are mitigating upcoming supply chain risks to ensure flawless deliveries to our customers. We preventively manage several risk cases to ensure the resilience of our supply chain during major crises."

For example, at one of our sites, we installed flood protection measures in 2013 as a preventative measure. This measure was put to the test in 2018 and proved effective, as our site was not impacted despite heavy floods within the area.

Strategic planning helps us identify potential risks prior to major business decisions, while management reporting enables us to monitor risks more closely as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly assess the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management, and any deficiencies can be addressed through appropriate measures.\n\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-oriented, and is integrated into our organization. It addresses both risks and opportunities. Our approach is based on globally accepted standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO 31000, and is adapted to our company's requirements. The frameworks connect our risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system.\n\nOur risk management process aims for early identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially affect our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues in a timely manner.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized based on impact and likelihood, considering different perspectives, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational units mentioned. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. Our response strategies include avoidance, transfer, reduction, acceptance, and seizing opportunities. For each risk or opportunity, responsibility involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures are specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe address various risks, including those related to economic activity and customer demand, project risks, and risks from the transmission of infectious agents. We closely monitor macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries to address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand. We maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure and avoid or minimize potential losses.

This coordination of processes and procedures is intended to help ensure that the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board are fully informed about significant risks in a timely manner.\n\nOur risk management approach is comprehensive, interactive, and management-oriented, integrated into the organization, and addresses both risks and opportunities. It is based on globally accepted standards, such as the COSO Standard and ISO Standard 31000, and is adapted to our requirements. The frameworks connect the risk management process with our financial reporting process and internal control system. They consider our strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of our business operations, the reliability of our financial reporting, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important.\n\nOur risk management process aims for early identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievement of our strategic, operational, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing control measures. Relevant risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way, combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle, with an ad-hoc reporting process to escalate critical issues in a timely manner.\n\nRelevant risks and opportunities are prioritized in terms of impact and likelihood, considering different impact perspectives, including business objectives, reputation, and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant.\n\nReported risks and opportunities are analyzed regarding potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational units mentioned above. Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the hierarchical level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. In a first step, assuming responsibility for a specific risk or opportunity involves choosing one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies with respect to risks are avoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance of the relevant risk. Our general response strategy with respect to opportunities is to \"seize\" the relevant opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation, and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures have to be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management.\n\nWe have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates by engaging in hedging activities. Regarding our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and complemented by clearly defined approval processes, assists us in identifying and responding to project risks at an early stage, even before the bidding phase. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential cases of damage and liability risks to reduce our exposure to such risks and to avoid or minimize potential losses.\n\nWe address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries and adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary.\n\nThere are worldwide risks from the transmission of infectious agents from animals to humans, from humans to humans, and in other ways. Epidemic, pandemic, or other spread patterns such as bioterrorism threaten to cause high disease rates in different countries, regions, or continents. We constantly check information from reputable sources, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the American and European Centers for Disease Control, and the German Robert Koch Institute, to be able to identify epidemic or pandemic risks and related mitigation actions as early as possible."

This framework is fully aligned to our business strategy and our purpose of helping people to get the most out of life, accumulate wealth, and save for their goals. The key features of our ESG framework include its three strategic pillars, which have clear alignment with our business strategy. Within each of these, specific differentiating focus areas have been identified where our company can make a meaningful impact.\n\nWe believe that the new strategic ESG framework and the long-term goals to reduce carbon emissions and support an inclusive transition are an important way for our company to meet stakeholder expectations and fulfill our fiduciary obligations. It will help us manage risk over time, while also contributing to global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Recognizing that transition risk represents the nearest-term and most impactful financial risk, we have conducted an initial analysis of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio. This analysis focused on investments where our company maintains control and exerts influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to the overall carbon footprint metrics of the asset book and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors. It also enables us to determine and monitor the most carbon-intensive companies held in the asset book. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes of our investment portfolio.\n\nOur company operates in various markets with varying levels of development. Some markets have diversified, service-led economies and mature financial markets, while others are more dependent on primary and energy-intensive industries. These emerging markets have a greater reliance on fossil fuels in their generation mix and less developed financial systems. The energy transition across the region is likely to proceed at a slower pace than for advanced economies. This point was highlighted by Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of a Monetary Authority (MA), speaking at a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on October 13, 2020. Mr. Menon noted that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nFor our company, this means that while we are committed to an objective to reduce carbon emissions in our investment portfolio, we are mindful of the need to implement the strategy in a way that acknowledges the nature of the markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition in a fair manner. Our support for an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders. We recognize the importance of coalition building in delivering an inclusive transition. As a member of a Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we work with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia, to scale domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP\u2019s ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group we have co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to catalyze new ideas for scaling up investments to further the SDGs."

        "instruction": "Based on your profound knowledge of the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) framework, I will outline the optimal practices for enhancing transparency and accountability in climate-related financial reporting. I will primarily focus on the role of governance structures and strategic planning in addressing environmental challenges.\n\nFirstly, it is essential to recognize the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on an organization's business operations, strategic direction, and financial planning.\n\n1. Climate-related risks and opportunities can significantly influence an organization's financial performance and strategic objectives. For instance, extreme weather events, regulatory changes, and technological advancements can pose risks to an organization's assets, revenue streams, and supply chains. Conversely, they can also present opportunities for innovation, cost savings, and new markets.\n\n2. To effectively manage these risks and opportunities, organizations must integrate climate considerations into their governance structures and strategic planning processes. This can involve establishing a clear climate risk management policy, appointing a responsible executive or board member, and setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions or increasing renewable energy usage.\n\n3. Organizations should also assess and disclose the potential financial impact of climate-related risks and opportunities in their financial statements and reports. This can help investors and other stakeholders make informed decisions about the organization's financial stability and long-term sustainability.\n\n4. Effective climate risk management and reporting requires ongoing monitoring, assessment, and adaptation. Organizations should regularly review and update their climate risk management policies and strategies in response to changing market conditions, regulatory requirements, and stakeholder expectations.\n\n5. Transparent and accurate climate-related financial disclosures can help build trust and confidence with investors and other stakeholders, and can contribute to a more sustainable and resilient financial system.\n\n6. In conclusion, the TCFD framework provides a valuable framework for enhancing transparency and accountability in climate-related financial disclosures. By focusing on governance structures and strategic planning, organizations can effectively manage climate-related risks and opportunities and contribute to a more sustainable and resilient financial system.",

We will approach this as a company-wide cross-functional initiative, with participation from various business units, risk, actuarial, and government relations teams.\n\nScenario analysis will be an important area of focus as we plan to integrate it into our mainstream risk management processes during 2021 and to begin reporting findings within management information at the company and business unit levels. As we continue to explore how climate risk impacts our business in the long term, we aim to operationalize and increase the use of scenario testing. We plan to voluntarily run scenario tests emerging from regulators, such as exploratory climate risk scenarios for financial institutions in 2021.\n\nMany organizations have set targets in alignment with global climate agreements. We are in the process of assessing similar targets in respect of the carbon emissions from our investments, given their importance within our overall emissions profile, and our commitment to decarbonizing our investment portfolio.\n\nIn the interim, we continue to increase our level of ambition in relation to our own emissions footprint. This year we have set new and stretching targets for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, with the aim of becoming net carbon neutral across these two scopes by the end of 2030. More information on the environmental impact of our direct operations is available in the Environmental Impact section.\n\nDuring 2021, we will continue to scale up our engagement strategy with key policy and political stakeholders around major climate conferences, with a focus on financial sector issues to support the just transition and sustainable finance priorities, particularly in emerging markets. We recognize that the implementation of our strategic ESG framework can generate opportunities for our company. Some of these opportunities will come through our efforts to take early mitigating action against the climate risks we identify, including incorporating transition risk into investment decisions to reduce the risk of being exposed to stranded assets. Others will come through supporting an inclusive transition. The infrastructure and capital expenditure required to enable the transition represents attractive investment opportunities in many cases. For example, there is a role for institutions to both develop new products and invest in structures and mechanisms that enable a managed withdrawal from reliance on coal-powered electricity within developing economies. In response to this, we have developed several responsible investment products that channel our customers\u2019 savings towards ESG-themed investments, such as the Asia Sustainable Bond Fund recently launched by Eastspring. More information on our ESG-related investment activity is available in the Responsible Investment section.\n\nA review is underway to assess suitable targets in respect of the carbon emissions from our investment portfolio. We are also exploring further environmental/climate risk opportunities, such as the development of investment, insurance, and digital products to support climate risk management."

Outline the effects of climate-related risks and prospects on the organization\u2019s operations, decision-making, and financial modeling.\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities can significantly influence an organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning in various ways. Here are some potential impacts:\n\na. Physical risks: Extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and other climate-related phenomena can directly affect an organization's assets and operations. For instance, a utility company may face increased maintenance costs due to more frequent storms, or an agricultural business may experience crop losses due to droughts.\n\nb. Transition risks: The shift towards a low-carbon economy can expose organizations to risks related to regulatory changes, technological advancements, and reputational damage. For example, a coal miner may face stranded assets if carbon pricing policies make coal-fired power generation uneconomical.\n\nc. Reputational risks: Climate change is a pressing issue, and organizations that fail to address it adequately may face negative publicity and loss of customer trust. Conversely, those that demonstrate strong climate action can gain a competitive advantage.\n\nd. Opportunities: Climate-related risks and opportunities can also present new business opportunities. For instance, a renewable energy company may benefit from growing demand for clean energy, or a business that offers climate-resilient solutions can capitalize on the need for adaptation.\n\ne. Financial planning: Climate-related risks and opportunities can impact an organization's financial planning in various ways, such as increased costs, revenue opportunities, and regulatory compliance requirements. It is essential for organizations to consider these factors when developing their financial plans.\n\nOverall, understanding the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on an organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning is crucial for effective decision-making and long-term sustainability.",

I will address the following inquiries:\n\n1. What is the influence of climate-related risks and prospects on the enterprise's operations, strategy, and financial forecasting?\n\nTo begin with, it is crucial for organizations to recognize and understand the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on their businesses, strategies, and financial planning. Climate-related risks can manifest in various forms, such as regulatory changes, physical risks, and transitional risks. These risks can materially affect an organization's financial performance, reputation, and long-term sustainability.\n\nFor instance, a company operating in a region prone to extreme weather events may face increased insurance premiums or disrupted supply chains due to climate-related hazards. Alternatively, a business that relies heavily on fossil fuels may face regulatory pressure to reduce its carbon footprint or face stranded assets as the world transitions to renewable energy sources.\n\nTo effectively manage these risks and opportunities, organizations should integrate climate considerations into their governance structures, strategic planning processes, and risk management frameworks. This may involve appointing a dedicated climate risk officer, setting science-based targets, and conducting climate scenario analyses to identify and prioritize potential risks and opportunities.\n\nMoreover, organizations can employ advanced methodologies such as climate risk assessments, climate scenario analyses, and climate stress testing to gain a better understanding of the financial implications of climate-related risks and opportunities. These analyses can help organizations quantify the potential financial impact of climate-related risks and opportunities, inform decision-making, and enhance their overall climate resilience.\n\nIn conclusion, climate-related risks and opportunities can significantly impact an organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning.

This includes expenses on energy conservation or carbon reduction facilities, more expensive renewable energy or RECs, carbon credits, and additional costs due to uncertainties in the development of new energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies.\n\nPhysical risks mainly focus on growing electricity costs due to chronic climate changes, such as rising temperatures. Costs related to combating drought include expenses for building water reclamation systems, using reclaimed water, and purchasing backup water sources. For acute climate change disasters like floods and strong winds, we have already designed prevention systems into our facilities and will not be calculating their financial impact.\n\nOur company has also estimated the cost of reputation damage from failing to meet net zero emission targets. However, there is no globally recognized approach to estimate such financial impact. The financial impact of a 1% revenue reduction was a consensus reached by experts after discussions and assessments. The estimated financial impact from climate opportunities includes reduced costs from increased energy and water use efficiency and diverse water sources, as well as additional income from providing low-carbon products and services such as advanced manufacturing processes, Power Management ICs (PMICs), and ultralow power (ULP) ICs.\n\nAnalysis results indicate that developing low-carbon products and services presents the greatest opportunity for positive financial impacts, as demands for such products continue to grow."

        "output": "1. In compliance with TCFD recommendations, our company has evaluated the impact of various greenhouse gas (GHG) emission controls on our operations and the supply chain for certain transition and physical risks. We have considered the outcomes when determining the resiliency of strategies and have also referred to the latest physical science basis, published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to develop our own climate scenarios. In addition, we have also included potential growth in carbon emissions from expanding our business and new facilities as well as existing carbon reduction actions into general evaluations to analyze the potential financial impacts of climate risks. In the past, we evaluated climate risks solely using the worst-case scenario, but the future of climate change is highly unpredictable. As such, we have opted to evaluate climate risks across several scenarios this year to help map out and communicate operations strategies internally and give comprehensive insights into climate trends over the mid-to-long term.\n\n2. Climate Scenario Selection\nIn terms of transition risks, there is now a global consensus that carbon pricing schemes are a necessary policy to achieve net zero emissions. We referenced a commonly used report, the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO), and selected the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) and Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) to conduct climate scenario analysis on future carbon pricing. The resulting carbon pricing then serves as the basis for us to evaluate the impacts of carbon pricing schemes on our locations in different countries.\n\n3. In terms of physical risks, we referenced the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) published by IPCC in 2021 and the latest Global Climate Model (GCM) to estimate long-term climate changes in the future. We also adopted a scenario to derive GHG emissions under different social and economic landscapes. Our impact analysis on physical risks covers climate change evaluations across every region of the globe and provides detailed impact analysis to our locations and suppliers around the world through downscaling analysis."

In addition to establishing mid and long-term goals for our four major management initiatives, we conduct annual reviews and make rolling adjustments based on external factors and trends, with the objective of minimizing climate impacts through management by objectives and ensuring business continuity. In response to the increasing carbon costs associated with global low-carbon transitions, we have initiated an internal carbon pricing scheme. This carbon pricing scheme takes into account factors such as regulations, fines, market pricing, and costs of carbon reduction. This scheme incorporates carbon costs into the impact valuations of our daily reduction measures and influences our investment decisions regarding new facilities. For instance, in 2022, we implemented 684 energy conservation measures across eight categories under our energy conservation program, saving approximately 700 GWh in energy that year. Evaluations using our internal carbon pricing scheme indicate that the potential external carbon costs from carbon emission reductions amount to around NT$530 million. We strive to minimize our carbon footprint and contribute to a sustainable future. Our company continually assesses and adjusts our operations to reduce our carbon emissions and promote energy efficiency.

This discussion will focus on the significance of governance, strategic alignment, and risk management practices.\n\nFirst, let's address the climate-related risks and opportunities that the organization has recognized over various time horizons:\n\n1. Short term: What are the immediate risks and opportunities that the business faces due to climate-related events or trends? For instance, extreme weather conditions, regulatory changes, or shifts in market demand could impact the organization's financial performance in the near term.\n2. Medium term: What are the mid-term risks and opportunities that the company may encounter as a result of climate-related factors? These could include technological advancements, changing customer preferences, or evolving regulatory requirements that could influence the organization's competitive landscape and financial position in the medium term.\n3. Long term: What are the long-term risks and opportunities that the business may face due to climate-related issues? These could include the transition to a low-carbon economy, emerging technologies, or geopolitical shifts that could significantly impact the organization's strategic direction and financial prospects in the long term.\n\nBy carefully evaluating and reporting on these climate-related risks and opportunities, organizations can demonstrate their commitment to transparency and sustainability, which is increasingly important to investors, regulators, and other stakeholders.",

For climate scenario analysis, we can run 30-year scenarios for both Physical and Transition Risk. Some elements of our Physical Risk scenario analysis can also extend to 2100.\n\nMethods used to identify material risks and opportunities: We utilize a range of tools and methodologies to assess Transition and Physical Climate Risk, which we apply to our clients, portfolios, and our own operations. These include scenario analysis, location-based hazard and risk scores, temperature alignment scores, and Munich Re's NATHAN tool (acute physical risk impact assessments). In addition, we engage with our corporate clients to understand their transition and physical risks, as well as their plans to prepare for climate change. In 2022, we continued to enhance our understanding of climate-related risks and significantly strengthened our stress testing and scenario analysis abilities for a range of management scenarios that are more plausible.\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities recognized: We have assessed the impact of Climate Risk on our business using scenario analysis over a 30-year time horizon, which has enabled us to identify and mitigate climate risks which may manifest. Sustainability and climate change have moved from being predominantly risk-based initiatives to becoming a value driver. This gives us an opportunity to deploy our market and industry knowledge to advise our clients on their individual sustainability journeys. Sustainable finance is an opportunity to both defend our existing business from Transition Risk and to fund our clients' transition from a high-carbon present to a low-carbon future. Through supporting clients on their net zero journeys and providing further finance to clients as they adapt to be less carbon intensive and emitting over time, we help mitigate their, and our, Transition Risk. Our aim to achieve Sustainable Finance income of $1 billion by 2025 and to mobilize $300 billion of Sustainable Finance by 2030 are measures of this success. We do not fully disclose impacts on financial planning and performance (including proportions of income, costs, and balance sheet related to climate-related opportunities), detailed Climate Risk exposures for all sectors and geographies, or physical risk metrics. Data limitations, and our plans to mitigate these, are discussed in greater detail in the report.\n\nSignificant concentrations of credit exposure to carbon-related assets: We have disclosed our exposures to high-carbon sectors, which includes the expected credit losses on these balances as well as the maturity profiles associated with them. Our exposure to high-carbon sectors makes up 14.4% of our loan balances. We aim to become net zero in our financed emissions by 2050, with interim 2030 targets for our highest emitting sectors. In 2022, we made progress towards this goal and set out to measure, manage, and reduce emissions starting with our most carbon-intensive sectors, in line with our net zero roadmap.

The organization should integrate climate considerations into its overall business strategy, setting targets and goals that reflect its climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nRisk assessment and prioritization are essential components of an effective climate risk management framework. The organization should identify, evaluate, and prioritize climate-related risks based on their potential impact on the business, as well as the likelihood of those risks occurring. This information should be communicated to relevant stakeholders, including the board of directors and investors.\n\nMonitoring and reporting on climate-related risks is an ongoing process. The organization should establish clear reporting lines and procedures for tracking and communicating climate-related risks, as well as regularly reviewing and updating its risk assessment and prioritization.\n\nIn summary, managing climate-related risks requires a strong governance framework, strategic alignment, and effective risk management practices.

This can be achieved through various methods, such as scenario analysis, vulnerability assessments, and the use of climate data. The risks may include physical risks, such as extreme weather events, and transition risks, such as regulatory changes or technological disruptions.\n\nNext, these risks need to be assessed in terms of their potential impact on the organization's operations, financial statements, and reputation. This assessment should be based on the best available data and scientific research, as well as the organization's own experience and expertise.\n\nFinally, climate-related risks need to be managed effectively. This may involve implementing risk mitigation strategies, such as the adoption of renewable energy sources or the development of contingency plans for extreme weather events. It may also involve engaging with stakeholders, such as investors, regulators, and industry associations, to share best practices and collaborate on solutions.\n\nBy integrating climate-related risks into the overall risk management framework, organizations can better understand and respond to the risks and opportunities associated with climate change.
